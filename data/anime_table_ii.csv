#Comment of the Day!! 
 
NullAleph had this to say on the topic of Lain's reaction to literally being adopted. 
>Fuck it. Low effort unpacking: Lain exhibits some pretty extreme distress as soon as she's confronted with details of her delusion. After just talking to someone trying to keep her grounded in reality, it was probably really stressful when someone starts talking about what she may believe is delusion as though it is real, especially because she can't tell if *this* is real or not (I'm just going with ""this is all in her head"", for now). Her Wired persona is probably an alter that developed to protect her from this kind of stress


Weedwacker has some more fun info about our Ojisan ""Nezumi,"" apparently it's Chiaki!! 
> The PoV footage with the guy walking around Shibuya with all of the crazy effects was filmed and processed by the writer, Chiaki Konaka himself, and isn't the work of the series director.

> The cute ojisan character isn't named within the episode but is listed in credits as ""Nezumi"" which means [mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormouse_(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland_character\)) in Japanese.

SIRTreefucker also had some pretty soft comments towards Nezumi... Nezumi love!! I want Nezumi of the Bear Onesie!! 

>The most obvious one is that the knights have a clear divide between real life and the wire. They may be as invested  due to their jobs, but they know their is a distinction and not to get to involved too much. Meanwhile the other guy seems to have abandoned real life entirely and wants to combine the two worlds. He has no life outside of it most likely which I find sad. 

Zadcap got a great read in on the different Lain situation. 
>You know, I've thought it was the same person underneath the whole time, and thought Wired Lain was the real one all along too, but this question is one this episode made me unable to really answer. Is Bear Lain all an act, or is she the Shell that Digital God Lain made for her to inhabit that just happened to have grown a bit of a personality before she could integrate with herself.

A mysterious nameless user had this to say.... 
>""I think love can bloom even on a battlefield and Wired Lain and Bear Lain are making out sloppy style"" 

Himurolo also made us a stitch of the Black Men~

* Meet Lain of the Kusogaki, say something mean to her. 
* Did you have a little teacher crush at school? 
* What's the wildest rumour you've ever come across? 
* Who exactly do you believe Lain of the Kusogaki is? What's your current theory? 
* Do you like teacher student romances in your anime and manga...? This is absolutely not meant to be a creepy question by the way!! I know for a fact that we've got a lot of Shoujo readers in this watch who know exactly what I'm talking about!! 
* How would you cheer up Lain after today's episode?

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!"" 


3bar bullied Nezumi the best

>Even before Google Glasses, there were people making [homebrew versions of something similar](https://i.imgur.com/EFLiGcJ.jpg),  as a way of being always On The Net, recording what they did and such.  Another prediction come true; it wasn't long after SEL that wireless/cell networks expanded enough to be able to be connected to the internet more than just at home and work.  The guy is basically a man-child, walking around with this ridiculous getup, cheering himself on about how great he is, groveling to be accepted into The Knights.  There's even a window bouncing around his view: ""I'm the best"".

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      




Tarhanlindur has details from a wired article that's way above my literacy skill but touches on some deeper themes within Lain. Technopagans is such an awesome term. 

> So, first order of business: in case you missed it, u/mo_fiah was kind enough to dig up a [certain Wired article](https://www.wired.com/1995/07/technopagans/) that I have referenced a few times (mostly under spoiler bars up until now).  The thing is, I am nearly certain that Chiaki J. Konaka read this article himself and/or knew the circles of people it writes about.  Rewatchers are strongly advised to read it (especially our host who keeps asking for help on the show themes).  First-timers may or may not want to read it right now depending on how much you prize being confused by the show, but I do recommend checking it out after we're done if you don't before then.

I kind of remember that there were stats and attack commands in the show. It was a very comedic kind of show, nothing serious. I think that there were characters based on classes, like mages and a knight.

[Spoilers] Please help me find a really old anime movie.,Help,"So please bear with me because Im going to be talking about more than 20 year old memories (I'm amazed that I haven't seen anything past that as well).

The movie was about the usual middle schooler (could be highschool, like said old memories),

 there's a submarine fight/chase in that movie, 

there's a giant crab and lobster in that chase (possibly were robots/Mecha but pilots were never shown).

The main thing I remember was that regular people after overdosing on some drink/possibly drugged drinks would become foam and only clothes would be left. I remember that they wouldn't react strongly to it and would just die.

The authorities I remember closing off the bodies but I also remember everyone not caring about it besides them. It was an often occurrence if I remember correctly.

In the chase scene I mentioned I remember that the crab would shoot foam and that the mini underwater jet drives would become foam because of it as well.

The thing I remember the best is that they were hunting down an underwater base/research center where the main villains were but I remember that they never shown who the f are the main villains, they just blow up it and we win.

If I remember it really well the name of the movie was the same name of the drink that killed everyone, or was it villain groups name?

It's a really old movie, like the animation looked like Gaivers original animes animation.

The middle part i mostly forgot but in the end some black power or so was about to destroy some fantasy city with some friends of them in there.
The guy still wanting his wish didnt stop (to stop the dark power or so) ended up fighting a dark version of himself on ice with the wish by the kid beeing to safe the friends or so.

This looks like the right place to ask, so I'm going to try here first. From what I remember about the plot:

The unborn child of a god and a priestess starts showing off his powers trying to make his parents proud, only to find that his dad's a jealous POS and feels threatened by him and his mom worships the ground his dad walks on and would happily get rid of him if his existence wasn't wanted by his dad. Knowing this, he decides he doesn't need them anyway and strikes off on his own, the only problem being that he's still just a fetus. He needs someone to give birth to him. He needs *his* mother to give birth to him, but since she's a POS he decides the next best thing is the version of her from a parallel world (not sure about that detail, if it's her other version or just a rando he liked, but it sounds about right). So he goes into said person because he likes them way better than his own mother. Only problem, this person is a teenage *boy*. At the same time, other people with powers from the other dimension start possessing people from our world in an attempt to get the baby back. The protagonists best friend becomes possessed but rejects the idea of turning against him and overpowers the possessor, becoming an odd mix of the possessed and possessor with superpowers and the only goal of keeping the protagonist safe and protected.

I'm fairly sure the boy turns into a girl once he fully accepts and agrees to have the kid, but idk. I don't remember any character names or what they look like (I think one of them had dark blue hair, not that that helps). I'm pretty sure the protagonists female friend winds up being possessed by the god or something, but I really don't know. Anyway, that's what I remember. I know this doesn't sound like a very mainstream anime/manga/whatever, but if anyone can help me, please do. It's bugging the holy living crap out of me.",False,anime,1705947759.0,19d2e33

Kensuke Ushio and the effect of music in media (The Dangers in My Heart),Discussion,"I've recently gone down a rabbit hole of Kensuke Ushio's work and wanted to take some time to write a bit of a retrospective regarding Kensuke Ushio, his work as a composer, and why I love his music so much.

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Kensuke Ushio's work elevates the media it is associated with regardless of what type of anime it is and ultimately creates an atmosphere that the show would otherwise probably not have without it.**

Some minor spoilers ahead.

&#x200B;

Kensuke Ushio I believe is probably most famously known for his work in *A Silent Voice* and *Chainsaw Man*, both shows with insane visuals, plots full of depth, and an insanely large fanbase/following. However, I recently have caught up completely with *The Dangers in My Heart* of which I was very surprised to see have its score composed by Ushio. After having only known *A Silent Voice* and *Chainsaw Man* as his more popular gigs, I was surprised to see a romcom of which (to my knowledge) doesn't have nearly as large of a following as the former. I found myself greatly enjoying the wholesome plot behind *The Dangers in My Heart* and have recently come to a realization that the score plays a huge part in why. I'd like to go a bit into depth on a few tracks and how I perceived them to make my point.

&#x200B;

**hearts get closer**

I most vividly remember this track as the one that plays after Ichikawa and Yamada's date on Christmas Eve in S1E10. After an action packed day of shopping and other activities, the two hold hands on the train back home to not lose each other in the crowd, eventually getting lost in the idea of when to let go and simply holding on for the entire walk home. It's a pretty quiet moment overall and this track truly encapsulates that feeling of an overwhelming feeling juxtaposed to a moment of bliss. Even though both characters are surely feeling their hearts pounding through their chest, they find themselves closer than ever in a brisk, late night walk with no one else around which is heard clearly through this track.

&#x200B;

**sweet devil**

There is no specific memory I have for this track other than that I associate it with the small and cute moments that Ichikawa and Yamada share. The innocence of their relationship slowly blossoming into something greater as they mature is exemplified through this track which exhibits a somewhat child-like innocence that is backed with the sound of a thumping heartbeat as they begin to explore what this newfound feeling for each other exactly is.

&#x200B;

**the shine**

Oh man, what a track this is. You can almost close your eyes and feel the emotion that Ushio poured into this track, a prime example of the masterclass of storytelling with music that he composes. Many know this track from S1E1 when Ichikawa notices Yamada is being bothered by an upperclassman who doesn't know how to take no for an answer. The piano in the beginning of the track can be understood as ""Well, why do I care if she's being bothered? What difference does it make to me?"". It's a feeling of hopelessness in not feeling important to someone, feeling that your actions will hold no value regardless of how you feel. Suddenly, Ichikawa, seemingly possessed by some otherworldly force, tosses his bicycle toward Yamada and the upperclassman in an effort to distract them and get his attention away from her. The orchestra comes in with a bold statement, almost feeling like it has completely evolved from the track it started as, pairing with the idea that Ichikawa has suddenly felt a rush of emotion that is alien to him, the emotion of *love.* It's unfamiliar, exciting, and causes you to do things that you'd never expect out of yourself, just as this track was never expected to be more than a soft piano solo. It's the beginning of something new, *the shine* of a new path that Ichikawa and Yamada will soon find themselves on.

&#x200B;

As a musician myself, I couldn't help but feel so drawn to the score that Kensuke Ushio has composed. When I added this anime to my watchlist, I truthfully didn't think much of it. Just another romcom where I can watch after a long day at work and turn off my brain to. And on paper, it really does seem like that kind of show. A shut-in MC falling for a girl that is completely out of his league, gee never heard of that kind of plot before. Yet somehow, such a revered composer finds himself at the forefront of storytelling for this anime. What started as another show on the watchlist became one of my top romance anime of all time (so far) and it's thanks to Ushio for elevating the already wonderful and wholesome storyline to a new level that kept me wanting more and more, not only from Ushio himself, but from *The Dangers in My Heart*.",False,anime,1705946057.0,19d1ola

Is Sakuga really all its cracked up to be?,Discussion,"The CRAs are in season, and with that another slate of 6 action show get nominated for best animation like clockwork (ok *Trigun Stampede* is kinda based and kinda deserves it, but that's besides the point). Nam-style flashbacks to the 2018 show where MHA beat out *A Silent Voice* for the category aside, its gotten me thinking about how we view what makes a show have ""good animation"". I think we can all probably agree what makes for good animation, but how we apply that to a series as a whole seems to vary. 

The prevailing opinion seems to be if a show has those well-animated ""money shots"" at key moments then the show at large is well animated. However, I want to counter that filling your show with 90% of static shots and mouth flaps to fill 5 seconds where it counts doesn't necessarily constitute ""well-animated"" on a wholistic scale.

I think its the smaller more subtle cuts where the animation of a show should be measured. If the goal is to create a coherent and consistent world and setting, then having something as wildly inconsistent as JJK S2 shouldn't be put as high as the far more consistent *Do It Yourself* or *Frieren.* There's certainly exceptions for something like *Bocchi the Rock!* where the drastic shifts in animation style are part of the joke, but even then Bocchi is chock full of more subtle cuts that get the love they deserve. Is *Pokémon XY* really peak Pokémon animation when it reuses a lot of canned animations and static shots to cover over the smaller moments or *Pokémon Sun & Moon* whose animation bleeds down all the way to its episodic character animation (ignoring the battles too which are also godly, just what were they cooking back in 2016)?

My other reason for asking is seeing a lot of the discourse that surfaces around classic cel anime, their ""aesthetic"" and how that feels like its going away with more modern anime (for better or worse). I think a lot of the reason why anime lacks the strong aesthetic of those classic shows is shows prioritizing their ""money shots"" a lot more at the cost of the rest of the show not getting as much polish. Sure we'll get a *Frieren* every now and then, but it is by far an exception and not the rule. I think this industry shift has been promoted by how we view animation and favor these key scenes over the whole product and think we should look at a show in its entirety before coming to conclusions on animation.

But what do y'all think? Would you want less extremely polished action scenes to give more time to the rest of the show or is the current precedent fine? Do you feel anime aesthetic has improved or gotten worse over time? What do you look for in a ""well-animated"" show? Do you too have nightmares of CGI horses?",False,anime,1705932147.0,19cwb84

I'm not so sure Frieren is as popular as everyone makes it out to be,Discussion,"I have a legit reason for this opinion.

You might be familiar with a store called Animate- probably the largest chain for anime goods in Japan,  Living in Japan, i went to one of the larger stores yesterday- to be specific, one of the ones in Nagoya. 

Considering they're a goods retail store, it makes sense that they'd want to capitalize on trending anime.  Certainly, they've got tons of your popular series- MHA, Spy x Family, and of course the longer-running series.  I was there for another show myself, but I decided to look for Frieren.

Now, I've found that merch does vary by store, and maybe ones in Tokyo or Osaka have more, but Nagoya is still a pretty big city.  And yet, there was next to no Frieren merch, beyond a handful of acryllic stands and a bag.  This was kind of shocking and disappointing- I'm pretty sure Frieren is confirmed for a second season, so the fact that there is so little merch for a 2-cour series... maybe Frieren isn't so popular and so not much merch is being made for it?

Anime movies that features realistic travel scenes across modern japan?,What to Watch?,"I'm looking for anime movies (not series) that feature some or many realistic travel scenes with varied modern travel methods (cars, trains, boat, planes, ...) across modern japan or the world (post year 2000 or even more preferably post 2010).

I wonder if Bang Bravern can save the mecha genre,Discussion,"Just saw the first episode, and maybe it’s just me, but holy cow did the show feel so epic as lately I had been watching a bunch of classic mecha anime from between the late 70s to early 80s, then I decided to go check out Bang Bravern to see if how the genre had been doing in modern times, and it seems to be pretty fun so far.




I don’t know if anyone has been anticipating this particular show, but even though it’s brand new, I hope it can succeed as while Witch from Mercury was a good show, it suffered towards the end due to being a bit rushed, so I just hope that Bang Bravern doesn’t befall the same fate.",False,anime,1705905331.0,19cpens

"Help me Identify an Anime - White-Haired Protagonist, Dark Polluted World, and Mysterious Monsters",Help," 

I'm trying to find an anime, and I hope the community can help me out. Here's a brief description of the plot:

The story revolves around a guy living in a dark, polluted world, possibly in poverty. One day, he gets mysteriously transported to another world where monstrous creatures or dragons choose humans to fight alongside. In this new world, he discovers that he has been chosen by a powerful monster. As the plot unfolds, the protagonist's supposedly disappeared mother returns, revealing that when she was pregnant with him, she was being trained because she believed the same monster had chosen her. However, it turns out that the monster had chosen her unborn child (the main character). There's a twist where the mother, feeling resentment, tries to harm or kill her son because she wasn't chosen.

The anime may have a title or the main character's name with a ""Z"" in it. Additionally, the main character has white or grey hair.

If anyone recognizes this description or has any leads, please let me know the title of the anime. I appreciate your help!",False,anime,1705902697.0,19cop1t

Need helping finding a specific anime,Help,"Sorry if this is super vague, but all Ive got is my fuzzy ass memory on the matter with barely any leads.

Im trying to find a very specific anime that id forgotten the name to and the names to the characters. I cant shake the feeling that it's Devilman, but thats probably super wrong. Everytime I look something even remotely close to what im searching for, nothing of its likeness seems to ever come up.

Lets cut to the chase. There are three very distinct images I get in my head when I try to search my memories for this anime. The first is of a young adult, maybe im his 20s, that suffers from anger issues. He is dark-skinned and has a pretty striking similarity to Akira from Devilman. He's got the ability to transform into a demon or devil like monster each time he is enraged and loses control. He recall a fight scene of him and his childhood from fighting to the death on a rooftop of a building somewhere in the slums. The friend has white hair, is pale skinned and uses a mobile humanoid mech suit to fight.

The second image I have in my mind is of the devil man in a ruined building, close to death from a different fight with his mech friend after trying to save a girl. The mech suit friend has this sort of righteous personality where he believes himself the savior from this devil man. So he is ok with sacrificing one life for many, whilst the devil man is not and is also in love with this girl.

The last image which is also my strongest:

The devilman is a young boy, light skinned, long ungroomed hair, as if homeless. He is walking in a park, enranged and hunting a frog face demon that is disguised as a man. This frog face demon uaed his tongue as a weapon to hunt humans and i think the boys mother was one of the victims. The frog face demon has a blade at the tip of his tongue. When the boy finds him, he beats the shit out of him in a pretty badass way.


This is all I can remember and no matter how much I search, I cannot find it but it sits so strongly in my mind to be all in my head.

Favorite moments in anime where the protagonist went from a blockhead to genius,Discussion,"I don’t know why, but for some reason I felt like discussing a trope in anime that fascinates me, and it’s the moment where a protagonist that didn’t seem to be very bright was shown doing very amazing, such as finding the enemy’s weakness.




Like I don’t know if Chainsaw Man himself would fall under the trope as at first, he just looks like the kind of guy that just wants to score with babes, but then as the series goes on, he is shown to be a very competent fighter in battle as he can somehow wield 3 enormous chainsaws without impaling himself.

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
Unboxiois finally made it!! He has a fun story about the hidden 7 black presidents which leads me to asking, which ones!? XD 
>I met a guy IRL once who was convinced that ancient Egypt didn't exist and that the US had 7 black presidents who were president before George Washington. That's more of a conspiracy theory than a rumor, but these things aren't so different, are they?


Zadcap made an aspiring comment yesterday about how despite the Clamp girls being genuine degenerates who should be behind bars, that they kinda have a point. 
> The worse part is, as a young and impressionable child, CCS was a gateway into the rest of CLAMP as much as it was the start of my eternal Mahou Shoujo love. There was not a single forbidden romance those ladies didn't try to put on paper, and I read more taboo love stories than I can remember before I learned about the ideas of them being a taboo in the first place. So I grew up to know, as long as it's safe and consensual, then there's really nothing wrong with it just let love be love. -says someone who is going to die single lol

The way the eye looks like a sunset, like someone's soul is sinking in flames. Listen. I'm not here to be some insistent LainxAlice shipper. Alice at least has, um, other interests? But they had something, right? lluNhpelA was just talking about it. You can absolutely how people could see it that way, especially once you get the idea of what it is that Alice has been trying to downplay and trust her friend about. And there's unpraiseworthy Lain, intruding from the corner with the face of a thousand memes. This scene has to be what it is to establish ideas about Lain and Alice's relationship, to put something under a cup so that when the carnie spins it around, you feel liike you know where it's gone. Yeah, she has a nice cat-got-the-cream look later, the classic ""my life now, Lain of the bedroom, enjoy the metaphorical-metaphysical cuck chair"" expression. But I can't help but sympathise. Poor Lain of the Other Side! Our girl had a bear onesie AND a best friend. Our other girl had... what? The head may not say it, but the heart knows that this episode is for the sake of LOVE.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      




Quiddy pog! 

> We'll see if I change my mind with what's left, but this has historically been my favorite episode of the show. An emotionally charged episode with the Alice - Lain stuff, the other Lain being quite over the top and some interesting imagery as well. Some good range from Bridget Hoffman in this episode playing two different versions of Lain. The whole concept of how one can be a totally different person online, one who can be totally unrestrained and become quite a horrible person I think has been a theme built up from earlier on, but really comes to a head here. Was Alice really having a relationship with that teacher? My position is no, she just fantasized about him. If anything I feel more strongly about it due to thematic stuff we get in the next episode. Which I'll have to wait until then to discuss.

Netflix and its horrible subtitles.,Discussion,"So like the title says, but what the hell is the deal with Netflix subtitles?

To gives a little bit of info, I primarily sail the seas to watch anime, Plex server, Sonarr etc etc well last night my plex wasnt working and i didnt feel like messing with it because it was late, i turned on Netflix on a friends account. I scrolled through and decided I will start watching My Happy Marriage, it was on my watchlist but never got around to it.

For starters, the show is great, im only on episode 8 but such a great show.

The bad is the subtitling. Holy shit, im not sure what is worse, the terrible translations or the god awful timing on everything. The last time i really watched a netflix exclusive anime was Komi Cant Communicate, and i remember episode 1 of that was just horribly translated to the point where i waited for fan subs/encoders to fix it.

I went ahead and watched My Happy Marriage on my Plex and the corrected subtitles, and its noticeably different and better.

Honestly I really want to watch Delicious In Dungeon but im thinking of just waiting it out because so far, netflix is 0 for 2 in terms of subtitling quality.",False,anime,1706045438.0,19dzlcb
LF Recommendation: Ecchi/Hentai/Nylon for couple new to it,What to Watch?,"As the title says, recently my GF got into hentai. So she asked me to look for some good high-quality erotic/romantic content that we can both watch and enjoy it together. 

If it helps, we're both really into nylon, pantyhose, tights and this kind of stuff, so we would appreciate something around it.

Since we're new to it I thought of starting with some Ecchi light stuff, I've read about Miru Tights, but it seems a bit too much to begin with. Maybe Saekano is a good option?

Also, feel free to recommend some more explicit content as well, since we're probably going to watch it later. Nothing crazy like tentacles or sci-fi stuff please. If it's funny and has a great story is a big plus.

My main issue with a sign of affection,Discussion,"Let me start things off by saying i actually like this anime and i like its representation of people who are deaf, i love the character designs, and i love the setting of the story in college rather than high school.

My main problem with this anime is that i dont see the connection between the main girl and main guy at all. She gets a crush on him and then just immediately decides shes in love with him after she barely just met him and she barely had any interactions with him. I know this is the message they are trying to push with you just fall in love and you can decide when you are in love but still it just doesn’t make sense.

In contrast the second guy seems to be much more caring. I know hes a tsundere but deep down he cares for her and learned sign language for her and wants her safety but i know hes going to lose which is making my interest in this anime drop every episode.

The main guy is so touchy like he literally touches her without her consent and gets close to her without even asking at all. In real life this would be classified as some weird behavior but in this anime its portrayed as normal because hes “hot”",False,anime,1706045077.0,19dzg0u

Anime with the most solid soundtracks in your opinion?,Discussion,"What are the shows with the overall best music? Not just one or two good OPs but also the EDs and OSTs?

Literally not a single miss and it fits the feeling of fleeting youth of the anime so well. Especially the OSTs, I remember not being able to find those soundtracks until years after I actually watched the show 

Given is a close second too. A 1-season sorta-niche BL has no right to have a soundtrack this godly. Sets the standard for ANY music anime imo. I love Bocchi and Kongming too but they don't even come close to Given's soundtrack imo, any of the songs from Given has the potential to be a j-rock classic

I remember watching naruto, fairy tail etc and felt there was more daily life scenes and non-battle character interactions back then.

For the main characters, there was a girl and a dude adventuring together. The guy is kind of silly and can turn into a badass looking dragon, but I think it may only be if he is in a lot of trouble/ very hurt. I don't remember much about the girl. 

In the episode, the two are captured and are taken into a palace where they are strung up on a cross and semi- tortured. In the palace, there is a princess who is very hardened and cold. Later in the episode, it is revealed that the princess had been brainwashed and the real king and queen had been murdered by the current fake king and queen (i think there was a fire?). I think the adventurers try to help the princess, but from my memory, it was a bittersweet ending, and the dude turned into a dragon, destroyed a bunch of stuff, but I think the princess ended up dying. In the end, the girl flew away in the back of the dragon. 

I remember the art style having a lot of red tones and the overall tone of the anime was more somber than light hearted.

Please help me solve this mystery!
Thanks so much in advance, everyone!",False,anime,1706004976.0,19dl9nk

The other one is, the mc doesn't want others to know how strong he is so he hides his powers, they try to teach him how to use magic but because he hides his real powers everyone thinks he's weak, I remember a scene when a girl tries to teach him how to walk on water but he can't and when the girl leaves he stands up (still on the water) and tells how tiring it is to hide his powers",False,anime,1706004773.0,19dl7xz

Looking for a particular anime that I can't remember the name of,Help,"I feel like I remember watching at least some of it if not the entirety of the first season but it was a while ago. Let me try to break down some key points.


There's a 'Tower' of sorts, and it costs a lot to get into it I believe, but our main character got either teleported or isekai'd to a high floor of the tower, can't remember exactly, just know he's gotten there completely by accident.


Our main character ends up stuck in a cave or cavern but ends up gardening in there with the help of bees that end up being of the monster girl variety and clearly think very highly of him. Things are working out great, as far as being stuck in a cave goes.


I think that he was contacted at some point by some higher power within the system of the world to figure out how he ended up there?


Anything here ringing any bells for anyone? Google hates me and just keeps sending me to a manwa that's got a somewhat similar premise but it's definitely not the right thing.

Need helping finding a specific anime,Help,"Sorry if this is super vague, but all Ive got is my fuzzy ass memory on the matter with barely any leads.

Im trying to find a very specific anime that id forgotten the name to and the names to the characters. I cant shake the feeling that it's Devilman, but thats probably super wrong. Everytime I look something even remotely close to what im searching for, nothing of its likeness seems to ever come up.

Lets cut to the chase. There are three very distinct images I get in my head when I try to search my memories for this anime. The first is of a young adult, maybe im his 20s, that suffers from anger issues. He is dark-skinned and has a pretty striking similarity to Akira from Devilman. He's got the ability to transform into a demon or devil like monster each time he is enraged and loses control. He recall a fight scene of him and his childhood from fighting to the death on a rooftop of a building somewhere in the slums. The friend has white hair, is pale skinned and uses a mobile humanoid mech suit to fight.

The second image I have in my mind is of the devil man in a ruined building, close to death from a different fight with his mech friend after trying to save a girl. The mech suit friend has this sort of righteous personality where he believes himself the savior from this devil man. So he is ok with sacrificing one life for many, whilst the devil man is not and is also in love with this girl.

The last image which is also my strongest:

The devilman is a young boy, light skinned, long ungroomed hair, as if homeless. He is walking in a park, enranged and hunting a frog face demon that is disguised as a man. This frog face demon uaed his tongue as a weapon to hunt humans and i think the boys mother was one of the victims. The frog face demon has a blade at the tip of his tongue. When the boy finds him, he beats the shit out of him in a pretty badass way.


This is all I can remember and no matter how much I search, I cannot find it but it sits so strongly in my mind to be all in my head.

Like I don’t know if Chainsaw Man himself would fall under the trope as at first, he just looks like the kind of guy that just wants to score with babes, but then as the series goes on, he is shown to be a very competent fighter in battle as he can somehow wield 3 enormous chainsaws without impaling himself.

I am talking about - land of lustrous s2, yona of the dawn s2, claymore and Tokyo ghoul remake, baccano! s2, no game no life s2, berserk, grimgar s2, bloom into you s2, hyouka, doroedoro, etc

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
Unboxiois finally made it!! He has a fun story about the hidden 7 black presidents which leads me to asking, which ones!? XD 
>I met a guy IRL once who was convinced that ancient Egypt didn't exist and that the US had 7 black presidents who were president before George Washington. That's more of a conspiracy theory than a rumor, but these things aren't so different, are they?


Zadcap made an aspiring comment yesterday about how despite the Clamp girls being genuine degenerates who should be behind bars, that they kinda have a point. 
> The worse part is, as a young and impressionable child, CCS was a gateway into the rest of CLAMP as much as it was the start of my eternal Mahou Shoujo love. There was not a single forbidden romance those ladies didn't try to put on paper, and I read more taboo love stories than I can remember before I learned about the ideas of them being a taboo in the first place. So I grew up to know, as long as it's safe and consensual, then there's really nothing wrong with it just let love be love. -says someone who is going to die single lol

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!"" 


DegenerateRegime fights in the name of LOVE! 

>That's not the [right prompt](https://i.imgur.com/jLs1VgR.png). Look at that [=w=](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyugfHPOFBE) homewrecker. The way the eye looks like a sunset, like someone's soul is sinking in flames. Listen. I'm not here to be some insistent LainxAlice shipper. Alice at least has, um, other interests? But they had something, right? lluNhpelA was just talking about it. You can absolutely how people could see it that way, especially once you get the idea of what it is that Alice has been trying to downplay and trust her friend about. And there's unpraiseworthy Lain, intruding from the corner with the face of a thousand memes. This scene has to be what it is to establish ideas about Lain and Alice's relationship, to put something under a cup so that when the carnie spins it around, you feel liike you know where it's gone. Yeah, she has a nice cat-got-the-cream look later, the classic ""my life now, Lain of the bedroom, enjoy the metaphorical-metaphysical cuck chair"" expression. But I can't help but sympathise. Poor Lain of the Other Side! Our girl had a bear onesie AND a best friend. Our other girl had... what? The head may not say it, but the heart knows that this episode is for the sake of LOVE.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      




Quiddy pog! 

> We'll see if I change my mind with what's left, but this has historically been my favorite episode of the show. An emotionally charged episode with the Alice - Lain stuff, the other Lain being quite over the top and some interesting imagery as well. Some good range from Bridget Hoffman in this episode playing two different versions of Lain. The whole concept of how one can be a totally different person online, one who can be totally unrestrained and become quite a horrible person I think has been a theme built up from earlier on, but really comes to a head here. Was Alice really having a relationship with that teacher? My position is no, she just fantasized about him. If anything I feel more strongly about it due to thematic stuff we get in the next episode. Which I'll have to wait until then to discuss.

Netflix and its horrible subtitles.,Discussion,"So like the title says, but what the hell is the deal with Netflix subtitles?

To gives a little bit of info, I primarily sail the seas to watch anime, Plex server, Sonarr etc etc well last night my plex wasnt working and i didnt feel like messing with it because it was late, i turned on Netflix on a friends account. I scrolled through and decided I will start watching My Happy Marriage, it was on my watchlist but never got around to it.

For starters, the show is great, im only on episode 8 but such a great show.

The bad is the subtitling. Holy shit, im not sure what is worse, the terrible translations or the god awful timing on everything. The last time i really watched a netflix exclusive anime was Komi Cant Communicate, and i remember episode 1 of that was just horribly translated to the point where i waited for fan subs/encoders to fix it.

I went ahead and watched My Happy Marriage on my Plex and the corrected subtitles, and its noticeably different and better.

Since we're new to it I thought of starting with some Ecchi light stuff, I've read about Miru Tights, but it seems a bit too much to begin with. Maybe Saekano is a good option?

Also, feel free to recommend some more explicit content as well, since we're probably going to watch it later. Nothing crazy like tentacles or sci-fi stuff please. If it's funny and has a great story is a big plus.

My main issue with a sign of affection,Discussion,"Let me start things off by saying i actually like this anime and i like its representation of people who are deaf, i love the character designs, and i love the setting of the story in college rather than high school.

My main problem with this anime is that i dont see the connection between the main girl and main guy at all. She gets a crush on him and then just immediately decides shes in love with him after she barely just met him and she barely had any interactions with him. I know this is the message they are trying to push with you just fall in love and you can decide when you are in love but still it just doesn’t make sense.

In contrast the second guy seems to be much more caring. I know hes a tsundere but deep down he cares for her and learned sign language for her and wants her safety but i know hes going to lose which is making my interest in this anime drop every episode.

The main guy is so touchy like he literally touches her without her consent and gets close to her without even asking at all. In real life this would be classified as some weird behavior but in this anime its portrayed as normal because hes “hot”",False,anime,1706045077.0,19dzg0u

Looking for a specific 2010s released anime,Help,There was this anime who had only 1 season I believe. It was an isekai : a boy from modern world switches places with a prince? from a fantasy word that was hunted i think? The boy had a female companion and a male red headed companion. The characters had cool weapon powers and the art was beautiful. One of the antagonists was a red haired guy with visible abs but turned out later to be an anti hero.,False,anime,1706021878.0,19dq9g4

Help remembering some anime,Help,"Im sorry for the lack of info, this is a anime i watched at least two years ago and me and my fiance are trying to recall what it was. 

This girl (girl 1)  and man are obsessed with some online mmo. The man has no money, so hes been staying in overnight cubicles in japan with computers to play the game. Eventually he loses all his money to even do that- one of the girls (girl 2) who stays at the same place in the snack room offered her stall for him to stay in. That girl (girl 2) plays the game with him, and she tells him if he loves the other girl (girl 1) he needs to go talk to her.

Anime with the most solid soundtracks in your opinion?,Discussion,"What are the shows with the overall best music? Not just one or two good OPs but also the EDs and OSTs? 

The anime that would fit perfectly into that criteria for me would be Kimi to Boku. None of the songs are what I would listen to usually but the entire soundtrack is god-tier for emotion and nostalgia. Literally not a single miss and it fits the feeling of fleeting youth of the anime so well. Especially the OSTs, I remember not being able to find those soundtracks until years after I actually watched the show 

Given is a close second too. A 1-season sorta-niche BL has no right to have a soundtrack this godly. Sets the standard for ANY music anime imo. I love Bocchi and Kongming too but they don't even come close to Given's soundtrack imo, any of the songs from Given has the potential to be a j-rock classic

JJK - what to expect?,Help,"Not complaining, just trying to figure something out and get opinions because no one I know watches anime.

It's been quite a few years since I've seen a battle-shounen but is it just me or does JJK seem particularly heavy with non-stop balls-to-the-wall fighting action? I like the overall plot pacing and the fights are fantastic.

I remember watching naruto, fairy tail etc and felt there was more daily life scenes and non-battle character interactions back then.

I love the characters in JJK but some on my favourite scenes are when they go shopping or when they do that random baseball match.

 I just get tired after watching more than 2 or 3 episodes from all the back-to-back fights lol. Did I just get older and can't handle the adrenaline now?  Is that manga any different?",False,anime,1706005320.0,19dlcmy
Help me find the title of this anime?,Help,"I saw this anime like 20+ years ago and cannot for the life of me figure out what it is, despite searching multiple times over the years. I only saw one episode and really want to watch the rest if I can figure out what it is...

For the main characters, there was a girl and a dude adventuring together. The guy is kind of silly and can turn into a badass looking dragon, but I think it may only be if he is in a lot of trouble/ very hurt. I don't remember much about the girl. 

In the episode, the two are captured and are taken into a palace where they are strung up on a cross and semi- tortured. In the palace, there is a princess who is very hardened and cold. Later in the episode, it is revealed that the princess had been brainwashed and the real king and queen had been murdered by the current fake king and queen (i think there was a fire?). I think the adventurers try to help the princess, but from my memory, it was a bittersweet ending, and the dude turned into a dragon, destroyed a bunch of stuff, but I think the princess ended up dying. In the end, the girl flew away in the back of the dragon. 

I remember the art style having a lot of red tones and the overall tone of the anime was more somber than light hearted.

Please help me solve this mystery!
Thanks so much in advance, everyone!",False,anime,1706004976.0,19dl9nk

Looking for a particular anime that I can't remember the name of,Help,"I feel like I remember watching at least some of it if not the entirety of the first season but it was a while ago. Let me try to break down some key points.


There's a 'Tower' of sorts, and it costs a lot to get into it I believe, but our main character got either teleported or isekai'd to a high floor of the tower, can't remember exactly, just know he's gotten there completely by accident.


Our main character ends up stuck in a cave or cavern but ends up gardening in there with the help of bees that end up being of the monster girl variety and clearly think very highly of him. Things are working out great, as far as being stuck in a cave goes.


I think that he was contacted at some point by some higher power within the system of the world to figure out how he ended up there?


Anything here ringing any bells for anyone? Google hates me and just keeps sending me to a manwa that's got a somewhat similar premise but it's definitely not the right thing.

Need helping finding a specific anime,Help,"Sorry if this is super vague, but all Ive got is my fuzzy ass memory on the matter with barely any leads.

Im trying to find a very specific anime that id forgotten the name to and the names to the characters. I cant shake the feeling that it's Devilman, but thats probably super wrong. Everytime I look something even remotely close to what im searching for, nothing of its likeness seems to ever come up.

Lets cut to the chase. There are three very distinct images I get in my head when I try to search my memories for this anime. The first is of a young adult, maybe im his 20s, that suffers from anger issues. He is dark-skinned and has a pretty striking similarity to Akira from Devilman. He's got the ability to transform into a demon or devil like monster each time he is enraged and loses control. He recall a fight scene of him and his childhood from fighting to the death on a rooftop of a building somewhere in the slums. The friend has white hair, is pale skinned and uses a mobile humanoid mech suit to fight.

The second image I have in my mind is of the devil man in a ruined building, close to death from a different fight with his mech friend after trying to save a girl. The mech suit friend has this sort of righteous personality where he believes himself the savior from this devil man. So he is ok with sacrificing one life for many, whilst the devil man is not and is also in love with this girl.

The last image which is also my strongest:

The devilman is a young boy, light skinned, long ungroomed hair, as if homeless. He is walking in a park, enranged and hunting a frog face demon that is disguised as a man. This frog face demon uaed his tongue as a weapon to hunt humans and i think the boys mother was one of the victims. The frog face demon has a blade at the tip of his tongue. When the boy finds him, he beats the shit out of him in a pretty badass way.


This is all I can remember and no matter how much I search, I cannot find it but it sits so strongly in my mind to be all in my head.

Please someone help, im going insane with this.",False,anime,1706060228.0,19e56a3

Favorite moments in anime where the protagonist went from a blockhead to genius,Discussion,"I don’t know why, but for some reason I felt like discussing a trope in anime that fascinates me, and it’s the moment where a protagonist that didn’t seem to be very bright was shown doing very amazing, such as finding the enemy’s weakness.




Like I don’t know if Chainsaw Man himself would fall under the trope as at first, he just looks like the kind of guy that just wants to score with babes, but then as the series goes on, he is shown to be a very competent fighter in battle as he can somehow wield 3 enormous chainsaws without impaling himself.



Yeah Denji may look like a total pushover at first, but again when it comes to battle, he knows how to survive as he is one of the few that can save the world from being consumed by demons.",False,anime,1706055463.0,19e3huw

I feel like Im forever just going to be watching Hayao Miyazaki movies and the old samurai movies, then people ask what other anime do you like and that’s when I throw them for a loop and tell them I hate pretty much every anime I’ve ever watched and that I just like old Japanese culture. I forgot One Punch Man I actually really liked, it’s funny I guess.

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
Unboxiois finally made it!! He has a fun story about the hidden 7 black presidents which leads me to asking, which ones!? XD 
>I met a guy IRL once who was convinced that ancient Egypt didn't exist and that the US had 7 black presidents who were president before George Washington. That's more of a conspiracy theory than a rumor, but these things aren't so different, are they?


Zadcap made an aspiring comment yesterday about how despite the Clamp girls being genuine degenerates who should be behind bars, that they kinda have a point. 
> The worse part is, as a young and impressionable child, CCS was a gateway into the rest of CLAMP as much as it was the start of my eternal Mahou Shoujo love. There was not a single forbidden romance those ladies didn't try to put on paper, and I read more taboo love stories than I can remember before I learned about the ideas of them being a taboo in the first place. So I grew up to know, as long as it's safe and consensual, then there's really nothing wrong with it just let love be love. -says someone who is going to die single lol

>That's not the [right prompt](https://i.imgur.com/jLs1VgR.png). Look at that [=w=](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyugfHPOFBE) homewrecker. The way the eye looks like a sunset, like someone's soul is sinking in flames. Listen. I'm not here to be some insistent LainxAlice shipper. Alice at least has, um, other interests? But they had something, right? lluNhpelA was just talking about it. You can absolutely how people could see it that way, especially once you get the idea of what it is that Alice has been trying to downplay and trust her friend about. And there's unpraiseworthy Lain, intruding from the corner with the face of a thousand memes. This scene has to be what it is to establish ideas about Lain and Alice's relationship, to put something under a cup so that when the carnie spins it around, you feel liike you know where it's gone. Yeah, she has a nice cat-got-the-cream look later, the classic ""my life now, Lain of the bedroom, enjoy the metaphorical-metaphysical cuck chair"" expression. But I can't help but sympathise. Poor Lain of the Other Side! Our girl had a bear onesie AND a best friend. Our other girl had... what? The head may not say it, but the heart knows that this episode is for the sake of LOVE.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      




Quiddy pog! 

> We'll see if I change my mind with what's left, but this has historically been my favorite episode of the show. An emotionally charged episode with the Alice - Lain stuff, the other Lain being quite over the top and some interesting imagery as well. Some good range from Bridget Hoffman in this episode playing two different versions of Lain. The whole concept of how one can be a totally different person online, one who can be totally unrestrained and become quite a horrible person I think has been a theme built up from earlier on, but really comes to a head here. Was Alice really having a relationship with that teacher? My position is no, she just fantasized about him. If anything I feel more strongly about it due to thematic stuff we get in the next episode. Which I'll have to wait until then to discuss.

Netflix and its horrible subtitles.,Discussion,"So like the title says, but what the hell is the deal with Netflix subtitles?

To gives a little bit of info, I primarily sail the seas to watch anime, Plex server, Sonarr etc etc well last night my plex wasnt working and i didnt feel like messing with it because it was late, i turned on Netflix on a friends account. I scrolled through and decided I will start watching My Happy Marriage, it was on my watchlist but never got around to it.

For starters, the show is great, im only on episode 8 but such a great show.

The bad is the subtitling. Holy shit, im not sure what is worse, the terrible translations or the god awful timing on everything. The last time i really watched a netflix exclusive anime was Komi Cant Communicate, and i remember episode 1 of that was just horribly translated to the point where i waited for fan subs/encoders to fix it.

I went ahead and watched My Happy Marriage on my Plex and the corrected subtitles, and its noticeably different and better.

Since we're new to it I thought of starting with some Ecchi light stuff, I've read about Miru Tights, but it seems a bit too much to begin with. Maybe Saekano is a good option?

Also, feel free to recommend some more explicit content as well, since we're probably going to watch it later. Nothing crazy like tentacles or sci-fi stuff please. If it's funny and has a great story is a big plus.

My main issue with a sign of affection,Discussion,"Let me start things off by saying i actually like this anime and i like its representation of people who are deaf, i love the character designs, and i love the setting of the story in college rather than high school.

My main problem with this anime is that i dont see the connection between the main girl and main guy at all. She gets a crush on him and then just immediately decides shes in love with him after she barely just met him and she barely had any interactions with him. I know this is the message they are trying to push with you just fall in love and you can decide when you are in love but still it just doesn’t make sense.

In contrast the second guy seems to be much more caring. I know hes a tsundere but deep down he cares for her and learned sign language for her and wants her safety but i know hes going to lose which is making my interest in this anime drop every episode.

The main guy is so touchy like he literally touches her without her consent and gets close to her without even asking at all. In real life this would be classified as some weird behavior but in this anime its portrayed as normal because hes “hot”",False,anime,1706045077.0,19dzg0u

Anime with the most solid soundtracks in your opinion?,Discussion,"What are the shows with the overall best music? Not just one or two good OPs but also the EDs and OSTs? 

The anime that would fit perfectly into that criteria for me would be Kimi to Boku. None of the songs are what I would listen to usually but the entire soundtrack is god-tier for emotion and nostalgia. Literally not a single miss and it fits the feeling of fleeting youth of the anime so well. Especially the OSTs, I remember not being able to find those soundtracks until years after I actually watched the show 

Given is a close second too. A 1-season sorta-niche BL has no right to have a soundtrack this godly. Sets the standard for ANY music anime imo. I love Bocchi and Kongming too but they don't even come close to Given's soundtrack imo, any of the songs from Given has the potential to be a j-rock classic

It's been quite a few years since I've seen a battle-shounen but is it just me or does JJK seem particularly heavy with non-stop balls-to-the-wall fighting action? I like the overall plot pacing and the fights are fantastic.

I remember watching naruto, fairy tail etc and felt there was more daily life scenes and non-battle character interactions back then.

I love the characters in JJK but some on my favourite scenes are when they go shopping or when they do that random baseball match.

Help me find the title of this anime?,Help,"I saw this anime like 20+ years ago and cannot for the life of me figure out what it is, despite searching multiple times over the years. I only saw one episode and really want to watch the rest if I can figure out what it is...

For the main characters, there was a girl and a dude adventuring together. The guy is kind of silly and can turn into a badass looking dragon, but I think it may only be if he is in a lot of trouble/ very hurt. I don't remember much about the girl. 

In the episode, the two are captured and are taken into a palace where they are strung up on a cross and semi- tortured. In the palace, there is a princess who is very hardened and cold. Later in the episode, it is revealed that the princess had been brainwashed and the real king and queen had been murdered by the current fake king and queen (i think there was a fire?). I think the adventurers try to help the princess, but from my memory, it was a bittersweet ending, and the dude turned into a dragon, destroyed a bunch of stuff, but I think the princess ended up dying. In the end, the girl flew away in the back of the dragon. 

I remember the art style having a lot of red tones and the overall tone of the anime was more somber than light hearted.

No Game No Life missing soundtrack?,Help,"So in the episode 8 when Sora and Shiro meets Izuna and they scream the dam king crimson, there's a background music that I couldn't find it, even I look for the whole soundtrack disc, and I found One track named ""TETO"" but sadly is different.

Looking for a particular anime that I can't remember the name of,Help,"I feel like I remember watching at least some of it if not the entirety of the first season but it was a while ago. Let me try to break down some key points.


There's a 'Tower' of sorts, and it costs a lot to get into it I believe, but our main character got either teleported or isekai'd to a high floor of the tower, can't remember exactly, just know he's gotten there completely by accident.


Our main character ends up stuck in a cave or cavern but ends up gardening in there with the help of bees that end up being of the monster girl variety and clearly think very highly of him. Things are working out great, as far as being stuck in a cave goes.


I think that he was contacted at some point by some higher power within the system of the world to figure out how he ended up there?


Anything here ringing any bells for anyone? Google hates me and just keeps sending me to a manwa that's got a somewhat similar premise but it's definitely not the right thing. Or maybe it was all a fever dream, I dunno. Thanks in advance, will edit in the title if it gets found!",False,anime,1705994952.0,19diyeu

What's an anime that was forgotten once it ended but you wish had gotten more attention?,Discussion,"Imo BNA (Brand New Animal) really deserved more attention. The animation style and use of color is so outstanding, the story was cool and holds up, and it had a great OP and ED, but the second it ended people forgot it existed. 

Talentless Nana was also a great one that deserves more Attention. The premise is shocking and there's so many interesting twists where you think all may be lost but they just keep going.

He has a sword and he goes to this school that ranks them into how powerful they are and at first he's the lowest.

Need helping finding a specific anime,Help,"Sorry if this is super vague, but all Ive got is my fuzzy ass memory on the matter with barely any leads.

Im trying to find a very specific anime that id forgotten the name to and the names to the characters. I cant shake the feeling that it's Devilman, but thats probably super wrong. Everytime I look something even remotely close to what im searching for, nothing of its likeness seems to ever come up.

Lets cut to the chase. There are three very distinct images I get in my head when I try to search my memories for this anime. The first is of a young adult, maybe im his 20s, that suffers from anger issues. He is dark-skinned and has a pretty striking similarity to Akira from Devilman. He's got the ability to transform into a demon or devil like monster each time he is enraged and loses control. He recall a fight scene of him and his childhood from fighting to the death on a rooftop of a building somewhere in the slums. The friend has white hair, is pale skinned and uses a mobile humanoid mech suit to fight.

The second image I have in my mind is of the devil man in a ruined building, close to death from a different fight with his mech friend after trying to save a girl. The mech suit friend has this sort of righteous personality where he believes himself the savior from this devil man. So he is ok with sacrificing one life for many, whilst the devil man is not and is also in love with this girl.

The last image which is also my strongest:

The devilman is a young boy, light skinned, long ungroomed hair, as if homeless. He is walking in a park, enranged and hunting a frog face demon that is disguised as a man. This frog face demon uaed his tongue as a weapon to hunt humans and i think the boys mother was one of the victims. The frog face demon has a blade at the tip of his tongue. When the boy finds him, he beats the shit out of him in a pretty badass way.


This is all I can remember and no matter how much I search, I cannot find it but it sits so strongly in my mind to be all in my head.

Please someone help, im going insane with this.",False,anime,1706060228.0,19e56a3

Favorite moments in anime where the protagonist went from a blockhead to genius,Discussion,"I don’t know why, but for some reason I felt like discussing a trope in anime that fascinates me, and it’s the moment where a protagonist that didn’t seem to be very bright was shown doing very amazing, such as finding the enemy’s weakness.




Like I don’t know if Chainsaw Man himself would fall under the trope as at first, he just looks like the kind of guy that just wants to score with babes, but then as the series goes on, he is shown to be a very competent fighter in battle as he can somehow wield 3 enormous chainsaws without impaling himself.

Cowboy bebop was a no, One Piece made me want to gouge my eyes out, Bleach I actually kinda like, Shokugeki no Soma i want to like because i love cooking but I can’t get past the cringey fanservice, Sword Art Online and Fairy Tale are trash, Attack on Titan has good animation and that’s it, Blue Exorcist and Tokyo revengers was great but not quite what im looking for, Hunter x Hunter was ok and still just not my thing, Chainsaw Man…seriously wtf, High School of the Dead…wtf, every isekai I’ve watched typically has way too much cringe and fan service. I feel like Im forever just going to be watching Hayao Miyazaki movies and the old samurai movies, then people ask what other anime do you like and that’s when I throw them for a loop and tell them I hate pretty much every anime I’ve ever watched and that I just like old Japanese culture. I forgot One Punch Man I actually really liked, it’s funny I guess.

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
Unboxiois finally made it!! He has a fun story about the hidden 7 black presidents which leads me to asking, which ones!? XD 
>I met a guy IRL once who was convinced that ancient Egypt didn't exist and that the US had 7 black presidents who were president before George Washington. That's more of a conspiracy theory than a rumor, but these things aren't so different, are they?


Zadcap made an aspiring comment yesterday about how despite the Clamp girls being genuine degenerates who should be behind bars, that they kinda have a point. 
> The worse part is, as a young and impressionable child, CCS was a gateway into the rest of CLAMP as much as it was the start of my eternal Mahou Shoujo love. There was not a single forbidden romance those ladies didn't try to put on paper, and I read more taboo love stories than I can remember before I learned about the ideas of them being a taboo in the first place. So I grew up to know, as long as it's safe and consensual, then there's really nothing wrong with it just let love be love. -says someone who is going to die single lol

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!"" 


DegenerateRegime fights in the name of LOVE! 

>That's not the [right prompt](https://i.imgur.com/jLs1VgR.png). Look at that [=w=](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyugfHPOFBE) homewrecker. The way the eye looks like a sunset, like someone's soul is sinking in flames. Listen. I'm not here to be some insistent LainxAlice shipper. Alice at least has, um, other interests? But they had something, right? lluNhpelA was just talking about it. You can absolutely how people could see it that way, especially once you get the idea of what it is that Alice has been trying to downplay and trust her friend about. And there's unpraiseworthy Lain, intruding from the corner with the face of a thousand memes. This scene has to be what it is to establish ideas about Lain and Alice's relationship, to put something under a cup so that when the carnie spins it around, you feel liike you know where it's gone. Yeah, she has a nice cat-got-the-cream look later, the classic ""my life now, Lain of the bedroom, enjoy the metaphorical-metaphysical cuck chair"" expression. But I can't help but sympathise. Poor Lain of the Other Side! Our girl had a bear onesie AND a best friend. Our other girl had... what? The head may not say it, but the heart knows that this episode is for the sake of LOVE.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      




Quiddy pog! 

> We'll see if I change my mind with what's left, but this has historically been my favorite episode of the show. An emotionally charged episode with the Alice - Lain stuff, the other Lain being quite over the top and some interesting imagery as well. Some good range from Bridget Hoffman in this episode playing two different versions of Lain. The whole concept of how one can be a totally different person online, one who can be totally unrestrained and become quite a horrible person I think has been a theme built up from earlier on, but really comes to a head here. Was Alice really having a relationship with that teacher? My position is no, she just fantasized about him. If anything I feel more strongly about it due to thematic stuff we get in the next episode. Which I'll have to wait until then to discuss.

Netflix and its horrible subtitles.,Discussion,"So like the title says, but what the hell is the deal with Netflix subtitles?

To gives a little bit of info, I primarily sail the seas to watch anime, Plex server, Sonarr etc etc well last night my plex wasnt working and i didnt feel like messing with it because it was late, i turned on Netflix on a friends account. I scrolled through and decided I will start watching My Happy Marriage, it was on my watchlist but never got around to it.

For starters, the show is great, im only on episode 8 but such a great show.

The bad is the subtitling. Holy shit, im not sure what is worse, the terrible translations or the god awful timing on everything. The last time i really watched a netflix exclusive anime was Komi Cant Communicate, and i remember episode 1 of that was just horribly translated to the point where i waited for fan subs/encoders to fix it.

I went ahead and watched My Happy Marriage on my Plex and the corrected subtitles, and its noticeably different and better.

Honestly I really want to watch Delicious In Dungeon but im thinking of just waiting it out because so far, netflix is 0 for 2 in terms of subtitling quality.",False,anime,1706045438.0,19dzlcb
LF Recommendation: Ecchi/Hentai/Nylon for couple new to it,What to Watch?,"As the title says, recently my GF got into hentai. So she asked me to look for some good high-quality erotic/romantic content that we can both watch and enjoy it together. 

If it helps, we're both really into nylon, pantyhose, tights and this kind of stuff, so we would appreciate something around it.

Since we're new to it I thought of starting with some Ecchi light stuff, I've read about Miru Tights, but it seems a bit too much to begin with. Maybe Saekano is a good option?

Also, feel free to recommend some more explicit content as well, since we're probably going to watch it later. Nothing crazy like tentacles or sci-fi stuff please. If it's funny and has a great story is a big plus.

My main issue with a sign of affection,Discussion,"Let me start things off by saying i actually like this anime and i like its representation of people who are deaf, i love the character designs, and i love the setting of the story in college rather than high school.

My main problem with this anime is that i dont see the connection between the main girl and main guy at all. She gets a crush on him and then just immediately decides shes in love with him after she barely just met him and she barely had any interactions with him. I know this is the message they are trying to push with you just fall in love and you can decide when you are in love but still it just doesn’t make sense.

In contrast the second guy seems to be much more caring. I know hes a tsundere but deep down he cares for her and learned sign language for her and wants her safety but i know hes going to lose which is making my interest in this anime drop every episode.

The main guy is so touchy like he literally touches her without her consent and gets close to her without even asking at all. In real life this would be classified as some weird behavior but in this anime its portrayed as normal because hes “hot”",False,anime,1706045077.0,19dzg0u

Anime with the most solid soundtracks in your opinion?,Discussion,"What are the shows with the overall best music? Not just one or two good OPs but also the EDs and OSTs?

Literally not a single miss and it fits the feeling of fleeting youth of the anime so well. Especially the OSTs, I remember not being able to find those soundtracks until years after I actually watched the show 

Given is a close second too. A 1-season sorta-niche BL has no right to have a soundtrack this godly. Sets the standard for ANY music anime imo. I love Bocchi and Kongming too but they don't even come close to Given's soundtrack imo, any of the songs from Given has the potential to be a j-rock classic

It's been quite a few years since I've seen a battle-shounen but is it just me or does JJK seem particularly heavy with non-stop balls-to-the-wall fighting action? I like the overall plot pacing and the fights are fantastic.

I remember watching naruto, fairy tail etc and felt there was more daily life scenes and non-battle character interactions back then.

I love the characters in JJK but some on my favourite scenes are when they go shopping or when they do that random baseball match.

Help me find the title of this anime?,Help,"I saw this anime like 20+ years ago and cannot for the life of me figure out what it is, despite searching multiple times over the years. I only saw one episode and really want to watch the rest if I can figure out what it is...

For the main characters, there was a girl and a dude adventuring together. The guy is kind of silly and can turn into a badass looking dragon, but I think it may only be if he is in a lot of trouble/ very hurt. I don't remember much about the girl. 

In the episode, the two are captured and are taken into a palace where they are strung up on a cross and semi- tortured. In the palace, there is a princess who is very hardened and cold. Later in the episode, it is revealed that the princess had been brainwashed and the real king and queen had been murdered by the current fake king and queen (i think there was a fire?). I think the adventurers try to help the princess, but from my memory, it was a bittersweet ending, and the dude turned into a dragon, destroyed a bunch of stuff, but I think the princess ended up dying. In the end, the girl flew away in the back of the dragon. 

I remember the art style having a lot of red tones and the overall tone of the anime was more somber than light hearted.

Can someone tell me these anime's titles?,Help,"I saw them on instagram and now I can't find them

So, the first one is, students are in some kind of stadium, they shoot at targets using magic and the mc is so strong he shoots a hole in the ground and destroys all the targets

The other one is, the mc doesn't want others to know how strong he is so he hides his powers, they try to teach him how to use magic but because he hides his real powers everyone thinks he's weak, I remember a scene when a girl tries to teach him how to walk on water but he can't and when the girl leaves he stands up (still on the water) and tells how tiring it is to hide his powers",False,anime,1706004773.0,19dl7xz

Looking for a particular anime that I can't remember the name of,Help,"I feel like I remember watching at least some of it if not the entirety of the first season but it was a while ago. Let me try to break down some key points.


There's a 'Tower' of sorts, and it costs a lot to get into it I believe, but our main character got either teleported or isekai'd to a high floor of the tower, can't remember exactly, just know he's gotten there completely by accident.


Our main character ends up stuck in a cave or cavern but ends up gardening in there with the help of bees that end up being of the monster girl variety and clearly think very highly of him. Things are working out great, as far as being stuck in a cave goes.


I think that he was contacted at some point by some higher power within the system of the world to figure out how he ended up there?


Anything here ringing any bells for anyone? Google hates me and just keeps sending me to a manwa that's got a somewhat similar premise but it's definitely not the right thing.

Need helping finding a specific anime,Help,"Sorry if this is super vague, but all Ive got is my fuzzy ass memory on the matter with barely any leads.

Im trying to find a very specific anime that id forgotten the name to and the names to the characters. I cant shake the feeling that it's Devilman, but thats probably super wrong. Everytime I look something even remotely close to what im searching for, nothing of its likeness seems to ever come up.

Lets cut to the chase. There are three very distinct images I get in my head when I try to search my memories for this anime. The first is of a young adult, maybe im his 20s, that suffers from anger issues. He is dark-skinned and has a pretty striking similarity to Akira from Devilman. He's got the ability to transform into a demon or devil like monster each time he is enraged and loses control. He recall a fight scene of him and his childhood from fighting to the death on a rooftop of a building somewhere in the slums. The friend has white hair, is pale skinned and uses a mobile humanoid mech suit to fight.

The second image I have in my mind is of the devil man in a ruined building, close to death from a different fight with his mech friend after trying to save a girl. The mech suit friend has this sort of righteous personality where he believes himself the savior from this devil man. So he is ok with sacrificing one life for many, whilst the devil man is not and is also in love with this girl.

The last image which is also my strongest:

The devilman is a young boy, light skinned, long ungroomed hair, as if homeless. He is walking in a park, enranged and hunting a frog face demon that is disguised as a man. This frog face demon uaed his tongue as a weapon to hunt humans and i think the boys mother was one of the victims. The frog face demon has a blade at the tip of his tongue. When the boy finds him, he beats the shit out of him in a pretty badass way.


This is all I can remember and no matter how much I search, I cannot find it but it sits so strongly in my mind to be all in my head.

Like I don’t know if Chainsaw Man himself would fall under the trope as at first, he just looks like the kind of guy that just wants to score with babes, but then as the series goes on, he is shown to be a very competent fighter in battle as he can somehow wield 3 enormous chainsaws without impaling himself.

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
Unboxiois finally made it!! He has a fun story about the hidden 7 black presidents which leads me to asking, which ones!? XD 
>I met a guy IRL once who was convinced that ancient Egypt didn't exist and that the US had 7 black presidents who were president before George Washington. That's more of a conspiracy theory than a rumor, but these things aren't so different, are they?


Zadcap made an aspiring comment yesterday about how despite the Clamp girls being genuine degenerates who should be behind bars, that they kinda have a point. 
> The worse part is, as a young and impressionable child, CCS was a gateway into the rest of CLAMP as much as it was the start of my eternal Mahou Shoujo love. There was not a single forbidden romance those ladies didn't try to put on paper, and I read more taboo love stories than I can remember before I learned about the ideas of them being a taboo in the first place. So I grew up to know, as long as it's safe and consensual, then there's really nothing wrong with it just let love be love. -says someone who is going to die single lol

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!"" 


DegenerateRegime fights in the name of LOVE! 

>That's not the [right prompt](https://i.imgur.com/jLs1VgR.png). Look at that [=w=](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyugfHPOFBE) homewrecker. The way the eye looks like a sunset, like someone's soul is sinking in flames. Listen. I'm not here to be some insistent LainxAlice shipper. Alice at least has, um, other interests? But they had something, right? lluNhpelA was just talking about it. You can absolutely how people could see it that way, especially once you get the idea of what it is that Alice has been trying to downplay and trust her friend about. And there's unpraiseworthy Lain, intruding from the corner with the face of a thousand memes. This scene has to be what it is to establish ideas about Lain and Alice's relationship, to put something under a cup so that when the carnie spins it around, you feel liike you know where it's gone. Yeah, she has a nice cat-got-the-cream look later, the classic ""my life now, Lain of the bedroom, enjoy the metaphorical-metaphysical cuck chair"" expression. But I can't help but sympathise. Poor Lain of the Other Side! Our girl had a bear onesie AND a best friend. Our other girl had... what? The head may not say it, but the heart knows that this episode is for the sake of LOVE.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      




Quiddy pog! 

> We'll see if I change my mind with what's left, but this has historically been my favorite episode of the show. An emotionally charged episode with the Alice - Lain stuff, the other Lain being quite over the top and some interesting imagery as well. Some good range from Bridget Hoffman in this episode playing two different versions of Lain. The whole concept of how one can be a totally different person online, one who can be totally unrestrained and become quite a horrible person I think has been a theme built up from earlier on, but really comes to a head here. Was Alice really having a relationship with that teacher? My position is no, she just fantasized about him. If anything I feel more strongly about it due to thematic stuff we get in the next episode. Which I'll have to wait until then to discuss.

Netflix and its horrible subtitles.,Discussion,"So like the title says, but what the hell is the deal with Netflix subtitles?

To gives a little bit of info, I primarily sail the seas to watch anime, Plex server, Sonarr etc etc well last night my plex wasnt working and i didnt feel like messing with it because it was late, i turned on Netflix on a friends account. I scrolled through and decided I will start watching My Happy Marriage, it was on my watchlist but never got around to it.

For starters, the show is great, im only on episode 8 but such a great show.

The bad is the subtitling. Holy shit, im not sure what is worse, the terrible translations or the god awful timing on everything. The last time i really watched a netflix exclusive anime was Komi Cant Communicate, and i remember episode 1 of that was just horribly translated to the point where i waited for fan subs/encoders to fix it.

I went ahead and watched My Happy Marriage on my Plex and the corrected subtitles, and its noticeably different and better.

Honestly I really want to watch Delicious In Dungeon but im thinking of just waiting it out because so far, netflix is 0 for 2 in terms of subtitling quality.",False,anime,1706045438.0,19dzlcb

Since we're new to it I thought of starting with some Ecchi light stuff, I've read about Miru Tights, but it seems a bit too much to begin with. Maybe Saekano is a good option?

Also, feel free to recommend some more explicit content as well, since we're probably going to watch it later. Nothing crazy like tentacles or sci-fi stuff please. If it's funny and has a great story is a big plus.

My main issue with a sign of affection,Discussion,"Let me start things off by saying i actually like this anime and i like its representation of people who are deaf, i love the character designs, and i love the setting of the story in college rather than high school.

My main problem with this anime is that i dont see the connection between the main girl and main guy at all. She gets a crush on him and then just immediately decides shes in love with him after she barely just met him and she barely had any interactions with him. I know this is the message they are trying to push with you just fall in love and you can decide when you are in love but still it just doesn’t make sense.

In contrast the second guy seems to be much more caring. I know hes a tsundere but deep down he cares for her and learned sign language for her and wants her safety but i know hes going to lose which is making my interest in this anime drop every episode.

The main guy is so touchy like he literally touches her without her consent and gets close to her without even asking at all. In real life this would be classified as some weird behavior but in this anime its portrayed as normal because hes “hot”",False,anime,1706045077.0,19dzg0u

Help remembering some anime,Help,"Im sorry for the lack of info, this is a anime i watched at least two years ago and me and my fiance are trying to recall what it was. 

This girl (girl 1)  and man are obsessed with some online mmo. The man has no money, so hes been staying in overnight cubicles in japan with computers to play the game. Eventually he loses all his money to even do that- one of the girls (girl 2) who stays at the same place in the snack room offered her stall for him to stay in. That girl (girl 2) plays the game with him, and she tells him if he loves the other girl (girl 1) he needs to go talk to her.

Anime with the most solid soundtracks in your opinion?,Discussion,"What are the shows with the overall best music? Not just one or two good OPs but also the EDs and OSTs? 

The anime that would fit perfectly into that criteria for me would be Kimi to Boku. None of the songs are what I would listen to usually but the entire soundtrack is god-tier for emotion and nostalgia. Literally not a single miss and it fits the feeling of fleeting youth of the anime so well. Especially the OSTs, I remember not being able to find those soundtracks until years after I actually watched the show 

Given is a close second too. A 1-season sorta-niche BL has no right to have a soundtrack this godly. Sets the standard for ANY music anime imo. I love Bocchi and Kongming too but they don't even come close to Given's soundtrack imo, any of the songs from Given has the potential to be a j-rock classic

JJK - what to expect?,Help,"Not complaining, just trying to figure something out and get opinions because no one I know watches anime.

It's been quite a few years since I've seen a battle-shounen but is it just me or does JJK seem particularly heavy with non-stop balls-to-the-wall fighting action? I like the overall plot pacing and the fights are fantastic.

I remember watching naruto, fairy tail etc and felt there was more daily life scenes and non-battle character interactions back then.

I love the characters in JJK but some on my favourite scenes are when they go shopping or when they do that random baseball match.

 I just get tired after watching more than 2 or 3 episodes from all the back-to-back fights lol. Did I just get older and can't handle the adrenaline now?  Is that manga any different?",False,anime,1706005320.0,19dlcmy
Help me find the title of this anime?,Help,"I saw this anime like 20+ years ago and cannot for the life of me figure out what it is, despite searching multiple times over the years. I only saw one episode and really want to watch the rest if I can figure out what it is...

For the main characters, there was a girl and a dude adventuring together. The guy is kind of silly and can turn into a badass looking dragon, but I think it may only be if he is in a lot of trouble/ very hurt. I don't remember much about the girl. 

In the episode, the two are captured and are taken into a palace where they are strung up on a cross and semi- tortured. In the palace, there is a princess who is very hardened and cold. Later in the episode, it is revealed that the princess had been brainwashed and the real king and queen had been murdered by the current fake king and queen (i think there was a fire?). I think the adventurers try to help the princess, but from my memory, it was a bittersweet ending, and the dude turned into a dragon, destroyed a bunch of stuff, but I think the princess ended up dying. In the end, the girl flew away in the back of the dragon. 

I remember the art style having a lot of red tones and the overall tone of the anime was more somber than light hearted.

Please help me solve this mystery!
Thanks so much in advance, everyone!",False,anime,1706004976.0,19dl9nk

Looking for a particular anime that I can't remember the name of,Help,"I feel like I remember watching at least some of it if not the entirety of the first season but it was a while ago. Let me try to break down some key points.


There's a 'Tower' of sorts, and it costs a lot to get into it I believe, but our main character got either teleported or isekai'd to a high floor of the tower, can't remember exactly, just know he's gotten there completely by accident.


Our main character ends up stuck in a cave or cavern but ends up gardening in there with the help of bees that end up being of the monster girl variety and clearly think very highly of him. Things are working out great, as far as being stuck in a cave goes.


I think that he was contacted at some point by some higher power within the system of the world to figure out how he ended up there?


Anything here ringing any bells for anyone? Google hates me and just keeps sending me to a manwa that's got a somewhat similar premise but it's definitely not the right thing.

Need helping finding a specific anime,Help,"Sorry if this is super vague, but all Ive got is my fuzzy ass memory on the matter with barely any leads.

Im trying to find a very specific anime that id forgotten the name to and the names to the characters. I cant shake the feeling that it's Devilman, but thats probably super wrong. Everytime I look something even remotely close to what im searching for, nothing of its likeness seems to ever come up.

Lets cut to the chase. There are three very distinct images I get in my head when I try to search my memories for this anime. The first is of a young adult, maybe im his 20s, that suffers from anger issues. He is dark-skinned and has a pretty striking similarity to Akira from Devilman. He's got the ability to transform into a demon or devil like monster each time he is enraged and loses control. He recall a fight scene of him and his childhood from fighting to the death on a rooftop of a building somewhere in the slums. The friend has white hair, is pale skinned and uses a mobile humanoid mech suit to fight.

The second image I have in my mind is of the devil man in a ruined building, close to death from a different fight with his mech friend after trying to save a girl. The mech suit friend has this sort of righteous personality where he believes himself the savior from this devil man. So he is ok with sacrificing one life for many, whilst the devil man is not and is also in love with this girl.

The last image which is also my strongest:

The devilman is a young boy, light skinned, long ungroomed hair, as if homeless. He is walking in a park, enranged and hunting a frog face demon that is disguised as a man. This frog face demon uaed his tongue as a weapon to hunt humans and i think the boys mother was one of the victims. The frog face demon has a blade at the tip of his tongue. When the boy finds him, he beats the shit out of him in a pretty badass way.


This is all I can remember and no matter how much I search, I cannot find it but it sits so strongly in my mind to be all in my head.

Like I don’t know if Chainsaw Man himself would fall under the trope as at first, he just looks like the kind of guy that just wants to score with babes, but then as the series goes on, he is shown to be a very competent fighter in battle as he can somehow wield 3 enormous chainsaws without impaling himself.

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
Unboxiois finally made it!! He has a fun story about the hidden 7 black presidents which leads me to asking, which ones!? XD 
>I met a guy IRL once who was convinced that ancient Egypt didn't exist and that the US had 7 black presidents who were president before George Washington. That's more of a conspiracy theory than a rumor, but these things aren't so different, are they?


Zadcap made an aspiring comment yesterday about how despite the Clamp girls being genuine degenerates who should be behind bars, that they kinda have a point. 
> The worse part is, as a young and impressionable child, CCS was a gateway into the rest of CLAMP as much as it was the start of my eternal Mahou Shoujo love. There was not a single forbidden romance those ladies didn't try to put on paper, and I read more taboo love stories than I can remember before I learned about the ideas of them being a taboo in the first place. So I grew up to know, as long as it's safe and consensual, then there's really nothing wrong with it just let love be love. -says someone who is going to die single lol

The way the eye looks like a sunset, like someone's soul is sinking in flames. Listen. I'm not here to be some insistent LainxAlice shipper. Alice at least has, um, other interests? But they had something, right? lluNhpelA was just talking about it. You can absolutely how people could see it that way, especially once you get the idea of what it is that Alice has been trying to downplay and trust her friend about. And there's unpraiseworthy Lain, intruding from the corner with the face of a thousand memes. This scene has to be what it is to establish ideas about Lain and Alice's relationship, to put something under a cup so that when the carnie spins it around, you feel liike you know where it's gone. Yeah, she has a nice cat-got-the-cream look later, the classic ""my life now, Lain of the bedroom, enjoy the metaphorical-metaphysical cuck chair"" expression. But I can't help but sympathise. Poor Lain of the Other Side! Our girl had a bear onesie AND a best friend. Our other girl had... what? The head may not say it, but the heart knows that this episode is for the sake of LOVE.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      




Quiddy pog! 

> We'll see if I change my mind with what's left, but this has historically been my favorite episode of the show. An emotionally charged episode with the Alice - Lain stuff, the other Lain being quite over the top and some interesting imagery as well. Some good range from Bridget Hoffman in this episode playing two different versions of Lain. The whole concept of how one can be a totally different person online, one who can be totally unrestrained and become quite a horrible person I think has been a theme built up from earlier on, but really comes to a head here. Was Alice really having a relationship with that teacher? My position is no, she just fantasized about him. If anything I feel more strongly about it due to thematic stuff we get in the next episode. Which I'll have to wait until then to discuss.

Netflix and its horrible subtitles.,Discussion,"So like the title says, but what the hell is the deal with Netflix subtitles?

To gives a little bit of info, I primarily sail the seas to watch anime, Plex server, Sonarr etc etc well last night my plex wasnt working and i didnt feel like messing with it because it was late, i turned on Netflix on a friends account. I scrolled through and decided I will start watching My Happy Marriage, it was on my watchlist but never got around to it.

For starters, the show is great, im only on episode 8 but such a great show.

The bad is the subtitling. Holy shit, im not sure what is worse, the terrible translations or the god awful timing on everything. The last time i really watched a netflix exclusive anime was Komi Cant Communicate, and i remember episode 1 of that was just horribly translated to the point where i waited for fan subs/encoders to fix it.

I went ahead and watched My Happy Marriage on my Plex and the corrected subtitles, and its noticeably different and better.

Since we're new to it I thought of starting with some Ecchi light stuff, I've read about Miru Tights, but it seems a bit too much to begin with. Maybe Saekano is a good option?

Also, feel free to recommend some more explicit content as well, since we're probably going to watch it later. Nothing crazy like tentacles or sci-fi stuff please. If it's funny and has a great story is a big plus.

My main issue with a sign of affection,Discussion,"Let me start things off by saying i actually like this anime and i like its representation of people who are deaf, i love the character designs, and i love the setting of the story in college rather than high school.

My main problem with this anime is that i dont see the connection between the main girl and main guy at all. She gets a crush on him and then just immediately decides shes in love with him after she barely just met him and she barely had any interactions with him. I know this is the message they are trying to push with you just fall in love and you can decide when you are in love but still it just doesn’t make sense.

In contrast the second guy seems to be much more caring. I know hes a tsundere but deep down he cares for her and learned sign language for her and wants her safety but i know hes going to lose which is making my interest in this anime drop every episode.

The main guy is so touchy like he literally touches her without her consent and gets close to her without even asking at all. In real life this would be classified as some weird behavior but in this anime its portrayed as normal because hes “hot”",False,anime,1706045077.0,19dzg0u

Anime with the most solid soundtracks in your opinion?,Discussion,"What are the shows with the overall best music? Not just one or two good OPs but also the EDs and OSTs? 

The anime that would fit perfectly into that criteria for me would be Kimi to Boku. None of the songs are what I would listen to usually but the entire soundtrack is god-tier for emotion and nostalgia. Literally not a single miss and it fits the feeling of fleeting youth of the anime so well. Especially the OSTs, I remember not being able to find those soundtracks until years after I actually watched the show 

Given is a close second too. A 1-season sorta-niche BL has no right to have a soundtrack this godly. Sets the standard for ANY music anime imo. I love Bocchi and Kongming too but they don't even come close to Given's soundtrack imo, any of the songs from Given has the potential to be a j-rock classic

It's been quite a few years since I've seen a battle-shounen but is it just me or does JJK seem particularly heavy with non-stop balls-to-the-wall fighting action? I like the overall plot pacing and the fights are fantastic.

I remember watching naruto, fairy tail etc and felt there was more daily life scenes and non-battle character interactions back then.

I love the characters in JJK but some on my favourite scenes are when they go shopping or when they do that random baseball match.

Help me find the title of this anime?,Help,"I saw this anime like 20+ years ago and cannot for the life of me figure out what it is, despite searching multiple times over the years. I only saw one episode and really want to watch the rest if I can figure out what it is...

For the main characters, there was a girl and a dude adventuring together. The guy is kind of silly and can turn into a badass looking dragon, but I think it may only be if he is in a lot of trouble/ very hurt. I don't remember much about the girl. 

In the episode, the two are captured and are taken into a palace where they are strung up on a cross and semi- tortured. In the palace, there is a princess who is very hardened and cold. Later in the episode, it is revealed that the princess had been brainwashed and the real king and queen had been murdered by the current fake king and queen (i think there was a fire?). I think the adventurers try to help the princess, but from my memory, it was a bittersweet ending, and the dude turned into a dragon, destroyed a bunch of stuff, but I think the princess ended up dying. In the end, the girl flew away in the back of the dragon. 

I remember the art style having a lot of red tones and the overall tone of the anime was more somber than light hearted.

No Game No Life missing soundtrack?,Help,"So in the episode 8 when Sora and Shiro meets Izuna and they scream the dam king crimson, there's a background music that I couldn't find it, even I look for the whole soundtrack disc, and I found One track named ""TETO"" but sadly is different.

Looking for a particular anime that I can't remember the name of,Help,"I feel like I remember watching at least some of it if not the entirety of the first season but it was a while ago. Let me try to break down some key points.


There's a 'Tower' of sorts, and it costs a lot to get into it I believe, but our main character got either teleported or isekai'd to a high floor of the tower, can't remember exactly, just know he's gotten there completely by accident.


Our main character ends up stuck in a cave or cavern but ends up gardening in there with the help of bees that end up being of the monster girl variety and clearly think very highly of him. Things are working out great, as far as being stuck in a cave goes.


I think that he was contacted at some point by some higher power within the system of the world to figure out how he ended up there?


Anything here ringing any bells for anyone? Google hates me and just keeps sending me to a manwa that's got a somewhat similar premise but it's definitely not the right thing. Or maybe it was all a fever dream, I dunno. Thanks in advance, will edit in the title if it gets found!",False,anime,1705994952.0,19diyeu

What's an anime that was forgotten once it ended but you wish had gotten more attention?,Discussion,"Imo BNA (Brand New Animal) really deserved more attention. The animation style and use of color is so outstanding, the story was cool and holds up, and it had a great OP and ED, but the second it ended people forgot it existed. 

Talentless Nana was also a great one that deserves more Attention. The premise is shocking and there's so many interesting twists where you think all may be lost but they just keep going.

He has a sword and he goes to this school that ranks them into how powerful they are and at first he's the lowest.

Need helping finding a specific anime,Help,"Sorry if this is super vague, but all Ive got is my fuzzy ass memory on the matter with barely any leads.

Im trying to find a very specific anime that id forgotten the name to and the names to the characters. I cant shake the feeling that it's Devilman, but thats probably super wrong. Everytime I look something even remotely close to what im searching for, nothing of its likeness seems to ever come up.

Lets cut to the chase. There are three very distinct images I get in my head when I try to search my memories for this anime. The first is of a young adult, maybe im his 20s, that suffers from anger issues. He is dark-skinned and has a pretty striking similarity to Akira from Devilman. He's got the ability to transform into a demon or devil like monster each time he is enraged and loses control. He recall a fight scene of him and his childhood from fighting to the death on a rooftop of a building somewhere in the slums. The friend has white hair, is pale skinned and uses a mobile humanoid mech suit to fight.

The second image I have in my mind is of the devil man in a ruined building, close to death from a different fight with his mech friend after trying to save a girl. The mech suit friend has this sort of righteous personality where he believes himself the savior from this devil man. So he is ok with sacrificing one life for many, whilst the devil man is not and is also in love with this girl.

The last image which is also my strongest:

The devilman is a young boy, light skinned, long ungroomed hair, as if homeless. He is walking in a park, enranged and hunting a frog face demon that is disguised as a man. This frog face demon uaed his tongue as a weapon to hunt humans and i think the boys mother was one of the victims. The frog face demon has a blade at the tip of his tongue. When the boy finds him, he beats the shit out of him in a pretty badass way.


This is all I can remember and no matter how much I search, I cannot find it but it sits so strongly in my mind to be all in my head.

Please someone help, im going insane with this.",False,anime,1706060228.0,19e56a3

Favorite moments in anime where the protagonist went from a blockhead to genius,Discussion,"I don’t know why, but for some reason I felt like discussing a trope in anime that fascinates me, and it’s the moment where a protagonist that didn’t seem to be very bright was shown doing very amazing, such as finding the enemy’s weakness.




Like I don’t know if Chainsaw Man himself would fall under the trope as at first, he just looks like the kind of guy that just wants to score with babes, but then as the series goes on, he is shown to be a very competent fighter in battle as he can somehow wield 3 enormous chainsaws without impaling himself.

Cowboy bebop was a no, One Piece made me want to gouge my eyes out, Bleach I actually kinda like, Shokugeki no Soma i want to like because i love cooking but I can’t get past the cringey fanservice, Sword Art Online and Fairy Tale are trash, Attack on Titan has good animation and that’s it, Blue Exorcist and Tokyo revengers was great but not quite what im looking for, Hunter x Hunter was ok and still just not my thing, Chainsaw Man…seriously wtf, High School of the Dead…wtf, every isekai I’ve watched typically has way too much cringe and fan service. I feel like Im forever just going to be watching Hayao Miyazaki movies and the old samurai movies, then people ask what other anime do you like and that’s when I throw them for a loop and tell them I hate pretty much every anime I’ve ever watched and that I just like old Japanese culture. I forgot One Punch Man I actually really liked, it’s funny I guess.

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
Unboxiois finally made it!! He has a fun story about the hidden 7 black presidents which leads me to asking, which ones!? XD 
>I met a guy IRL once who was convinced that ancient Egypt didn't exist and that the US had 7 black presidents who were president before George Washington. That's more of a conspiracy theory than a rumor, but these things aren't so different, are they?


Zadcap made an aspiring comment yesterday about how despite the Clamp girls being genuine degenerates who should be behind bars, that they kinda have a point. 
> The worse part is, as a young and impressionable child, CCS was a gateway into the rest of CLAMP as much as it was the start of my eternal Mahou Shoujo love. There was not a single forbidden romance those ladies didn't try to put on paper, and I read more taboo love stories than I can remember before I learned about the ideas of them being a taboo in the first place. So I grew up to know, as long as it's safe and consensual, then there's really nothing wrong with it just let love be love. -says someone who is going to die single lol



SilkyStrawberryMilk totally pwned that dumb Lain of the Kusogaki!! You show her!!

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!"" 


DegenerateRegime fights in the name of LOVE! 

>That's not the [right prompt](https://i.imgur.com/jLs1VgR.png). Look at that [=w=](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyugfHPOFBE) homewrecker. The way the eye looks like a sunset, like someone's soul is sinking in flames. Listen. I'm not here to be some insistent LainxAlice shipper. Alice at least has, um, other interests? But they had something, right? lluNhpelA was just talking about it. You can absolutely how people could see it that way, especially once you get the idea of what it is that Alice has been trying to downplay and trust her friend about. And there's unpraiseworthy Lain, intruding from the corner with the face of a thousand memes. This scene has to be what it is to establish ideas about Lain and Alice's relationship, to put something under a cup so that when the carnie spins it around, you feel liike you know where it's gone. Yeah, she has a nice cat-got-the-cream look later, the classic ""my life now, Lain of the bedroom, enjoy the metaphorical-metaphysical cuck chair"" expression. But I can't help but sympathise. Poor Lain of the Other Side! Our girl had a bear onesie AND a best friend. Our other girl had... what? The head may not say it, but the heart knows that this episode is for the sake of LOVE.

An emotionally charged episode with the Alice - Lain stuff, the other Lain being quite over the top and some interesting imagery as well. Some good range from Bridget Hoffman in this episode playing two different versions of Lain. The whole concept of how one can be a totally different person online, one who can be totally unrestrained and become quite a horrible person I think has been a theme built up from earlier on, but really comes to a head here. Was Alice really having a relationship with that teacher? My position is no, she just fantasized about him. If anything I feel more strongly about it due to thematic stuff we get in the next episode. Which I'll have to wait until then to discuss.

Netflix and its horrible subtitles.,Discussion,"So like the title says, but what the hell is the deal with Netflix subtitles?

To gives a little bit of info, I primarily sail the seas to watch anime, Plex server, Sonarr etc etc well last night my plex wasnt working and i didnt feel like messing with it because it was late, i turned on Netflix on a friends account. I scrolled through and decided I will start watching My Happy Marriage, it was on my watchlist but never got around to it.

For starters, the show is great, im only on episode 8 but such a great show.

The bad is the subtitling. Holy shit, im not sure what is worse, the terrible translations or the god awful timing on everything. The last time i really watched a netflix exclusive anime was Komi Cant Communicate, and i remember episode 1 of that was just horribly translated to the point where i waited for fan subs/encoders to fix it.

I went ahead and watched My Happy Marriage on my Plex and the corrected subtitles, and its noticeably different and better.

Honestly I really want to watch Delicious In Dungeon but im thinking of just waiting it out because so far, netflix is 0 for 2 in terms of subtitling quality.",False,anime,1706045438.0,19dzlcb
LF Recommendation: Ecchi/Hentai/Nylon for couple new to it,What to Watch?,"As the title says, recently my GF got into hentai. So she asked me to look for some good high-quality erotic/romantic content that we can both watch and enjoy it together. 

If it helps, we're both really into nylon, pantyhose, tights and this kind of stuff, so we would appreciate something around it.

Since we're new to it I thought of starting with some Ecchi light stuff, I've read about Miru Tights, but it seems a bit too much to begin with. Maybe Saekano is a good option?

Also, feel free to recommend some more explicit content as well, since we're probably going to watch it later. Nothing crazy like tentacles or sci-fi stuff please. If it's funny and has a great story is a big plus.

My main issue with a sign of affection,Discussion,"Let me start things off by saying i actually like this anime and i like its representation of people who are deaf, i love the character designs, and i love the setting of the story in college rather than high school.

My main problem with this anime is that i dont see the connection between the main girl and main guy at all. She gets a crush on him and then just immediately decides shes in love with him after she barely just met him and she barely had any interactions with him. I know this is the message they are trying to push with you just fall in love and you can decide when you are in love but still it just doesn’t make sense.

In contrast the second guy seems to be much more caring. I know hes a tsundere but deep down he cares for her and learned sign language for her and wants her safety but i know hes going to lose which is making my interest in this anime drop every episode.

The main guy is so touchy like he literally touches her without her consent and gets close to her without even asking at all. In real life this would be classified as some weird behavior but in this anime its portrayed as normal because hes “hot”",False,anime,1706045077.0,19dzg0u

Anime with the most solid soundtracks in your opinion?,Discussion,"What are the shows with the overall best music? Not just one or two good OPs but also the EDs and OSTs?

Literally not a single miss and it fits the feeling of fleeting youth of the anime so well. Especially the OSTs, I remember not being able to find those soundtracks until years after I actually watched the show 

Given is a close second too. A 1-season sorta-niche BL has no right to have a soundtrack this godly. Sets the standard for ANY music anime imo. I love Bocchi and Kongming too but they don't even come close to Given's soundtrack imo, any of the songs from Given has the potential to be a j-rock classic

JJK - what to expect?,Help,"Not complaining, just trying to figure something out and get opinions because no one I know watches anime.

It's been quite a few years since I've seen a battle-shounen but is it just me or does JJK seem particularly heavy with non-stop balls-to-the-wall fighting action? I like the overall plot pacing and the fights are fantastic.

I remember watching naruto, fairy tail etc and felt there was more daily life scenes and non-battle character interactions back then.

I love the characters in JJK but some on my favourite scenes are when they go shopping or when they do that random baseball match.

Help me find the title of this anime?,Help,"I saw this anime like 20+ years ago and cannot for the life of me figure out what it is, despite searching multiple times over the years. I only saw one episode and really want to watch the rest if I can figure out what it is...

For the main characters, there was a girl and a dude adventuring together. The guy is kind of silly and can turn into a badass looking dragon, but I think it may only be if he is in a lot of trouble/ very hurt. I don't remember much about the girl. 

In the episode, the two are captured and are taken into a palace where they are strung up on a cross and semi- tortured. In the palace, there is a princess who is very hardened and cold. Later in the episode, it is revealed that the princess had been brainwashed and the real king and queen had been murdered by the current fake king and queen (i think there was a fire?). I think the adventurers try to help the princess, but from my memory, it was a bittersweet ending, and the dude turned into a dragon, destroyed a bunch of stuff, but I think the princess ended up dying. In the end, the girl flew away in the back of the dragon.

Can someone tell me these anime's titles?,Help,"I saw them on instagram and now I can't find them

So, the first one is, students are in some kind of stadium, they shoot at targets using magic and the mc is so strong he shoots a hole in the ground and destroys all the targets

The other one is, the mc doesn't want others to know how strong he is so he hides his powers, they try to teach him how to use magic but because he hides his real powers everyone thinks he's weak, I remember a scene when a girl tries to teach him how to walk on water but he can't and when the girl leaves he stands up (still on the water) and tells how tiring it is to hide his powers",False,anime,1706004773.0,19dl7xz

Does anyone know this anime?,Help,"I've been trying to remember this anime but I can't seem to figure it out. It's a fantasy anime, I believe it's isekai but I'm not sure, but the protagonist goes to magic academy and is really strong, but the school is based on social status, and he's given the lowest rank which was bronze or copper, I'm not sure. But that's all I remember, apologies if it's too vague

Edit: to maybe help with the vagueness, I did remember a little more. The student's status is displayed on their arm with the corresponding metal of their rank, like platinum, bronze, gold, etc. I also believe they were classified as different shapes that are their magic level, like a triangle, square, pentagon, etc",False,anime,1706000286.0,19dk68c

Solo Leveling is very motivational,Discussion,"I watched the episode 3 of Solo Leveling and for some reason I just wanted to go for a run and do some exercise. Recently my 9-5 everyday job has made me depressed, I wasn't getting up early for my usual morning jogging session. I avoided doing exercises just by telling myself that life's not good. But after watching that recent solo leveling episode, I set up my alarm that night and got up early and did some exercises and jogging. Just like the Mc in solo leveling who wants to be a better hunter and the system forced him to do some exercises everyday. I wish I had a system that forced me to do exercise too. I feel much better now both mentally and physically.",False,anime,1705996190.0,19dj8zi

Looking for a particular anime that I can't remember the name of,Help,"I feel like I remember watching at least some of it if not the entirety of the first season but it was a while ago. Let me try to break down some key points.


There's a 'Tower' of sorts, and it costs a lot to get into it I believe, but our main character got either teleported or isekai'd to a high floor of the tower, can't remember exactly, just know he's gotten there completely by accident.


Our main character ends up stuck in a cave or cavern but ends up gardening in there with the help of bees that end up being of the monster girl variety and clearly think very highly of him. Things are working out great, as far as being stuck in a cave goes.


I think that he was contacted at some point by some higher power within the system of the world to figure out how he ended up there?


Anything here ringing any bells for anyone? Google hates me and just keeps sending me to a manwa that's got a somewhat similar premise but it's definitely not the right thing. Or maybe it was all a fever dream, I dunno. Thanks in advance, will edit in the title if it gets found!",False,anime,1705994952.0,19diyeu

What's an anime that was forgotten once it ended but you wish had gotten more attention?,Discussion,"Imo BNA (Brand New Animal) really deserved more attention. The animation style and use of color is so outstanding, the story was cool and holds up, and it had a great OP and ED, but the second it ended people forgot it existed. 

Talentless Nana was also a great one that deserves more Attention. The premise is shocking and there's so many interesting twists where you think all may be lost but they just keep going. 

So what anime came out and stuck with you even though they didn't get as much attention as they deserved? Even if they were popular in their season they didn't last.",False,anime,1705993788.0,19dio2b

An amine I saw on TikTok.,Help,I can't remember how long ago it was maybe a year ago. The anime was about this guy that kinda looks like the solo leveling guy. When he levels up it opens up like a galaxy and he gets like planets. He has a little sister and lives next to an old man that teaches him how to use his powers. He has a sword and he goes to this school that ranks them into how powerful they are and at first he's the lowest. I remember a lot l'm not sure if it's solo leveling but from what I can tell I don't think it is because he doesn't have a sister.,False,anime,1705988300.0,19dh7mo
