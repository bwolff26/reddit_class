Help me with naming,Help,"I am currently attempting to write a novel, and most characters have something similar to a domain expansion, but i dont know what to name it as jjk fans would come after me if i used ‚ÄúDomain Expansion‚Äù (and also if you have any name ideas for an infinite library that would also be appreciated)

Maybe this helps in naming, but the power works based on what the user considers reality, and what the user understands about the laws of the universe. (Which change depending on the user)

**Questions for post series discussion:**

Q1 - What was your favourite aspect of Gintama? Characters? Comedy? All of it?

Q2 - What do you do at the end of the rewatch? Are you busy? Will you save me?

Q3 - Since it took 10 years between the last successful Gintama Rewatch and this one, what is something you'd like to say to either the host or the watchers of the next one in 2034?

Q4A - **FOR FIRST TIMERS** \- When did you realize that this show had an over-arching plot developing alongside all the jokes and which episode was ""The one"" that made you go, ""that's it, I'll watch it 'till the end""?

Q4B - **FOR REWATCHERS** \- How did it feel watching the series with all the previous knowledge of the plot and watch the characters interactions develop?

Q5 - Without taking in consideration the existence of overarching story of Gintama that existence was a secret revealed in later arcs, how would you expect the Gintama to end if Gintama was only 100% toilet humor/slapstick/gag humour and other aspects of low comedy?

Q6A - How would you murder your rewatch host?

Q6B - What's your favourite shitpost from the show or rewatch?

Q7 - Are there any other rewatches you will be joining?

Q8 - What character did you change your opinion on the most over the course of the series and how?

Q9 - Did any of the many anime references in Gintama made you more interested in watching the referenced show?

Q10 - Gintama has a unique form of storytelling, where there is alot of episodic, unconnected episodes, with the serious arcs sprinkled in between. its not until later where we get more serious arc instead of episodic, comedy and meta episodes. So overall did this format work for you? Did the comedy always land? and was it ever a chore to get through?

Q11 - Did you have a favorite running gag? If so, what was it?

"What Have You Watched This Past Week That is NOT a Currently Airing Show? [February 11th, 2024]",Weekly,"Title says it all - talk about the anime you watched this past week that are not a part of this Winter 2024 season (like **Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun 2nd Stage** or **Dungeon Meshi**), or a show that's continuing from previous seasons (like **Sousou no Frieren**).

With regards to Fall 2023 shows, however, it would be fine to write about them as long as you only began them after they finished airing. For example, it's fine to talk about watching **The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You** or **Arknights: Perish in Frost** if you started them after the final episode aired. Obviously, use your best judgement on this.

**Please use spoiler tags**; it's super simple stuff. An example below:

Would you rather a second season we never get or one you wish we never got...,Discussion,"I'd say take a shot every time the list of the most anticipated anime of a new season is dominated by sequels, but that's really just a reminder to feed into my alcoholism every three months.

The last few years has admittedly been a pretty good time to be a fan of older series, with many once dormant series coming back with new sequels, spinoffs, or remakes (*Full Metal Panic, Kimi ni Todoke, Fruits Basket, Spice and Wolf, Blue Exorcist, Trigun, Urusei Yatsura*, etc.). Us fans rejoice over these announcements with the hope that we can relive those warm nostalgic memories and use it as a spring board for new fans to pick up the series we love, but it really isn't all sunshine and rainbows? Sure, we all have our *Land of the Lustrous*' and *No Game No Life*'s that make us go ""man, it sure sucks that they never got a second season"" but we also have our *The Devil is a Part-timer*'s and *One Punch Man*'s that make us go ""*man*, it sure sucks that we never got a second season"".

Let's be real here. There's nothing worse than a sucky sequel, and history is peppered with franchises that were the talk of the town before an underwhelming to outright bad sequel came to take the wind out of their sales. In probably the most prominent example, *The Promised Neverland* used to be *the* rising Shounen title before that second season made it the laughing stock of the community. 

So that brings us to the question at hand. Would you rather a series never get that sequel you always wanted or for that sequel to come and ruin everything? Would you rather your lasting memory of a show be that of a fun time that just never had the time to get off the ground or a recommendation that you always have to plop an asterisk and a joke about a non-existent second season next to? Lastly to generalize, can a sequel be so bad that it retroactively affects your enjoyment of that first season? When, for an applicably unfinished series, is it better for the legacy of that series to end it after one season instead of chancing a second?",False,anime,1707676591.0,1aoeyn6

Here are some examples of quite different from each other shows where is about just right ""comedy amount"" that I want : One punch man, The Eminence in Shadow, Kill la Kill, Hinamatsuri, FLCL. Some things that come close: Overlord - with tiny bit more of comedy, Konosuba - with tiny bit more seriousness in plot, MASHLE - first season was kinda ok, might check second one when it will be out.

Find an old anime in a virtiual world (not SAO or Digimon),Help,"Hi everyone, I am trying to find an old anime that I watched in my childhood around 1 decade ago where the characters also existed in a virtual reality of some sorts.

They also had some kind of merge or evolution of those characters in the virtual world and they were like pets

Anime recommendations for a newbie who does not like stereotypical anime-like women,What to Watch?,"  Hey everyone! In late October 2023, I started my adventure with anime. Before that, I'd seen only a few animated, Japanese movies. I really like animated stuff and want much more recommendations for the following years; however, there is one thing I can't stand in anime - stereotypical anime women.  
So, the anime I am looking for should:

* have as few anime girls as possible (normal female characters are more than welcome),
* be the least sexist possible (Steins;gate was too much for me),
* have as few ""male gaze"" scenes as possible. If I want to watch boobs, asses or legs, I can go outside or visit xvideos,
* tell engaging, interesting, emotional stories,
* follow the quality over quantity principle,
* bonus points for: fantasy/science fiction, gore, mature themes, depressing or anxiety-inducing scenes,
* a special bonus for it being seinen genre (do you even call it a genre) - I don't like stories that are too childish.

What I have already seen (besides movies):

* Death Note - 7/10 (quality dropped af after the 2/3 of the anime)
* Berserk 1997 - 9+/10 (almost perfect; I'll be reading manga soon)
* Vinland Saga - 8/10
* Steins;gate - 7/10 (was really emotional but too animesque and I really hated the way they treated women characters)
* Neon Genesis Evangelion - 6/10 (I get the metaphors, but again, the female characters were meh and it was too odd)
* Darker Than Black - 6/10 (villain of the week story didn't feel right, and it had a lot of wasted potential)
* Serial Experiments Lain - 9/10 (awesome philosophical, cyberpunk anime, loved it)
* Erased - 9/10 (it was like this American novel ""Boy's Life"" by Robert McCammon, a bit dumb but nostalgic and emotional)

Also, I've seen thousands of mainstream films. As I am about to finish my film knowledge studies, I already have a bachelor's. I know a lot about film, so I like to enjoy the technical and narrative sides of anime as well, even if the story lacks something. :)  
Thank you for all the recommendations, and have a nice day or night!  ",False,anime,1707667473.0,1aobbn5

Need Help Remembering an Anime Music Video,Help,"Hey guys. I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this but I'll ask anyway.

I remember an anime-style music video similar to the concept of a whisker away. When the trailer for A Whisker Away came up I remembered that video but no matter how hard I tried I could not find it. 

This is what I remember but it could be different since it was a while back. There was a cat who was in love with a boy who was kind to her. She asked the kami-sama to let her be a human to be with the boy. She was eventually made into a girl but she was not allowed to touch the boy. The boy eventually almost got into an accident but was saved by the girl (cat), where she eventually turned into a cat again in front of the boy.

Greatly appreciate it if someone could help me with this one. It's been on and off in my mind since 2020 and I just want answers. Thank you Redditors.

86 is the first anime I've gotten into for a while,Discussion,"Really great show.  Just the right amount of action, character and world building.   Maybe it's because it's been a while since I watched anime (I go through phases of complete burnout on the medium/genre whatever after a while) but after finishing both seasons I can say it's a really solid show.  I'm surprised I don't hear more about it.  Maybe I just missed its point in the spotlight and don't know.  

I did watch the dub, which I know is a sin to some people but it was really good and I'm also upset to hear the VA for Shin passed away from cancer at 35.  That's really sad.  RIP dude.

Did this show get a lot of attention when it aired?  I don't think i was watching a lot of shows at the time and may have just missed it.  It's better than anything new I've tried to watch.",False,anime,1707664083.0,1aoa10s

"Lu Over The Wall (2017) is underrated, imo.",Discussion,"I just saw it today and I really liked it. I'd like to start with its negatives: although I like how fast-paced it was, at times it was teetering to chaotic. The story overall wasn't that particularly amazing, you could say it was just simple, nothing deep, life-changing, or compelling. There were also some several plotholes and stuff. The ending felt really too abrupt. Many of the characters, although I liked some of them, were ultimately just meh. I wanted more stuff about the mer-people but the movie was being quite scant about it.

Despite those, I did not regret watching it at all. The animation style is really dynamic and funky. I really like the dream-like/surreal and childish animation sequences. The first few minutes made me think the animation was gonna be ""slice-of-lifey"" but no, it was actually quite cartoony. The characters would move animatedly and expressively. The use of colors were pleasing to the eyes. I also liked its comedy. The soundtracks were really good, energetic, lively, and in some parts, beautiful (like that scene with the grandpa near the end, you'll know what I meant after you watch it). I also really liked the transition into its title card.

Overall, I think it's a movie that despite its destination and flaws, you might enjoy the journey like I did. It's been a while since an anime movie made me feel this awed and captivated like a child.

If I were to list what I disliked about it the most it would be (1) those plotholes about the missing people, (2) the lore of the curse, and (3) the abrupt and bittersweet ending, which personally felt it had more bitter than sweet. Although I guess I should've expected that sort of ending from the director of ""Devilman Crybaby"" and ""Ride your Wave"" T T",False,anime,1707652824.0,1ao6evd

Older anime fans: what is the biggest difference between the anime community now compared to when you were young?,Discussion,"For me I'd say it's the modern devotion to seasonal anime.

I got into anime in the 2000s, and I don't think I'd heard the term ""seasonal anime"" until the mid 2010's. In the 2000s I only knew about a new anime when a licensor or fansub group told me it existed, and from my perspective it wasn't happening in well-defined seasons.

In retrospect it's clear that if anime came out in Japan seasonally then the localizations must have been seasonal-with-lag, but it wasn't being marketed in that context. A new anime was just a mysterious product put in front of my face whenever a distributor felt like it.

The closest thing to a ""seasonal"" anime was any random anime airing on TV. Like, new episodes of Bleach every Tuesday at midnight, after Futurama and Robot Chicken. New episodes of Chrno Crusade on this random premium cable channel I didn't know showed anime.

If a fansub group uploaded a new anime weekly I didn't think of it in terms of seasons. It was just a group of people sharing something they liked.

So since there were no seasons for online anime or DVD/VHS, there was no communal expectation to keep with with the latest shows. You would just watch whatever interested you and then seek out discussion groups of people who liked the same anime.

Nowadays I hear people talking about watching seasonal anime they don't even like, because keeping up with seasonals is a core part of anime community discourse. And all the big anime YouTubers make seasonal recap videos.

It's kind of amazing how the Western anime marketing teams have trained people to want to watch more anime by promoting their seasonal nature.",False,anime,1707641434.0,1ao3mtl

Whats your opinion on SWORD ART ONLINE?,Discussion,"Sword Art Online is infamous and hated in the anime community. But personally(not that my opinion matters), though it had many (countless I must say) trashy issues like character development and bla2 stuffss, it was a very engaging watch specially the AINCARD ARC and the latter half of the show.l won't say it is very good or anything like that but at least the concept and all (especially the concept of A.I development from player experiences) was intriguing. What are your thoughts? .. And there is this people who without even watching the series more than one or two episodes talking as if they had finished even reading the manga and LN... LOL.. 

Plus the progressive movies are pretty good too for it fixes some of the pacing and character development issues..Personally it felt like the movies did some justice to the premise..

To add more detail, the 1st guy meet with the girl and lies to her about his backstory where he is a cool awesome secret agent or something.

I just sat down to watch the Anime for 100 Girlfriends on Crunchyroll, and I could only get through half of episode 2 before I had to stop due to the translation choices. I hate to make such a big deal out of something that is meant to be for entertainment and enjoyment, but the slang and phrases used REALLY take me out of the show.

My question then is, are there better translations out there, fan or otherwise? If not, would waiting for a Blu-ray release yield a different translation, or are the Crunchyroll translations used there too?  Again sorry for being this kind of person, I never thought I would be, but I have been so excited about this getting an anime and it is really bumming me out. I hope others are enjoying the show though! I can definitely see other people enjoying the modern slang.

Do you feel emotionally connected to Frieren?,Discussion,"It‚Äôs an anime I enjoy plenty just like the rest of you. There is no denying it is incredibly made. The folks at Madhouse spared no expense in delivering a quality production. Evan (the goat) Call once again treats our ears with his composing. The vibes are nice and ‚Äúchill‚Äù as one would describe, as well as melancholic. 

The main cast is likable and fun, but I have yet to say that I actually connect to them as  characters. And it‚Äôs hard to explain why that is.
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs simply the structure of the show being more on the slice of life side, or the fact that our trio has already gone through character development with either in flashbacks or off screen all together. 

There isn‚Äôt really much of stakes in universe yet. No one that can pose a challenge to the God that is Frieren, other than the spell granter who we‚Äôve only seen very little of.

Dubbed anime to watch that don't require 100% of my concentration.,What to Watch?,"This might be kind of an odd request.

Recs for getting back into anime,What to Watch?,"I used to be really into anime, I'd watch something (usually multiple somethings) everyday after school. But over college I got depressed and basically over the last 4-5 years ish I stopped doing pretty much everything I enjoyed including watching anime. I'm trying to get back into it, but I'm struggling to find something I'll enjoy.

I tend to prefer interesting sports anime or something that's thematically deep (? idk how to describe it). I've watched Naruto and HxH and loved them and tried to get into BNHA but I just didn't care even though friends said I'd love it especially since I'm into DC/Marvel comics stuff. I just couldn't get invested. I think my tastes have moved on from shonen.

The anime that still stick with me are things like Baby Steps, Haikyuu, Daiya no Ace, Run with the Wind, Ping Pong the Animation, March comes in like a Lion, Masterful Cat, Natsume Yuujincho, Seirei no Moribito, Kemono no Souja.

What are you guys favorite SHAFT works?,Discussion,"Just wanted to have a discussion on the studio itself as lately I've been fascinated with their works as I recall like it was yesterday when I saw Madoka Madoka fansubbed in 2011, and while all I saw to this day was the original series, it was fascinating for its surprisingly dark nature as what started off a typical moe type anime got subverted hard after a certain point.

&#x200B;

Secondly I've noticed how their works can be a bit trippy at times as sometimes anime viewers in the USA for instance will say that the studio's works are done with copious amounts of LSD, but I don't know if that's true as drug usage is often prohibited in Japan, but to me it's fascinating how surreal the studio's works are though as yeah they can be trippy at times such as their adaptation of Monogatari itself.",False,anime,1707589112.0,1anmlz7

I'd like to stop pirating anime. What streaming sites deserve my money?,Help,"I've been watching anime for 10 years and never spent a single dime on it. I'm financially stable now so I figure i should start putting money back into my favorite pasttime instead of just leeching. But various official anime streaming sites have reputations for poor video players, or bad comment sections, or bad pricing, or simply taking too much cut of the revenue and not sending enough money back to the studios that make the shows. What sites really DESERVE my money? Or should I just contribute to one of those animator charity things instead of going thru the corporate layer?

Looking for anime to watch,What to Watch?,"So basically im looking for high school anime to watch that is released before 2023. Im in my highschool phase. romance where the male character is really good looking like kakeru from glasslip is a plus. Or any romance anime where boy is lonely at first. I also dont mind dark psychological highschool animes like tomodachi game and another. 

Also i need help finding the anime ive been looking for. I suddenly dreamt it in my dream and felt like rewatching but i forgot the title. But i remember clearly 10 secs of the first episode and the main character. It starts off in the night. And then there is the main character who stands in the middle of something in the night. He has white greyish hair, blue jacket and a red scarf. Then his power has something to do with the scarf and there is blue flames. He looks like atsushi from bungo stray dogs except blue jacket and red scarf and probably whiter hair. 

Also theres another anime i want to remember. I think the male mc met the female mc in a game as their avatars. In real life, they are playing a game at separate places. And then they met in the real world and went to some academy? Their avatars look like chibis. Thank you!",False,anime,1707588001.0,1anm6o9

## Hold My Sake, Boys, It‚Äôs the Girls‚Äô Turn to Slay in Jujutsu Kaisen!

**Step aside, Gojo Satoru, it‚Äôs the girls‚Äô turn to slay!** This week, we‚Äôre ranking the hottest Jujutsu Kaisen characters, from Nobara Kugisaki‚Äôs peculiar yet cool power to Maki Zenin‚Äôs stoic beauty. We‚Äôll also dive into the enigmatic allure of Mei Mei, the sunshiney charm of Kasumi Miwa, and the hidden depths of Utahime Iori.

**Leading the pack is Kugisaki Nobara**

Nobara isn‚Äôt just about the looks (though let‚Äôs be real, that ginger-brown hair and those sharp eyes are killer). This girl‚Äôs got the power to back up her sass. Straw dolls dancing at her command? Check. Cursing curses with a flick of her wrist? Double check.

Need help finding an Anime about a spirit/psychic detective?,Help,"Hello, I only remember small pieces but I think the anime is from 2010 - 2020

It's an spirit/psychic detective who is a genius highschool kid. he's OP but he has poor health, so a highschool girl helps him solve these spiritual/psychic phenomenon's.

I remember there being an episode about a poltergeist and it getting completely out of hand and in the final episode he lets out a giant pyschic blade and faints?   


I am so sorry for the description but this is all I can remember.

The boy had blue hair and I think the girl had pink? I don't remember.

Anime to have dialogues/way of speaking that feel natural to natives,Help,"Hi, I'm planning to learn Japanese with lessons, etc. but meanwhile, I'll continue watching anime, and I know that I keep understanding what I'm hearing more and more every day while learning it. However, I'm kind of concerned if the anime I'll be watching consists of unnatural conversations and monologues. Like the ones that a native speaker would react to as ""We don't say such a sentence in our daily life/a situation like this"".

Nay are animes i didnt finished and don't feel like watching till the end for now.

The ones i loved: Death note(strong mc and antagonist), Demon slayer(s1 only since it got very dark in the forest), Chain saw man(loved the animation and there was alot of things happening), **Don't want magic,** Promise in neverland was also very dark, Yu Yu hakusho has a great story and had a fresh feeling, Alice in borderland(everyone go missing), Mob psycho(loved the animation and build up), Vinland saga(only s1, s2 was slow)

edit:

i have seen smart ass anime like todomachi game and death note and code geass and classroom of elite and some with moral dilemma like aot(genocide justified or not) where each one of us made a decision who we side with. Promise in neverland had a dark side and chase(loved it). And anime like phsyco pass s1 that had good sci-fi plus philosophy.

"When did the trend of ""redeeming the villainess"" get its start?",Discussion,"I know the more technical term is ""otome villainess"" but those tend to be specifically series where the protagonist is reincarnated as the villainess, while the trend I'm talking about is that plus series like *I'm in Love with the Villainess* and *Trapped in a Dating Sim*, where the villainess is a separate character from the protagonist but is shown in a more sympathetic light and that they're not truly that bad of a person.

I'm sure that technically these types of stories have always been around, but kind of like how kids fighting the death in arenas was a thing before *Hunger Games* but *Hunger Games* was the thing that every story after was trying to mimic the success of, given the increase in these types of villainess stories in anime (and assumedly light novels too) over the years I feel like there has to be a common denominator of some kind. Some story that really did something eye-catching with its villainess/villainess protagonist, or even some point in the media landscape where people started to feel the stock villainess character was being really underwritten or maybe even didn't deserve a lot of the terrible things they had happen to them in the standard stories.",False,anime,1707542293.0,1an8rzm

Gunslinger Girl and Confronting the Posthuman,Writing,"When you think about the technology of the future, it‚Äôs hard not to feel a little excited about what‚Äôs coming. Reinforcing your limbs with an exoskeleton or accessing the Internet from your mind sounds empowering and convenient. And *Cyberpunk Edgerunners* last year was very cool too. But I don‚Äôt think anime is as excited as we are about that premise. Between the debilitating side effects of cybernetic enhancements in *Cyberpunk Edgerunners* and the fears of an AI uprising in *Vivy: Fluorite Eye‚Äôs Song*, we‚Äôre actually really afraid. There‚Äôs an overwhelming sense of concern in making that leap into the future - of abandoning humanity and embracing technology. What does it mean to step into the world of robotics and AI? What does it mean to move to the next stage after humans?

##What is posthumanism?

Posthumanism is far above my anime-addled mind‚Äôs capabilities to fully dive into within 3000 words. But in a general sense, posthumanism is a philosophy about challenging the definition of humans and human-centric mindsets. It‚Äôs an evolution of Humanism, a perspective that places [humanity at the top of everything else](https://imgur.com/mj1qWII.png). Posthumanism challenges that superiority by asking what separates a human and an android. Is a [person with prosthetic arms](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*6HgGbD6tbRSk-2TZWYGBIw.jpeg) still human? Is [an organic brain in a metal body](https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/ghost-in-the-shell-artwork.png?width=1200&height=630&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp) still human? Are [apes with 90% shared DNA human](https://i0.wp.com/news.qoo-app.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/11/17110808171769.jpeg)? This philosophical framework argues that, as technology rapidly advances, we need to do away with these definitions, break down these identity-based borders, and accept that ‚Äúhumanity‚Äù as we know it will and has fundamentally changed. Alongside this breakdown of boundaries, the destruction of taxonomies and other hierarchies is also core to posthumanism‚Äôs tenets of unifying all types of people.

This again is a bit of a gross oversimplification of posthumanism, but what I want to highlight about posthumanism and *Gunslinger Girl* is how we struggle with that transformation. We‚Äôve all grown up with humans as the center of everything, and we have no idea what posthumans are because they have steadily crept up on us in the form of pacemakers or prosthetics. And sci-fi anime covering this topic emphasize that challenge to acknowledge this change in our society and thinking. Its characters grapple with their acceptance of cyborgs and AI, showing how we desperately cling to anthropocentrism. AI today is an incredibly controversial topic - are we willing to treat an AI the same way we treat our friends and family? Gunslinger Girl captures this anxiety, and shows the resulting brutality in its marginalization of the cyborgs. 

##Gunslinger Girl

*Spoilers for Season 1*

*Gunslinger Girl* sits in an interesting spot among science fiction anime. The story follows agents of Italy‚Äôs [Social Welfare Agency \(SWA\)](https://imgur.com/xQZuY59.png), a government-sponsored institution that provides rehabilitation services for [critically](https://imgur.com/77CQrMq.png) [injured](https://imgur.com/zoQKm2r.png) children. But it‚Äôs actually a front for a [counter-terrorism unit](https://imgur.com/2qVDtSA.png) that employs human, adult men handlers partnered with [brainwashed](https://imgur.com/AdWKmnN.png), [cybernetic girls](https://imgur.com/aQUxzAB.png) to [assassinate](https://imgur.com/Qp5fukI.png) everyone from bomb makers to political dissidents. *Gunslinger Girl* is set in modern (modern being early 2000s, same time as when the manga began publishing) Italy, where technology is advanced but not cyberpunk advanced. The cyborgs are noticeably anachronistic relative to the [other technology depicted](https://imgur.com/yTHC8RJ.png), but that only further emphasizes how novel posthumans are to the human cast members. 

These girls, who are either in [desperate situations medically or have been abandoned by their families](https://imgur.com/tvT7a55.png), undergo a procedure called ‚Äú[conditioning](https://imgur.com/yVPp5PM.png),‚Äù that transforms them into cyborgs with [superhuman strength](https://imgur.com/t72aAIQ.png) and [reflexes](https://imgur.com/QXYAI7d.png). Conditioning has some drawbacks though: the first is that this process and subsequent procedures [shorten the lifespan of the patient](https://imgur.com/NXWDOIb.png). Another is that oftentimes the girls are programmed to possess an [unwavering loyalty towards their handlers](https://imgur.com/fNcBDUJ.png), to the point of [injuring innocent people](https://imgur.com/Af8n3g9.png) because they vaguely [point a knife](https://imgur.com/hTblAol.png) in their [handler‚Äôs direction](https://imgur.com/YSOpqd9.png). Lastly, the conditioning also wears away at their mental faculties, like [dementia](https://imgur.com/Y1RvSB6.png). The girls are paired with an adult male and form a unit called a fratello (Italian for sibling). The man is called a ‚Äúhandler,‚Äù and he gets to name his new [cyborg](https://imgur.com/NOOBY8j.png) and [teach her how to operate as an killer](https://imgur.com/0ry4epK.png). After injuries during missions, the girls are constantly re-conditioned at varying levels, further wearing down their lifespans and memories in order to squeeze out additional combat usefulness.

Season 1 focuses on the introduction of these girls and their relationships with their handlers. Despite being conditioned surgically to be loyal [tools for assassination](https://imgur.com/LnkP6zL.png), they‚Äôre in many ways undeniably human. They cry. They bleed. They love. But their assassinations are uncanny, and that discrepancy makes it difficult for everyone else to treat them as human. Their handlers are older men who are generally ostracized or isolated from the rest of society for various reasons. As a result, their main social interactions come from one another and their cybernetic charges. These men are forced to [confront the posthuman](https://imgur.com/UNqdPTq.png), and how they react says a lot about what makes posthumanism so challenging to embrace.

##Cyborgs as tools

Each fratello has a story to tell about posthumanism. But none are quite as traditional as [Jean and Rico](https://imgur.com/bWlD0Hj.png). As a handler, Jean is *the* strict professional. He truly embodies the us vs. them mentality suggested by humanism. Jean sees his cyborg, Rico, and the others as [nothing more than tools](https://imgur.com/HCDg2DX.png). He even goes as far as to give his cyborg a [boy‚Äôs name](https://imgur.com/xbyOTOp.png), denying her gender identity and creating emotional distance. However, Rico has no concern over her treatment or new lifestyle. Because she retained her memories in spite of the conditioning, she only sees the improvements from her previous life and [finds the tradeoffs worthwhile](https://imgur.com/646m13Z.png). As a result, she is the most obedient of the group, readily sacrificing [her own](https://imgur.com/ucG0QyH.png) [happiness](https://imgur.com/OKsvopI.png) for [the sake of Jean and the SWA](https://imgur.com/hzMm3Dj.png). Even as Rico steadily begins to show more interest in other things like [love](https://imgur.com/vOppcQF.png), Jean is quick to shut down any attempts for Rico to indulge herself. At some point, [Rico expresses her fear of death](https://imgur.com/GuOAr1U.png), but even that desire for life is [denied](https://imgur.com/GwV9j0f.png) [by Jean](https://imgur.com/SW30iHE.png). [Cyborgs are meant to die for their handlers](https://imgur.com/HhRF7Dj.png). 

This fratello serves as a traditional representative of humanism. Jean prioritizes the handlers and the agency over the cyborgs. He goes out of his way to reject the cyborgs‚Äô desires and makes it clear that they serve humankind. And Rico happily plays the role of the tool, and calmly accepts Jean‚Äôs viewpoints. [Even if that means taking physical abuse](https://imgur.com/DJbk2xL.png). That sort of apathy only evokes a sense of [inhumanness](https://imgur.com/p3Mf9MW.png), but her interests in [art](https://imgur.com/XZUmphL.png) and the [meteor shower](https://imgur.com/kpxCK5P.png) reveal her personality buried under the dedication to Jean. Their relationship emphatically argues that this humanistic perspective suppresses the cyborg and denies the posthuman their freedom.

##Cyborgs as strangers

[Marco and Angela](https://imgur.com/n6lUfQU.png) are the first fratello of the SWA. Angela is the original cyborg, and [Marco takes to her immediately](https://imgur.com/UrgzXMT.png). The two form a [close bond](https://imgur.com/0ry4epK.png), thanks to the initial idleness of the SWA. Marco doted on Angela and the latter received an abundance of love from the rest of the agency. However, [his feelings begin to change](https://imgur.com/CpBbgij.png) when Angela begins combat and their relationship falters as the continuous conditioning wears down [Angela‚Äôs memory](https://imgur.com/6rM9Tdb.png). Marco becomes [distraught](https://imgur.com/lGQovUe.png) over the impact of Angela‚Äôs [conditioning](https://imgur.com/1Nr9Lo5.png) and, believing her to have [changed from their first meeting](https://imgur.com/8p9grVh.png), [grows](https://imgur.com/z8rwJWu.png) [distant](https://imgur.com/7rmKY6q.png). They become [further estranged](https://imgur.com/6ViPbr3.png) as Angela‚Äôs attempts to win Marco back [end in repeated failure](https://imgur.com/pnqCyU3.png). Eventually, her time runs out, and [thanks to Henrietta‚Äôs insistent efforts](https://imgur.com/TmMbwfq.png), [Marco and Angela](https://imgur.com/81EGtbF.png) are able to share [her final moments together](https://imgur.com/YiZg0ma.png).

In clear opposition to Jean, Marco did not see Angela as a cyborg at first. She was a human just like everybody else. But as Angela further cyberizes, she strays from that initial person Marco knew. Their relationship clearly illustrates how man‚Äôs attachment to the cyborg is predicated on how human it appears. As the veneer of the innocent girl fell away, Angela was ostracized. Rico represents cyborgs as a tool. But Angela represents that defined border between humans and posthumans. Angela does everything she can to meet the expectations of Marco and reposition herself in Marco‚Äôs good graces. But her actions as a cyborg would never be enough to bridge that divide. When Angela is hospitalized, Marco actually seeks to repair their relationship, but those efforts could also be interpreted as an affirmation of his loyalty to the Angela before all the conditioning. Marco is seen [hunting for the dog](https://imgur.com/hXYS52d.png) she used to own in her life prior to the SWA. Marco is still thinking about the human Angela [instead of spending more of his time with cyborg Angela](https://imgur.com/5frgw9T.png). Even at her deathbed, he still didn‚Äôt want this stranger wearing Angela‚Äôs skin.

##Cyborgs as humans

[Claes and Ravallo](https://imgur.com/vZGTRWz.png) are only together for a single episode, which serves as an origin story for Claes. She‚Äôs the one cyborg that mysteriously stays at the agency without a handler. In a flashback, Ravallo is shown joining the SWA as a favor for Jean. He ends up building a close bond with his cyborg, Claes. Despite being told to treat her as a tool, Ravallo can‚Äôt help but learn more about [Claes‚Äô past](https://imgur.com/a8Sx316.png), going so far as to use [her original name](https://imgur.com/xh2KE9B.png) [instead of a new one](https://imgur.com/wqjPPkB.png). They bond over [fishing](https://imgur.com/VGVoJjF.png) and [books](https://imgur.com/G860DM8.png), and Ravallo [treats her as a human](https://imgur.com/la6PZNt.png). But after a disagreement between Jose and Ravallo turns into an almost fatal shootout between [Henrietta](https://imgur.com/XkzCaGJ.png) and [Claes](https://imgur.com/MhFH1r7.png), Ravallo attempts to [expose](https://imgur.com/kXqfo1Q.png) [the SWA](https://imgur.com/YzWErBA.png). As a result, it is heavily implied that [he was assassinated](https://imgur.com/OtijTXm.png), and [Claes becomes unable to operate](https://imgur.com/ZU0OT08.png) or [even remember Ravallo](https://imgur.com/kDrjj6h.png), due to the mental toll of losing her handler. 

This episode covers a gradual development in Ravallo‚Äôs perspective on cyborgs. It starts with the [distaste](https://imgur.com/3NHOokw.png) Ravallo feels towards the program and Claes, and ends with him [feeling disgust towards himself](https://imgur.com/9d7MNJo.png) for supporting this system. [His last words to Claes are not only a plea to choose compassion over violence](https://imgur.com/muilBv7.png), but also [a request instead of an order](https://imgur.com/oWAZ63j.png). Ravallo rejects the SWA, and even attempts to return agency to Claes. [He goes as far as to return Claes‚Äô original glasses](https://imgur.com/oPjkaiE.png), something only the human Claes wore prior to the SWA. In many ways, this change in relationship is the philosophy posthumanists extol. Ravallo fights against the government‚Äôs intentions to use these girls as weapons. But it falls short of the grander philosophy which is about decentralizing humans. Ravallo wants Claes to return to being a young girl - the way he clings to her original name and her glasses reveals that [he did not care for the cyborg](https://imgur.com/VL0tICQ.png) but for the human Claes once was. And Claes had never even asked to return to her former life. She would‚Äôve been happy continuing to work by Ravallo‚Äôs side. Ravallo‚Äôs last actions are kind, but also a clear refutation of cyborgs in favor of humans.

So if being too compassionate to your cyborg is not posthumanism, and treating your cyborg as a weapon is not posthumanism, what is? 

##Cyborgs as cyborgs

[Jose \(sometimes spelled Giuse\) and Henrietta are our main pairing](https://imgur.com/Q0HDJr0.png). This fratello occupies a very interesting position in our humanism-posthumanism sliding scale. As such, Jose occupies a middle ground with respect to his feelings towards the cyborgs. He initially chooses Henrietta because of her dire circumstances: her entire family was slaughtered by a serial murderer, and the conditioning of the SWA was her only chance at survival. As a result of her conditioning, [Henrietta falls in love with Jose](https://imgur.com/sH1VwX7.png), but this loyalty also causes her to [go berserk any time he is threatened](https://imgur.com/leajXlE.png). He‚Äôs torn between his [guilt for functionally brainwashing a young girl](https://imgur.com/Ayqg5Mk.png) into a tool for murder and his desire for revenge against the terrorists who killed his family. As a result, Jose [spoils Henrietta](https://imgur.com/kDmsKrb.png) [as much as possible](https://imgur.com/JwsNuhy.png), [buying her gifts](https://imgur.com/jYECW6x.png) and [indulging in her requests](https://imgur.com/VTUXa5L.png). As sweet as they are to each other, it‚Äôs hard to ignore how Jose is so willing to sacrifice Henrietta in service of his retribution. He‚Äôs clearly using her as a tool, like his brother Jean.

However, there‚Äôs a turning point for our main duo in episode 11, when [agents from another SWA section](https://imgur.com/Fp0oI9q.png) are investigating the [murder of another fratello](https://imgur.com/PTJ44FT.png). They go to meet Henrietta and Jose because Triela, another cyborg, had advised them that [Jose and Henrietta were the people to see to learn more about fratello relationships](https://imgur.com/6bJTXji.png). The agents observe the [fondness the two have for each other](https://imgur.com/p7hG2Vh.png) and the [inhuman abilities](https://imgur.com/9BuBfsZ.png) of Henrietta in action. And of course those investigators [feel](https://imgur.com/jlEWRT9.png) [disgust](https://imgur.com/Fh1Ii8h.png) over what Henrietta has become and the way Jose uses Henrietta as a shield. But that perception gets flipped on its head. Henrietta ends up [revealing](https://imgur.com/CtN13zs.png) that the murders of the fratello were likely a result of a [murder-suicide](https://imgur.com/DnHZxOY.png): the cyborg killed her handler after realizing her handler will never [love](https://imgur.com/I9cENqC.png) [her](https://imgur.com/5pO3bqc.png) back. How did Henrietta know? It‚Äôs what [she would do](https://imgur.com/CRklAso.png) of course! And in a very sane move, Henrietta [pretends to shoot herself](https://imgur.com/myIsaF0.png) to [test](https://imgur.com/Pww3EsP.png) [Jose‚Äôs love](https://imgur.com/1Od3FlE.png). To which Jose passes with flying colors. 

The cyborgs are incredibly loyal and it may seem like the handlers take advantage of them. But this balance of power lies on a more precarious tightrope than it appears: handler and cyborg must maintain a form of [symbiosis](https://imgur.com/xX9xFMR.png). All the conditioning in the world is moot if the cyborg deems their fratello a lost cause. Throughout the season, it‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap that Jose is [manipulating Henrietta‚Äôs emotions](https://imgur.com/ZgudHKv.png) through gifts and outings. They are the most affectionate fratello and in some ways it becomes unsettling how close they are knowing that Henrietta‚Äôs love will likely never be returned. [But she understands that](https://imgur.com/ZgudHKv.png). [Jose understands it too](https://imgur.com/GK2iDsz.png). That‚Äôs why he says that handlers must be ‚Äú[someone they can respect](https://imgur.com/P6Ks7xj.png),‚Äù not love. You don‚Äôt say that if the conditioning makes betrayal an impossibility.

And that‚Äôs what makes Henrietta and Jose the relationship closest to the ideals of posthumanism. We‚Äôve set up this patriarchal structure within the fratellos in the previous examples, but with this reveal that cyborgs can kill their handlers, that hierarchy has changed. The power dynamic hasn‚Äôt quite equalized completely, [but the dividing line has blurred a bit](https://imgur.com/UpJhtqv.png). There‚Äôs a more nuanced give and take going on than what we expected. And that can be attributed to the [cyborgs‚Äô self awareness](https://imgur.com/Rz6uela.png). We‚Äôve viewed these fratello relationships so far based on how their handlers treat their cyborgs. Of course we‚Äôre horrified: this is [slavery](https://imgur.com/ZOZJBCV.png). [But the viewer hasn‚Äôt been asking how the cyborgs feel](https://imgur.com/7OHaywc.png). And as we‚Äôve seen in every previous fratello, [they accept it](https://imgur.com/SkAaU1M.png). They accept that they‚Äôre subservient to a group of men [who see them](https://imgur.com/zC3Edl1.png) as [replaceable](https://imgur.com/jxDX4EB.png). But those circumstances [aren‚Äôt a reason to give up on life](https://imgur.com/qZNjyUR.png). Henrietta throughout the season has also been pondering her place in the world. [She‚Äôs accepted her fate](https://imgur.com/T1tLpAW.png). The [conditioning is a part of who she is](https://imgur.com/MSYjrWm.png), and [she still finds it meaningful in spite of the evil committed against her](https://imgur.com/Ek4j1Sk.png). 

So much of posthumanism is about challenging the status quo. It‚Äôs about embracing multiple subjectivities and the blending of traditional roles whether they are ones of gender, politics, or cyborgs. Henrietta challenges both handlers and viewers to reconsider [how they look](https://imgur.com/sL1xjrg.png) [at the cyborgs](https://imgur.com/s8LKdg0.png). The domination we and Jose thought he had over Henrietta has evolved into a more collaborative relationship that [requires work from both partners](https://imgur.com/4Cg1s3M.png). The gender positions have been reversed in a few capacities, such as how in this show [the women protect the males](https://imgur.com/NbhSXNM.png). The boundary has been broken. Henrietta is [not a girl](https://imgur.com/WIpem89.png). [She is a cyborg](https://imgur.com/N73UuQY.png). The posthuman is here.

##Conclusion

In many ways, *Gunslinger Girl* does not embrace the posthuman. It places prepubescent girls at the mercy of white men, reaffirming the dominant male and submissive female gender and racial roles, and fails to collapse the patriarchal structure of the SWA. But Henrietta and Jose show us the way forward to posthumanism. This fratello takes the first step over this boundary by encouraging us to reevaluate our preconceived and heavily human-centric perspectives. Their relationship isn‚Äôt equitable yet, but if you‚Äôre willing to see from Henrietta‚Äôs eyes, you‚Äôll find that there‚Äôs more power and dignity in her position than what you assumed. 

And I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs uncommon. Many popular sci-fi works hover at the threshold of posthumanism: they challenge viewers on their assumptions on humanity, and constantly ask them if these posthumans are any different from them. *Star Wars* asks if robots like R2-D2 are human. *Her* asks if AI like Samantha are human. Gunslinger Girl asks if Henrietta is human. We‚Äôll keep saying yes until one day we don‚Äôt. And it will not be no because the posthuman isn‚Äôt human enough. It will be no because there are no more humans left.",False,anime,1707525714.0,1an3ib8

What is the lowest MAL rating that will make you watch an anime?,Discussion,"While I read reviews and listen to feedbacks from friends, MAL ratings play a huge part in my decision to watch an anime. A good show starts at 7.5, and my threshold is 6.8. Yes I know that MAL ratings might be biased but I still rely on them. What about you?

Edit: Thank you for your takes on this. Just wanted to add that I don't have a lot of time to try out anime and like almost all genres, which is why I look at ratings to choose anime with higher likelihood of me enjoying them.

What anime never dropped in quality since the first season?,Discussion,"Its easy to find shows that fumble after the first season like TPN or OPM season 2, and so its probably less common to find shows that consistently either stay the same or improve every season.

Please help me find my childhood anime,Help,"Ok so I really need help finding this anime from my childhood. It was about this blonde haired baby found by a man who already had two small sons and a wife in the woods. The girl had a golden bracelet if I remember correctly. The man took the Girl in and raised her like his own the sons also loved her and treated her well like a family member. The father eventually passed away and left his son's and wife along with the girl behind. The mother grew to hate the girl over time don't even remember why and then the oldest son had to leave and look for a job to support his family. So he left to the city. I don't know what happened to the younger brother but I know that in the meantime as the older brother was gone the mother told the girl that she was actually found and she's not her mother and to stop calling her that. The girl eventually left and idk how but like met this guy who's very rich and all and yea.

"Is anime too ""flash in the pan"" these days? It feels most shows don't stick after they end or stay popular",Discussion,"Think about how a lot of the anime that people still talk about today are now 20-30 year old anime. Cowboy Bebop, Evangelion, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball, etc. It seems no matter how old these shows are they simply stuck around and transcended generations. Same for ongoing manga shonen like One Piece that are still going.

It feels like most shows from the 2010's are already pretty much forgotten or most people don't talk about them much anymore even the ones that were really popular at the time. I was just thinking how a lot of shows I watched in the last few years or just recently ended are pretty much ""gone like the wind.""

If Madoka wasn't getting a new movie I'd never hear about it again. What happened to Violet Evergarden? The Promised Neverland? Psycho Pass? Kill la Kill? Akame a kill? Angel Beats? Space Dandy?

What anime were heavily hyped and anticipated but turned out to be a disappointment?,Discussion,"Some shows in mind:

1. **Akame Ga Kill** \- This was the first show that came to mind. First half was really great and intense, but then the character deaths and terrible pacing in the second cour tanked the show.
2. **Tokyo Revengers** \- This is the most notable one. I assume all the hype was lost considering how terrible the manga ended, and the MC is unbearable because he always gets his ass whooped, and Disney getting their hands on the anime really screwed up its promotion and marketing.
3. **The Tokyo Mew Mew Reboot** \- I got excited when a reboot was going to be made for the original series in the 2000's. While it was hyped and talked about a lot because of its cute and more colorful polish, the reboot itself unfortunately didn't live up to expectations. It was rather bland and lackluster.
4. I know it's still ongoing, but **Mato Seihei no Slave (Chained Soldier)** is already a mess despite being a very hyped ecchi harem show this season. The sloppy CGI, skipped ""rewards"" scenes from the manga, weird character designs and mediocre background art, the female MC Kyouka's voice doesn't fit her, and the censorship are really a bother. In other words, the studio has already butchered this adaptation.",False,anime,1707504865.0,1amvl1g

recommend me Power Fantasy/OP MC where the other characters knows the MC is strong,What to Watch?,"I'm getting back into anime after a couple years, and I'm just wondering if there's any new-ish animes that have strong or overpowered MC.

but not ones where the world around them for some reason doesn't acknowledge, or doesn't know that hes strong. 

It also doesn't have to be power or magic. For example, he can be really smart, and others acknowledge that.

Anime doesn't make me feel strong emotions. I kinda want it to.,What to Watch?,"So I'm kinda new to watching anime. I've tried in the past but I have a bad habit of losing interest in long shows. So anyway I've seen maybe 10 or 15 anime most if which could be considered sad or had really sad moments. Sword Art Online is the only anime to have ever made me cry (idk why). So I guess I'm looking for something that will really get my emotions going. Whether it be sad or happy I just want to enjoy anime, and most of my enjoyment in movies, and tv shows comes from how attached I get to it. I'd love some recommendations. <3",False,anime,1707494048.0,1amr9h4
"anime appreciation, feeling emotionally drained...",Discussion,"**No spoilers for any shows mentioned here, and appreciate anyone who takes time to read this splat :)**

I decided to start watching anime in December with the goal of watching shows that did not have over sexualised female characters/ too much fan service, this started with the first episode of **Frieren Beyond Journey's End.** I watched all that had aired and I loved it so much that I thought about it all the time, rewatched scenes, repeated full episodes and listened to the music constantly. I also ordered the manga books but I won't read them yet as I want to follow the show first. I am eyeing up a cool (but expensive :( lol) figurine. **I am caught up as far as E18 so not spoilers please** ;)

I then went on to watch **Violet Evergarden** (the series) and this one really left me in an absolute state, I was constantly getting sad thinking about everything and again had to keep rewatching scenes and was totally obsessed with the music. I even ordered some figurines which cost more than I would care to admit lol. The story of this anime is so touching I almost can't think about it. I have seen the final movie but I don't include it amongst my passions.

I was very nervous about my next choice, after watching the previous two I considered taking a break because I worried nothing could meet those standards and emotions, but next came **Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song** and it absolutely blew me away. This one was so interesting, especially when rewatching scenes to actually understand the (at times) complicated plot kept adding more layers and reasons to love the show. This one also got me very emotional too and I love rewatching scenes / listening to the music. Also ordered a figurine, light novel collection and a plush.

Then it was time for **Girls' Last Tour,** this one took an episode or 2 to click but I came to really love this show and the characters - except for what I considered to be a couple of unnecessary depictions. This one didn't have me rewatching scenes/ music as much as the others, but overall I felt that I had watched something really special and it left me feeling like I actually missed the characters. I have now ordered some of the light novels that will hopefully give me a little more of this story. There are some cool little figures available for this one but the sale prices are way too high, maybe one day.

Most recently I watched **Spice And Wolf.** This one almost got turned off in the first episode because I thought it was just going to be some creepy ""oooo cute wolf girl"" gimmick and not much more, but the voice acting (english dub in my case) was so incredible that I had to give it a chance, and after watching a few episodes I could not believe how amazing this show was, and in such good taste. There is such a captivating and complex dynamic between the characters achieved through top class dialog and story telling, these characters could do nothing but walk around chatting all day and I would love watching it. I felt absolutely destroyed when the credits of the last episode rolled knowing there was no more. I was recommended the audio books of the light novels to continue with the story and when I started listening to one I actually teared up just because I was so happy to be back with these characters again. I ordered a little figurine for this one (it was hard to get one that wasn't creepy but I found a nice one) and I will also have copies of the light novels for my collection.

All in all I am emotionally drained by these shows haha, I cannot believe how interesting and beautiful these stories have been, how incredible some of the animation was, how amazing the music was, and how inspired the voice acting was.

I can't wait to watch more anime in future but for now I think I need a break rewatching Sopranos or something, these shows just hit too damn hard :(",False,anime,1707493819.0,1amr6an

[ANNOUNCEMENT] r/anime sings 192: Brand New World (One Piece OP 6),Misc.,"Hello everyone! As much as I was thinking my previous project would be my last one, I‚Äôm here once again to announce yet another r/anime sings project! About halfway through last year, I started what quickly became my second favorite anime of all time, one I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre all familiar with: One Piece. I was surprised to learn that the only r/anime sings project we‚Äôve done for it so far was *We Are!* in 2017, so I decided it was time I fix that. I put this project up to a vote a month ago, and the winner was quite clear: we‚Äôll be singing OP 6, *Brand New World*. I‚Äôm excited for it, since this OP in particular got very little time in the spotlight.

WHAT IF??? (ANIME EDITION),Discussion,"There are a lot of decisions made in anime which are usually amazing. But sometimes they are outright bad like giving plot armor to certain characters, killing off characters way too early, power of friendship/love, or plain one-dimensional characters who never change, etc. Or sometimes you just wanted it to turn out differently even though the original idea was good enough.

So how would you alter elements of the story, and what impact do you think these changes would have on the overall plot?

For example, ever wonder what would have happened if in:

**(SPOILERS AHEAD)**

* \[Dragon Ball\] >!You cannot resurrect someone when they die / Goku kills  Vegeta and several others whenever he has the chance.!<
* \[Death Note\] >!Light manages to win at the end instead of dying / L somehow manages to escape death by outsmarting Light.!<
* \[Naruto\] >!Kurama never turns good / Orochimaru possesses Sasuke as planned / Naruto and Sasuke never get sudden power-ups at the end / Neji doesn't die during the war.!<

Which animes will never be forgotten?,Discussion,"Dragonballz and Pokemon are the first ones to come to my mind. They started it all and still to this day whenever they get new content people get hyped like the sparking zero trailer. Next up are Naruto and One piece obviously. They were the biggest animes in 2000's era and have been a huge cultural phenomenon. I am kinda iffy about Bleach on the other hand. Sure it was part of the big three in the west but during its absence and hatred from the community it heavily declined in popularity. Yes Naruto did also get hate but there are still so many people talking about it as compared to Bleach which isn't anywhere as recognizable as the other two.

Other animes that come to my mind are Yu gi oh and Sailor Moon. However I don't really see people talking about them despite being classics like DBZ. Yu Gi Oh is popular because of its cards not necessarily due to its anime and Sailor Moon isn't even as popular as Bleach in these times.

There can be a case for Jjk and Aot but it depends if they are still being talked about 5 or 6 years later down the line. Aot has ended so it may effect its popularity and Jjk's manga is also closer to its end.

LIKES

Attack on Titan- my first anime ever. In love with the world building, the politics, and the fast paced storyline that left me guessing!

Code Geass- my most recent watch. Once again, I love the politics, the world building, and fast paced storyline. I also really liked the some of the romantic elements‚Ä¶ which I didn‚Äôt think that I‚Äôd care about lol.

Elfen Lied- full disclosure, I was told to try this one for the tits‚Ä¶ certainly didn‚Äôt disappoint lol. The story was great, and the gore was just ridiculous but not in a bad way. Def not a favorite, but I would watch it again.

DISLIKES

Death Note- I liked the concept, it was just too slow for me. I found myself getting bored. Also, the character development just wasn‚Äôt there for me. Too wordy, not enough action.

Fullmetal Alchemist- to be 100% fair, I‚Äôm not sure that I gave this one a sufficient chance. I got through about four or five episodes and just thought ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why, but I just don‚Äôt like this‚Äù

Just found and watched a true hidden gem of 2014: Nobunaga Concerto,Watch This!,"Synopsis:  History classes have never interested Saburo. He never saw the point of learning something that happened in the past, let alone a few hundred years ago. But when he falls off a wall, he travels through a wormhole and ends up in 16th century ancient Japan. He meets a very young Oda Nobunaga, one of the most influential figures in Japanese history, who turns out to be identical in appearance as Saburo. The real Nobunaga, sick of the castle life and wanting to travel, orders Saburo to take his place. Without knowing how to get back to his time, Saburo tries to make sure history isn‚Äôt rewritten for the infamous Oda Nobunaga.

&#x200B;

Review:  

The anime may initially deter viewers due to its CGI-like art style, but this aspect quickly becomes inconsequential when compared to the richness of its narrative. The story revolves around Saburo, a disinterested student of history who unexpectedly finds himself thrust into 16th century ancient Japan after a fortuitous fall. Here, he encounters a young Oda Nobunaga, and their striking resemblance leads to Saburo assuming Nobunaga's identity at the latter's behest. What follows is a gripping tale of Saburo's attempts to navigate the intricacies of history while safeguarding its integrity.

With a rating of 9/10, this anime captivates audiences with its compelling characters, witty humor, and exhilarating battle sequences. Moreover, it offers valuable insights into Japan's Sengoku era, cleverly intertwining historical events with imaginative storytelling. While the narrative takes creative liberties with famous historical figures, it maintains enough fidelity to keep it recognizable and engaging. As a fan of time travel narratives, this series stands out as a favorite, delivering an immensely satisfying viewing experience.

However, the disappointment lies in its brevity, spanning only 10 episodes. Thankfully, fans can delve deeper into the intricacies of the story through the extensive manga series, comprising 22 volumes. Anticipation mounts for the release of the final volume, promising closure to this captivating saga. Avoiding spoilers, I wholeheartedly recommend this anime to anyone seeking a blend of history, adventure, and entertainment.",False,anime,1707455423.0,1amgg2l

Fixing Dragon Ball GT's Super 17 Saga,Discussion,"Dragon Ball GT's Super 17 Saga is something even most of its fans won't defend and recommend skipping. Even considering the series run being cut short, I still have no idea what anybody was thinking with this arc. We have a bunch of past villains escaping Hell, which is just used as a backdrop for an arc where Android 17 turns evil and fuses with a copy of himself that was somehow built in Hell. Why Dr. Gero and Dr. Myuu aren't bothering with enhancing Cell or Rildo, their creations who defeated Goku, and the latter still being loyal, is anybody's guess.

&#x200B;

Despite Super 17 being set up as the main villain, 17 is barely in the arc with most of the focus being on the easily killed past villains. The villain with the most screen time is Dr. Myuu, someone nobody was interested in seeing. Super 17 has almost no personality, acting as the type of muscle head villain we'd expect from on serial Z movies. His fight with Goku is terrible, once Goku turns Super Saiyan 4, he uses a barrage of ki attack and keeps using more when that doesn't work, which isn't how Goku normally fights. The reveal that Super 17 absorbs ki attacks is treated as him being immune to any attack Goku can launch, even though Goku could still use physical attacks (in fact he uses those more than ki attacks), plus when Super 17 stops moving because the main 17 fights to gain control, Goku punches a hole in him, at his base level.

&#x200B;

I have seen suggestions for how to fix this arc by having a more sensible explanation for why 17, and also 18 (a popular suggestion is having 18 become an antagonist), becomes evil and is a threat when the last time we saw the androids fight, they were fodder for Cell. I don't see what the point of turning the android siblings evil is. Especially 17, he barely appeared after the Cell Saga so there isn't much impact to him becoming a villain.

&#x200B;

If the route of the android being villains is used, then the anime should have given them more screen time. They could have taken part in the Dragon Ball hunt and/or appeared as allies in the Baby Saga, explaining that because they were partially mechanical, Baby couldn't control them. Having them remain allies when so many characters were controlled by a villain would have had the siblings becoming enemies have far more impact.

&#x200B;

If anybody has any other ideas for how they would make the idea of the 17 & 18 being made into tragic villains, leave a comment.

&#x200B;

Personally, I would scrap (no pun intended) the idea of using the androids as villains. Myuu and Gero kicking off the arc could stay. Gero recruits Myuu to assist with the plan to escape Hell. By using parts from Myuu's various minions who got sent to Hell, the evil scientists build a device that locates the Soul Cleansing Machine, taking inspiration from Fusion Reborn. This device has been siphoning off power from the villains to keep them growing more powerful, as well as removing the evil from the souls of evildoers who chose to reincarnate.

&#x200B;

The villains blow up the machine, and the release of evil makes them more powerful than ever. Rather than being comic relief, Cell and Frieza led the onslaught of evildoers as they broke out of Hell to take their revenge on Goku and his friends.

&#x200B;

From here, we get a series of fights with the protagonists fighting the past villains. I haven't thought of all the matchups except for the climax.

&#x200B;

Cell finds Mr. Satan and reveals him to be a fraud by killing one of Mr. Satan's fans on live television. He doesn't care about Mr. Satan taking credit for defeating him (he didn't even realize it happened) he is merely hoping to break the world's spirits. Cell is faced by Gohan, who is not nerfed in my version of events, and Pan, who is not a damsel in distress in my version of events. Gohan barely gets to do anything, especially with his daughter. Given how much screen time Pan gets, her father should get to do something with her. Cell is eager for the chance to get revenge on Gohan (not Goku; GT forgets that Gohan killed Cell, not Goku) and promises to make him watch as his daughter and father-in-law.

&#x200B;

In the end, a father/daughter Kamehameha kills Cell.

&#x200B;

Vegeta has an encounter with Nappa and does apologize for killing him. In the anime, Nappa and Vegeta's encounter does nothing it being Nappa, you could replace Nappa with any villain who was killed by Vegeta. I don't believe that this could lead to Nappa getting redeemed; Vegeta's redemption took a very specific set of circumstances, but if anybody has any ideas for what a redemption arc might look like, again, feel free to leave a comment. I want to hear ideas.

&#x200B;

The other main event is a rematch with Frieza, and I would rather Vegeta defeat him rather than Goku. Vegeta deserves a break.

&#x200B;

After each villain is beaten, they lose the power they gained from absorbing the raw concentrated evil so they wouldn't escape a second time.

&#x200B;

If anybody has any more ideas, please leave a comment. And please do not leave comments that boil down to ""GT was a mistake"" or ""this arc wouldn't work no matter what...""

"Getting a good ""overview"" of the anime scene for research?",Help,"I'm writing a novel where the protagonist is a walking encyclopedia of anime (and games, but this isn't r/gaming) and often sees life through a lens of tropes and references.  I've been an on-again-off-again weeb since I was little in the late 90's, so I definitely have a broad-brushstroke knowledge, but I haven't been seriously into it for the better part of the last decade, so my knowledge is way behind, and there's been such an explosion of new titles since then that I feel hopelessly lost trying to catch up.

Are there any ways you'd recommend trying to get an overview of the shows I should check out and .  For example, when I was a kid, I had a copy of The Anime Encyclopedia (that was when most of the notable anime that existed could fit in one book) and one other I can't remember the name of, but I don't think there's been anything like that for a while.

I research by listening to podcasts like Trash Taste and video essays on various titles that seem interesting while I'm cleaning up around the apartment and stuff - and when one catches my eye, I'll watch a few episodes to get a feel of it. But I still feel like I'm just scratching the surface and am dismayed by how limited my scope is, and by how little of each series I usually have time to get into.

So finally now is the time again for our: [Seasonal Salt!](#salt ""Seasonal Salt!"") 

Here's the quick rundown of the contest for those who aren't familiar with it (especially after a suspend of more than four months). Through the next week we will decide who [r/anime](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/)'s favorite new girl of the previous season was. Rounds will be posted **daily** at about 9pm Eastern Standard Time. (As many of previous voters might not hear the news about the reborn of Animebracket I decided to move to the old time for fall contest as it seems the traffic volume of r/anime are also higher at the original time).

**Bracket rundown:**

* 64 total girls
* **1 nomination round**
* 1 elimination round
* 1 bracket group

**Please remember to check the rules in the nomination page and who is already in the contest before nominating!**

Also, as have been discussed before in [annual salt 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/116rwo3/and_ranime_s_best_girl_of_2022_is/j983u9i/), there will be a pick-up mechanism for top sixteen-losers to fight for wild card slots for annual best girl. 

Remainder: The rule about whether or not a girl in a sequel that has appeared in the previous seasonal but do not enter the previous seasonal could be nominated in this seasonal is clarified in the current seasonal rule. As long as **she has never passed the elimination and entered the main bracket for any previous best girl/best character contests** she could be nominated. Hope this modification could help some girls who just do not get their shiny moments in the previous season get their actual chance for the seasonal!

forgetting stuff when watching anime,Help,"hi guys.
Lately, especially when watching seasonal anime, I feel like I forget too many things and feel frustrated about it.
When the new episode of a show comes out, I‚Äôll try to ask myself what happened on the one before (does it make sense?) and most of the time I can‚Äôt remember it, and it irritates me.
But, when I try to watch the episode before the latest in order to remember what happened, just a few frame will be enough to remember everything.

This and the fact that in general I don‚Äôt have a bad memory leads me to think that this problem is related to something else, but Idk, so if you have any suggestions or similar things happened to you pls tell me! (also, it doesn‚Äôt happen only when watching seasonal anime).

What would you do if you were being interrogated?

Is Masami the worst anime father of all time?

Bonus) Take a shot any time Kon in his blog post talking about this episode mentions the name Akio Jissoji

Bonus 2) It's very sad in hindsight that this episode is apparently based on the works of Akio Jissoji and within 5 years of each other, Jissoji and Kon died of cancer. Life is unfair.

Need an ultra specific rec,What to Watch?,"I'm fairly new to anime and I'm looking to see if there's something that has everything I'm looking for and maybe more importantly, what I'm avoiding. After a few entries, I've discovered what I really enjoy is a love story. Here's what has struck me so far:


Cyberpunk: Edgerunners

Basically perfect. It's mature, enthralling, amazing soundtrack, excellent characterization, hyper emotional, and it doesn't drag on. I do wish it had a happier ending but maybe that would have detracted from it overall. I love cyberpunk setting anyway which is what drew me to the show but David and Lucy made it perfect. I also like that they don't draw the silly faces, people don't blush constantly at inane things, and no one speaks in a register only audible to dolphins.

Darling in the Franxx:

Saw this because it came recommended after cyberpunk. Everything about 02 and Hiro is perfect. Everything else.. not so much. Aside from those two, it seems like everyone else is characterized as clueless and lifeless. I also think it's really off-putting how sexualized the act of piloting is; it gets to the point where there is so much innuendo that it honestly would be less cringy if they just had sex. It seemed like there were a lot of plot holes based around that fact too. On top of that, I don't like giant robots. I see why this came recommended but I would rather watch a supercut of just 02 and Hiro.

Castlevania:

Shockingly good. Came recommended since it's also based on a game. Crazy good voice actors, it looks like a lot of care went into animating it. Trevor and Sypha are fun to watch together and I'm glad they got a happy ending. This show really should have been shorter, they jumped the shark so many times. Besides that, I think most everyone is well characterized. 

Horimiya:

Came recommended when looking for something romantic. It definitely fits that bill but I think it suffers from the same problem as Darling in the Franxx. If it was just Hori and Miyamura, it would have been more interesting. It also does silly faces way too often. I like how realistic Hori is. I also like that they use sex as just a symbol to show romantic connection and not a plot device to create drama. 

What I gather is that I want to find something centering around a couple. The setting doesn't matter as much as long as the two characters coming together is not the focus of the plot. I like more realism and a more mature tone. Interestingly I think shows that include nudity and sex scenes tend to automatically skew toward the tone I prefer since they have to be aimed at a mature audience. And, if possible, happy endings are better- though sometimes a sad ending is the whole reason a show is good.
I also wanna hear from you if you just like the same shows I do!

TL;DR
What's a show with a couple like Lucy and David or 02 and Hiro?",False,anime,1707424444.0,1am5ibd
"Those of you who grew up in the 90's with anime, do you miss this Era of anime / Time when things seemed more ""action oriented""",Discussion,"Weird question but, does anybody miss their childhood days of watching anime and adolescence of it?  
Shows like  
Cowboy Bebop, DBZ, Trigun, Outlaw Star, Inuyasha, Gundam Wing, Even Naruto  
I guess this would be shonen genre  
But also shows like Hayao Miyazaki Movies / Escaflowne / EVA / Utena / Project A-ko

I mean, I dunno what I'm trying to say really. I feel like a lot of modern animes are more ""Moe"" or ""Fanservice"" or ""Realistic / Mature Themed"" I guess this would Seinen..  
90s had moe too like tenchi muyo / love hina and everything but Anime felt ""different"" back then to me, like I'd be SUPER HYPED to watch it and waiting for the next episodes, I think the last anime I was like this with was Bleach

I don't know what point I'm trying to make here TBH lol. Basically, there was a certain feeling I use to have with watching anime back then week by week and keeping up with newest episodes and being hyped for next ep that I no longer get anymore and everything seems more ""moe"" nowadays or rehashed type of shows I guess all the Isekai plots and modern convenience of being able to download full series and watch in a day has me burnt out a bit.

Just finished [Blend S],Discussion,"SO i originally found this anime during COVID due to the Supra memes 2.5 years ago but didn't continue after 2nd episode for some reason.

Yesterday I was feeling quite nostalgic so I started watching and honestly it was such a joy to watch it.

The show all around has such a positive vibe, no bs drama about characters misunderstanding just 12 episodes of cute interactions.

The MC likes the FMC but isn't a creep about it, unlike other MCs he not drooling over the FMCs body and actually treats her like a human who makes mistakes at times, their interactions feel natural and not clich√© as you'd expect from this kind of anime.

Our FMC Maika, she is one of the cutest anime characters I have ever seen, kind, caring, a little airhead at times but overall just a gentle person.

Anyway, this was a really nostalgic experience, although I am sure COVID was a bad time period for many people but everyone in my family was fine and it was one of the most carefree and happy period of my life.

Watching this reminded me of all those memes during COVID lol, I feel really happy rn

What to watch? Need help!,What to Watch?,"What to watch? Preferably something similar to one of these: Hellsing, NieR: Automata ver1.1a, Fullmetal Alchemist, Solo Leveling, or One Punch Man (Preferably not too long (over 100 episodes))

So far I watched: A bit of JoJo (until around 28th episode), each anime which I listed above, JJK, CSM, Magic & Muscles, and a few others which I don‚Äôt remember. Any suggestions?",False,anime,1707413436.0,1am14ip
make a crew for a starship :D,Discussion," You must crew a starship with anime people.

You must have:

Captain.

First Officer.

Operations.

Navigation.

Tactical,

Medical.

you may have any other crew at positions you think would fit.

Clearly you could go with people that know what they are doing (Henry Gloval, Robotech for Captain)

Or you could go with just - whoever is funny or you think could do the job well enough. Or maybe you will crash and burn :D

They can be all from the same anime but cooler if they are not.

\~\~\~

Captain: Kasumi/Misty (Pokemon)

First Officer. Light Yagami (Death Note)

Operations. Dana Sterling (Robotech)

Navigation. Mendoza (The Mysterious Cities of Gold) ((I count this as anime because it was French/Japanese team effort for S1 but I am not sure it ""counts"" as anime))

Tactical: Porco Rosso (Porco Rosso)

Medical: Sailor Mercury/Ami Mizuno (Sailor Moon)

\~\~\~\~

Misty likes to boss people around and given that she was a leader of a gym, she could do well as leader - if we tack on some age to her, she would work as a CO.

Light is hyper focused on justice once he gets the death note, but before that is a smart young adult, if he never encountered the Death Note he might indeed be very good at a role such as this.

Dana has been in the Southern Cross, and as such knows the ropes, so to speak, but she might not quite fit the mold for Ops, still she is smart enough and clever so maybe she could do okay.

Mendoza has used the stars to navagate the waters of the earth, with enough infomation, I think he could apply that to outerspace as well.

Porco knows how to fight :D

Ami always wanted to be a doctor, now she is one. \^\_\^

Better adaptation than TYBW?,Discussion,"Serious question, is there any anime out there that is a better adaptation of the source material than Bleach TYBW? TYBW has god tier ost, amazing fight animations and art style/design choices, incredible voice acting, and great extensions to fights and scenes.

Incongruities in Sasaki and Peeps,Discussion,"I‚Äôm watching episode five of Sasaki and Peeps, and I have some questions, so I‚Äôll get straight to the point. 

The first thing I noticed is that the law enforcement dispatched to the crime scene were just casually speaking loud enough about Sasaki-san‚Äôs ability to spontaneously create icicles. At least, loud enough for his roommate to hear, which makes me wonder if leaks like this are often so easy to come across. This is modern Japan meaning there is access to the internet and information spreads like a memetic virus. Even if they could somehow stifle discussion around it, there is no way this super secret agency is lax about letting information get out and then only getting serious and putting their full power into silencing it when it does. 

The second is about Hoshizaki-san‚Äôs psychokinetic abilities. She can control the properties of water including its temperature, right? Surely she doesn‚Äôt *need* to bring a water bottle with her at all times, because she can just condensate the water vapor in the air. Tokyo is known for being especially humid because of its location on the Earth and [anthropogenic water vapor emissions](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2007WR006624) because of the urban environment.

When i was a kid I had VHS copy of an anime film. I loved it. Watched it all the time. I dont know the title, but I remember the movie clearly.

She has a henchman/hitman with a very distinctive aesthetic. He has a gasmask in the shape of an elephant face. Complete with tusks. I believe he also shoots some form of darts from his hands but that could be me getting my wires crossed. Another part that stands out is the evil empress has these faces that crawl around on legs.

Anyone Else Remember The International Channel?,Discussion,"I can remember making sure to stay up late every Saturday night for Slayers, and every Sunday night for DBZ (which was ahead of Toonami in the Buu saga, and started airing GT before Kid Buu showed up on US television if memory serves me correctly).

Is anyone else only watching Solo Leveling bc the OP is cool?,Discussion,"Tbh I'm pretty bummed by Solo Leveling. I had high expectations, and the first two episodes were cool. And then it went straight to boring and pretty disappointing. I didn't read the webtoon or anything but I hate the ""weak soft guy gets strong and mean"" thing that seems to happen in most webtoons with overpowered characters. 

Seeing episode 3-4 really bummed me out. Like a lot of anime this season they started strong and now it's plummeting.

I don‚Äôt understand why people hate fan service,Discussion,"I genuinely don‚Äôt get it and it‚Äôs frankly annoying to see so many people completely throw out good stories because they were distracted by fan service and didn‚Äôt like it. I understand that there‚Äôs TPO for it but even when it seems out of place (ex. Tamaki from Fire Force), does it REALLY distract you? I can‚Äôt exactly bring a lot of examples where fan service is prevalently out of place because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever noticed it tbh. The biggest of these is Fire Force based on the amount of complaints I‚Äôve seen on it and even that complaint doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. Clearly the animanga doesn‚Äôt take itself seriously enough to even say that it gets completely ruined by fanservice, and the funniest part is that it is literally the part of Tamaki‚Äôs character. You can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs out of place when it‚Äôs been purposely built into the script from the beginning and has a genuine cause behind it that makes sense for the story. 

I‚Äôm just so confused by how people find it distracting to point of putting you off of the entire show. Is it just a tolerance difference between those who get put off and those who don‚Äôt? To me it sounds more like a personal inclination of the viewer to sexualize any revealing thing or erotic undertone. 

For some context on my standpoint. I don‚Äôt find a woman in a bikini sexually pleasing unless we‚Äôre in a romantic relationship, similarly I don‚Äôt find an anime character who got caught changing and just in her underwear pleasing either, thus in the the grand scheme of consuming, I‚Äôm not distracted nor pay it any mind.

I don‚Äôt mean any negativity towards those who do get put off by fan service, I‚Äôm just confused on the why it‚Äôs so distracting to you because it seems more like a personal sexualization than a problem with the show itself?",False,anime,1707362525.0,1alm04s

What are you guys favorite anime dubs?,Discussion,"Just curious was all as I‚Äôve noticed that when it comes to anime itself, people usually say to stick with the subbed version first, but then it got me wondering about cases where the English dub managed to be just as worthy.




For me personally, some examples include shows like Outlaw Star and Cowboy Bebop as don‚Äôt get me wrong that hearing the former subbed is still good, but when I listen to the (uncut) dub it just feels so good in performance as it goes so well with the show‚Äôs Western feel that it can be hard to tell that I am watching a dubbed anime because of how the dub is performed.

Trying to find a old Ecchi anime,Help,"I‚Äôm trying to remember the name of an old Ecchi anime from when I was younger. I remember some key details from it too.

The main girl had pink hair

It was from the 2000‚Äôs 

It was a Ecchi Harem anime

It had the characters go to school

The first part of the opening episode had the pink hair girl had a panty shot and got angel wings

It had 1 episode where the main character was tied up and in his swim suit

Another episode where it was raining and the main character helped out another girl apart of the Harem

There was a trio of girls who were the antagonist who hated the main character 

And finally I believe there was a OVA where the main characters went to the where it was uncensored and you got to see everything. 

And also in that OVA too the trio of girls piloted a robot

For a while I thought it was called Girls Bravo but it just showed me Bravo Girls. Another show I thought it might be was Heaven's Lost Property but the animation was too good to be that. The animation in the show I‚Äôm looking for is like early to mid 2000‚Äôs anime where it looked shiny and flat, similar to looking like elfin lied (and also no it‚Äôs not Elfin lied either it wasn‚Äôt gory).

If you were transported to another world, which reaction would you more likely have: Maniwa's, or Ikari's?

Did you ever think we would get a video game episode out of this show?

Bonus) Who would win in a fight: Holy Warrior, God Warrior, or The Ultimate Warrior?

Bonus 2) With the two detectives being transported into a video game world, does this technically make the show now an isekai?

"Came back from a long hiatus, need reccos",What to Watch?,"So Ive not watched a single anime since Parasyte, Another and OPM about a year + ago (maybe even more).

Recently I watched Hellgirl and ended up binging on more supernatural anime. Back to back completed Hellgirl, Shiki, the rooftop one with the schoolgirl and pantsu shots lol.

Tried watching The New World but Ive kinda tapped out midway, it just didnt click for me.
Of the recent ones Ive watched I think Shiki stuck with me the most. So Im looking for similar anime to that.

Currently watching Tokyo Ghoul - I mean.. it‚Äôs good. Not great, not bad, just good IMO so far (finishing season 1). 

otherwise, I like:

- Harry Potter (both)

Recomend finished anime with OP MC,What to Watch?,"Hi there good people, i have watched quite a lot of anime lately and although i wibe with a lot of them (a lot of isekai, prog fantasy, OP MCs)  but im fed up with one or two seasons and neverending waiting. Recently i watched Arifureta wich i liked. Somewhat dickish OP MC (like shield hero season one) is nice food. But it is not finished. Like there is nothing with end. Isekai is basically never a finished show aside from old clasics like Magic night Rayearth or Hack.

So, recomend me some FINISHED (not canceled or on hiatus or Berserk) anime with OP MC, preferably with dickish personality but not necesary.  Can be fantasy, isekai, scify, whatever category Slime was.... i dont really care. 

Im kinda boomer in this.  In ye old times i feel like there were so many shows that told its story in season or two and now everything is Naruto (i love naruto but when i started it it was allmost over). I dont know how to navigate this anime climate. I did not watch much for a few years and its just copletely different climate now.

Thank you very much :)",False,anime,1707327845.0,1al8rzf

Recommendations for similar anime please?,What to Watch?,"Hi all!

Do you guys have any recommendations for Anime like these, and these reasons (doesn't have to be the same genre):

* **Solo Leveling**
   * Serious & dark (but not Shield Hero dark) beginning, undertone of mystery and intrigue of future events, fantastic art helps deliver on all of the above. There's also a real sense of progression for MC's power and story both.
   * Ofc the show is new with only a few episodes out, but it reminds me of Berserk of Gluttony but better (so far)
* **Apothecary Diaries** / **The Saint's Magic Power is Omnipotent**
   * Female MC that's not OP (in combat), emphasizing everyday stuff like research & studying & relationships with a budding romance, without being only about the romance either
   * A good, strong guy protecting the MC for that daww <3
* **World Trigger**
   * Just fantastic in every way, esp high internal consistency and logic behind every person & event, also an interesting story with progression

Also one last weird question: I just started watching Absolute Duo (not convinced so far but nvm that). In the first episode \[Spoilers: Absolute Duo s01e01\] >!the school forces the students to fight their partner, and only the winner gets admitted. I couldn't help but think: what if the MC had simply lost on purpose because: 1) the school lied and set those conditions to force the students to give their best so they could be measured for their potential, but were really going to allow admittance to both either way, or 2) the school really did use arbitrary, unreliable, even cruel methods to disqualify potentially brilliant students, in which case it didn't live up to its reputation and the MC would rather just take their skills elsewhere instead. Either way, from the MC's PoV losing would be the right choice.!<

Is there any anime where the MC openly stands up to and criticizes flawed systems and authorities regardless of consequences, but is also strong enough to be able to afford to, even force the systems and authority figures themselves to change for better in the end? So the story would revolve around that? I know this is a weird question, but this is something of a recurring pet peeve of mine about a lot of shows and games too where I wish some shows handled it like this! The Irregular at Magic High School kinda touches on this idea, but not really.

Thank you all in advance!

Edit: Oh and bonus points if it's available on Crunchy in Europe! Thanks!",False,anime,1707323758.0,1al73qc

She said Oushi is ""typical over protective hearie."" She could definitely relate to Yuki's family not knowing sign, as my grandparents (while incredibly progressive about it for their time in other areas) also never learned her language. I'd love to hear other opinions!!!

Refently I saturated my favourite anime to watch and currently I‚Äòve binged Frieren both anime and manga, I have to say that i absolutely didn‚Äôt thought it could hook me so much, the animation is superb, character are well designed and their chemistry is great, I especially love how well it balances action, adventure and [Iyashikei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iyashikei)  vibes.

I‚Äòve taken this example because it encompass very well what I search in anime, something that is visually appealing (mushishi, mob psycho, bungou stray dogs, vivy fluorite song, nichijou, berserk the old one, ghost in the shell); has a solid engaging story that isn‚Äôt predictable unlike anime such as Black Clover or Shield Hero (my brain still hurts); has a certain level of attention for soundtrack and music (i don‚Äôt expect something as vivy fluorite, beck or the amazing Takt Op.).   


You will see that i‚Äôm missing a lot of classics like Code Geass but I really can‚Äôt stand that style of animation and sadly for me it‚Äôs a deal breaker even if the anime is good. I‚Äòm not expecting bones, madhouse or mbappa level of animation every single episode, hell I‚Äôve enjoyed Pop team epic, inferno cop and other weird anime because of their creativity and smart use of simple animation to deliver great story or great action / funny scenes. 

While i‚Äôve said that i enjoy the [Iyashikei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iyashikei) genre I tend to get bored quickly as my level of attention has been dramatically abused by the fast paced and action packed genre. Masterpieces as Mushishi of Aria are surely great but I consume them very slowly and occasionally. 

Ideally I would search something with the story of Fruit Basket, the animation that can span from Great Teacher Onizuka (one of my favourite of all time, I‚Äôve read everything from the author) to the much modern Heavenly Delusion (which was sadly a delusion), the comedy of Nichijou, Full Metal Panic or Golden Boy or Love is war.

I‚Äôm aware of great suggestions such as Yuru Camp, Place further than the universe, Toradora, Wonder Egg Priority, The Melancholy of... etc but for now i‚Äôm searching something else. 

I‚Äôm more than open to other suggestions of other genre the only condition is that i‚Äôm asking you your really favourite and best and most emotional anime the you hold dear.

Would you recommend/re-watch Highschool of the Dead?,Discussion,"Lemme explain.

Is a very entertaining anime. With a great production quality. And the journey the main characters do towards adulthood and responsibility, while embracing their emotions and their ups and downs, is something between great and amazing (still trying to decide one of them) There's so much to learn from it.

However, there's a ""but..."". Female characters are beautiful and that's Ok. But their outfits are totally objectifying, and even more many gratuitous situations. And every shot where they appear is just fan service. It isn't something that happens a scene or two. Cannot be skipped, is just everywhere.

For me it's a pity that an anime of this quality seems to be so addressed to male audiences. Hence the question. I'm not sure me (as a guy) would even feel totally comfortable re-watching it.

Fast forward she wakes up in this like giant done world thing in space with other humans she doesn't know, but all have some sort of powers as she. It seemed like they were learning to harness them.

Its a child male anime protaganist who's main antagonist is himself, aged up, as a teenager/young man. The two versions of him have different personalities in the same body, seperate awareness.( I know its Definitely not Yu-Gi-Oh, i would recognize the hair. ) This was just some generic looking black hair school uniform Anime guy. I dont really know what to call this trope or genre where i guess the main character has split personality or two souls in one body? Its not a writing trick to have the character talk to himself for exposition or mental issue like multiple personality disorder because when the older personality takes over it PHYSICALLY  changes the child's body into the older copy. Magic. Poof. 

Help me out here...?  What do i search for this kind of genre?  If memory serves right, maybe hes a vampire or something?  Does anyone have any guesses what it might be? There cant be that many anime where the main lead is two people in the same body.

What anime would be the best visual novel?,Discussion,"Imagine if an anime was adapted as a visual novel with all the visual novel effects, soundtracks, and most importantly, routes, letting you explore different options and what could happen. Some visual novels could incorporate some gameplay aspects too where how you perform can change outcomes.

What are some anime that would benefit from this? And please no boring answers like anime adapted from a visual novel (Clannad, Steins Gate, Fate, Higurashi, Danganronpa)

For me, a harem would be an obvious choice. Something like the **Quintuplets** would be nice to see the routes of each girl.

**Renai Flops** would be fantastic as a VN, especially with the twist so you can go different routes to see what they could do with the twist which I can't spoil.

Other than harem, I think Hyouka would be an amazing VN because of the different possible aspects, events, and maybe it could have a cool little detective minigame gameplay.

Shadows House would be amazing too for the same reasons.

Yuru Camp would be really boring but maybe they could pull it off like having stunning scenery or having different campgrounds as your routes would be really cool.

Saekano, mostly because it's parodying VN games.

Amagi Brilliant Park, would be a cool feature to see if you can save the park in time and have different routes to check out the different park aspects and stuff.

Komi and Hitoribocchi see how many friends you can make lol.

Re Zero and other time travel anime would be super cool too.

I mean sure I can understand why Shimoneta had to end a bit abruptly as Anna‚Äôs voice actress (or seiyu) had passed away right after Season 1 had finished airing, but I cannot help but still miss that particular show as it was a lot of fun for pushing boundaries by being as racy or wild as much as possible.

Can anyone help me indentify an anime I watched as a child?,Help,"Hi, I just remember this one specific scene from an anime I watched as a child, if someone could help me identify the name of the anime, that would be amazing. I think I was watching it around late 1990s early 2000s on the channel animax.

The protagonist is a girl who has magic powers. She's not a child but maybe a teenager. She had short dark hair. She has a best friend who's got longer hair and both of them have boyfriends.

The scene I remember is that she's on a call with her boyfriend and he's confessing his feelings to her, but she somehow astro travels to him. She can see him, but he cannot and that's when she discovers this new power. She's trying to tell him about her power and he's trying to confess his feelings.

Another scene I remember is that she tells this to her best friend and in the night she, her best friend, best friend's boyfriend and the protagonist's boyfriend meet by a hill. The protagonist conjures two flying carriages and they each go in one with their boyfriends taking in the night view of the city.

Committing to a big anime,Discussion,I have decided to watch One piece. I was wanting to watch an adventure anime. I also have committed to watch it as it has so much number of episodes and it has scared me. 1000 + episodes. Naruto was the only big anime i was able to watch. I couldn't commit to bleach (40eps) and hunter x hunter (40eps) and my hero academia (Season 4). I watch 10 eps so far.,False,anime,1707210754.0,1ak5ohi

Good Anime Recommendations with No Romance and Good Animation?,What to Watch?,"To be honest, I've been looking all over for this type of anime. It doesn't really matter what kind of genre it is or the gender of the MC. But I'm just a little bit picky with the artstyle and animation unless the plot is like, crazy good. As long as there's no romance I think that's good enough! So if you're kind enough, please drop some of your recommendations and thank you for the help!",False,anime,1707209820.0,1ak5guj
Anime Series in Limbo: Did you forget about these anime too?,Discussion,"I'm sure many of you have watched numerous anime series, and it's easy to lose track of some over time. We eagerly wait for new seasons, only to eventually forget about certain shows. I'd like to inquire about anime whose current status is uncertain, and, likely, they won't be renewed. As I was going through my list I was surprised by the number of shows I forgot about:

* No Game No Life (I know a lot of people didn't forget about this, but the studio did)
* Gosick (Mystery)
* Seitokai Yakuindomo (Depends on GoHands)
* Noragami
* Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress (Anime Original, So it depends on Wit Studio)
* Gakuen Babysitters (Wholesome)
* Nichijou
* Kono Oto Tomare (The music gives me goosebumps)
* How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom (The only isekai-harem anime that ain't mid)
* Barakamon
* Burning Kabaddi
* Gin no Saji (Silver Spoon)
* Demi-chan wa Kataritai (more satou sensei x takahashi sensei)
* Tanaka-kun is Always Listless
* Senryuu Shoujo
* D-frag!
* We never learn (We need the endings animated)
* Tokyo Ghoul (We only got the first season right? Yup! Season 2 isn't announced yet.)

Also, feel free to correct me if you have any news regarding the above anime.

P.S. I know some of the shows above have lost popularity or have poor sales. But still, I wish they had continued. Out of all these anime, I'm genuinely frustrated with Gosick as it was released during the ""2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami"" which was the most powerful earthquake in Japan (source: Wikipedia). So not a lot of people watched it and wasn't that popular. The author of the novels kept writing the books, so now I've decided to study Japanese to read them as they are not translated.

Edit: Ik Tokyo Ghoul has more seasons, I was just joking as I refuse to acknowledge the messy adaptation.",False,anime,1707209069.0,1ak5axb
Any anime you wish to experience it for the first time again?,Discussion,"We watch lots of anime and like some of those very much but we have only a very few anime that we we want to experience it for the very first time again. For example, I have watched nearly five hundred shows over 10 years but there is a very few anime I wish to experience it again, like it is the the first time. For me the shows are...

Clannad (After Story)

Steins;Gate 

Code Geass (for the ending)

Yu Yu Hakusho (the whole journey to the end)

A Silent Voice (both the anime & the manga)

Erased

Death Note (want to fall in love with anime again because it was my gateway anime)

Fmab (for everything)

Parasyte 

Attack On Titan (till season 3. NOT ANYTHING AFTERWARDS)

Tsuki Ga Kirei

Princess Mononoke 

There're many other anime that are in my 10/10 list but didn't mention because the above list is for the shows that I wish to experience for the first time again, not want to cry ugly or be depressed for weeks. For eg. Madoka Magica, Shin Sekai Yori, Evangelion, Violet Evergarden, Grave Of The Fireflies etc etc are the best examples of ""worth watching once, but not twice because you don't have the courage to go through that same phase again"" but only Clannad is the exception here (for me atleast).

Anime being released in chunks,Discussion,"What do you guys think about anime that gets released in large chunks? Like bleach TTYBW and JoJo‚Äôs Stone ocean. I personally think that it really kills all the momentum a show has as well as the hype it has. Bleach being separated feels a bit weird but in the end since it gets released weekly when it is airing does a lot to keep it relevant. However stone ocean imo had 0 hype at all because when its parts came out, all the episodes came out at once. That honestly is the killer combo I think, being released in parts but also all at once lets people binge all of it and it loses all hype and relevancy in like a week. Compare stone ocean to Golden Wind and it‚Äôs like night and day in that aspect. Every episode of golden wind felt like an event for its viewers to discuss and make memes about what happened that week, but with stone ocean I didn‚Äôt feel any of that. Weekly is def the way to go, not at once or in chunks. (Not talking about seasons, just seasons that are cut up in parts)

Thoughts On The Dorohedoro anime....,Discussion,"I was a little surprised and honestly intrigued when the Dorohedoro anime adaption was announced a few years ago. However, I knew I would probably end up being disappointed. It's not because of the CG (although I'm not a CG fan). And it's not that it's terrible, because it isn't. I've just always felt that Q Hayashida's work is so distinct as far as art style, and that it actually loses a lot of charm and identity when it's not in black and white. The art of the manga hooked me immediately, and the unique story and characters kept me invested. It was the same with Dai Dark. It's similar in my mind to how Junji Ito's work never quite seems to work as anime. Does anyone else feel like this? Or is it just me?",False,anime,1707199842.0,1ak31v9

Classroom of the Elite Character Recap (Up to S3 Episode 5),Discussion," Series naturally has a lot of characters and I saw some people were confused so thought I‚Äôd drop this to give some refreshers for anyone who forgot who‚Äôs who. Not gonna mention anything that hasn‚Äôt been in the anime (S3 episode 5) up to this point. There‚Äôs a lot of moving plot lines at once so will give a brief summary of what their current or recent situation is along with what we know so far. As a side note almost every character here is usually referred to by their last name so I wouldn‚Äôt bother trying to remember their first name to make things easier. Limited to 20 pics so will drop for the ones who are newer or more forgettable

**Class C (formerly Class D)**

Kiyotaka Ayanokoji - Not much to say here (will be referring to him as Kiyo for the rest of this post)

Suzune Horikita - Has slowly been growing as a leader since season 1, has a big inferiority complex over her brother thus is constantly trying to be like him, wants Kushida to put her talents to use for the class but has not had any luck convincing her

Kikyo Kushida - Two faced, destroyed her class in middle school by leaking everybody‚Äôs secrets, wants Kiyo and Suzune expelled as a result of knowing this, was willing to work with Ryuuen in S2 and recently was said to be in contact with Nagumo, leaked some class secrets to Kiyo in the recent ep as part of a deal. Kiyo wants to expel her because she‚Äôs a nuisance

Kei Karuizawa - Bullied in the past, does some dirty work for Kiyo in exchange to being protected by him and seems to be catching some feelings for him, broke up with Hirata recently

Yosuke Hirata - The cool, popular and reliable guy of the class

Rokusuke Koenji - Complete wild card who does whatever he wants, seems to have very competent abilities but we don‚Äôt know to what extent, recently figured out Kiyo defeated Ryuuen just by feeling the grip of his hand

Ken Sudo - Sports jock, has a crush on Suzune, is trying to improve academically to not burden the class

Haruki Yamauchi - Dickhead

Airi Sakura - Shy and meek, used to be an idol. Not much screentime since season 1 but she was saved from a creepy staff member by Kiyo and has liked him since. Joined the ‚ÄòAyanokoji Group‚Äô in season 2 along with the next 3 characters¬†

Teruhiko Yukimura - One of the smarter characters in the class, was in Kiyo‚Äôs group on the first exams of S2 and S3. Self conscious about his lack of physical ability and wants to be beneficial to the class. Prefers to be called ‚ÄúKeisei‚Äù by his friends in the Ayano Group¬†

Others: Most of the rest are just background characters for now so I wouldn‚Äôt worry about them, there is a girl with a red hair clip named Shinohara who Ike defended from the rumors in S3 recently, there‚Äôs also an anime nerd with glasses named Sotomura who a lot of people call the ‚ÄòProfessor‚Äô.

&#x200B;

**Class A**¬†

Arisu Sakyanagi - Arrogant type, leads with mind games and trickery, knows about the ‚ÄúWhite Room‚Äù where Kiyo was raised and is interested in defeating him as she calls him a ‚Äúfalse genius‚Äù created by his father.

Kohei Katsuragi - Bald guy. In season 1 Class A was split between the Sakayanagi and Katsuragi factions, after he fumbled the exam he lost almost all influence thus Sakayanagi is widely seen as the class leader after that

Totsuka Yahiko - Basically the only Katsuragi dickrider left in the class

Miyabi Nagumo - Newly inducted student council president, everyone in the second year is said to be in the palm of his hand, is said to want to do things very differently than how the school has been ran thus far and that there will likely be a lot of expulsions next year as a result.

Nazuna Asahina - One of the few in the second year that doesn‚Äôt seem to be a Nagumo dickrider and said she kind of wants to see him be humbled, gave Kiyo some information after he found her dropped hairpin

**Third year students:**

Manabu Horikita - Former student council president who‚Äôs about to graduate soon, strongly competent, is one of the few that knows Kiyo hides his abilities, wants him to take down Nagumo. Has animosity towards his sister for unknown reasons

Akane Tachibana - Manabu‚Äôs right hand (possible girlfriend?), got expelled after Nagumo ordered her group to intentionally lose, however was saved after the class paid a large amount of points¬†

Chie Hoshinomiya (Class B) - Childish type and gets drunk easily, seems to have history with Chabashira

Sakagami (Class D) - Not relevant but also seems to be a dick, hasn‚Äôt really done much besides instigate Sudo‚Äôs expulsion in season 1¬†

Mashima (Class A) - Not much known, also seems to have history with Hoshinomiya and Chabashira

Why? A character straight out asked in the last episode I watched, and the answer was ‚Äúhe‚Äôs special‚Äù. Which he definitively is, just not in a good way. Why do these nobles and people of culture fall in love with this guy after a couple of days? It feels like the characters just act however the story needs them to act to get in the direction it needs to go, no matter how unreasonable or weird.

My bf isn‚Äôt a huge anime buff like I‚Äôm sure most of you are, many of you are saying these are basic which is fine, he just started getting into it and is excited and wants to share it with me! Thank you for the suggestions on anime that are more in line with different interests. 

As for what I usually watch, my favourite genre for shows is sitcoms, but I also like drama and romance. 

Edit 2 - wow thank you all for your answers! I‚Äôll come back to this post over the next while as I deliberate what to watch, so many helpful answers :)

Update I told him about my post and all these answers and he said he would enjoy if I watched one from the list because of how much he loves all of these and wants to see if, when I watch them, I will also enjoy it with him. But he also said he wants to find other shows as well that we could both get into that are more my speed genre-wise. All these responses will really help! I haven‚Äôt decided which one from the list I most want to watch but so far from what I‚Äôve read from u guys I‚Äôm leaning towards either hunter x hunter or demon slayer. 

Another edit okay I‚Äôm still leaning towards demon slayer but haven‚Äôt decided fully yet. I‚Äôm going to watch one of these first (despite all the comments saying they‚Äôre bad starter animes) because I want to try to get into something he loves, which are these animes. Some of the ones I‚Äôm planning on looking into, based on what seem to be the most popular recommendations here, are your name, my hero academia, apothecary diaries, spy x family, cowboy bebop, howls moving castle, and violet evergarden. I really am shocked this post got so much attention but thank you all for your responses to me!

what is the real life inspiration behind Blue exorcist's Shima and this spoilers fellow from Noragami?,Help,"**\*\*\* manga spoilers of Noragami \*\*\* I'm personally reading it right now and I'm only at ch49.**

I figure there must a culture reference that inspired these 2 fellas. They give similar vibes. They both act aloof & pretend to be carefree , look like young boys, and use the golden staff with several rings held by a circle.

This is the [fella](https://imgur.com/a/rHmPigk) if you haven't already figured out, right below a picture of Shima. 

Right by each other, I realize they look distinctively different. But Goddamn do they act alike!

First of all, I realize the staff could potentially be a separate reference, I remember seeing it throughout several stories but for now I can only remember Hantengu of anger. ( Demon slayer)

After snooping on Sekido (Hantengu of anger), I realize the staff is named khakkhara & carried by Buddhist monks. Putting all of it here just to make sure this is correct, right?

**Now back to the character design, I'm wondering if their personality & looks are inspired by real life references or a random stereotype Story makers like to use?** 

Like white-haired black people, or Tsunderes, or overly angry bullies, etc...

or perhaps some folklore?

I have a very low tolerance for cringe and tropes, and I'm looking for suggestions for us. We aren't really interested in Shonen or shows that go past the ~25ep mark. 

I personally can't stand the excessive ""fan service"" in a lot of shows, or trope characters such as self insert protagonists, 900 vampire who looks 10, token cute characters, etc... I know that eliminates like 90% of anime, so I've had a hard time finding stuff that sounds interesting. 

Here are some animes I like, or atleast remember liking to give an idea. 

- Steins gate
- Garden of sinners 
- Fate zero
- Rainbow
- Bacanno
- Ghost in the shell + SAC 
- Spice and wolf
- Darker than black
- Jin-Roh
- Violet Evergarden
- A silent voice
- Your name
- Most Gibli movies
- Redline
- Hellsing ultimate 
- Parasite 

We just watched 91 days, which we all liked. We just started Ergo Proxy, and other than Pino I think its interesting so far. The next is Kaiji. I've heard Monster is good and we are considering watching it but its long.

We've also all seen a decent bit of the popular shows like Death Note, Code Geass, FMA brotherhood, and AoT.",False,anime,1707170273.0,1ajsur6

"It's funny how the most controversial part of the ""I'm in Love with the Villainess"" anime wasn't a thing in the original light novel.",Discussion," I quite enjoyed the first season of ""I'm in Love with the Villainess"" so I decided to start reading through the light novel series that the anime is based on. I'm only up through the second volume right now but the anime covered only the first volume and an eighth of the second, so I've already read through more than everything that was in the anime and so feel comfortable making this post.

A small bit of controversy the anime had was a part of it where people felt the series was comparing homosexuality and incestuous relationships as equivalent, albeit in a positive way.

Quick summary, the main character, Rae Taylor, is an open lesbian in love with Claire Fran√ßois. Someone within their school is orchestrating a series of events with the intention of fanning the flames of class resentment and even goes so far as to unleash a chimera within the school in order to slaughter the aristocrats. Rae confronts the culprit, who turns out to be Lambert, the brother of Claire's maid Lene. Why is he doing all of this? He's being blackmailed by a mysterious man in a mask who will have Lene killed if Lambert doesn't do as he says. Lambert tries to feign like just threatening the life of his sister wouldn't be enough to get him to betray his family and the kingdom, especially when his family directly benefits from supporting the kingdom and having it prosper. Rae then hits him and us with the twist that Lambert and Lene's relationship is not strictly one of brother and sister. The two are involved in an incestuous relationship with each other.

And here's where the main bit of controversy comes in. In the original Japanese, Rae says the line ‚ÄúHomosexual love is not the only one to be taboo.‚Äù to further confirm to Lambert, and then soon Lene who has been listening in on the scene, that she knows what they've been doing.

This was less controversial with the English dub, where Rae instead says the line ""They call homosexuality the forbidden love, meanwhile you're in a relationship with your sibling-"", with Rae's VA (who is great, by the way, I love how much of a little friggin' gremlin she makes Rae in a lot of scenes) delivering it in a less than sympathetic manner. But obviously that doesn't change what the original line was.

...Nor does that line in the anime change what the line, or lack there of, was in the original source material, that being the light novel.

Yeah, there is no line like that from Rae at any point in the book where this arc happens or even in the next book when they mention and reflect on the events of the first.

Benefit of the doubt, I think the reason the anime added a line like that, beyond trying to establish a thematic parallel between the protagonist and one of the antagonists, is because the LNs are told from Rae's first person perspective (Konosuba does the same with Kazuma, if I recall correctly). It's Rae's narration that clarifies that Lamert and Lene are in an incestuous relationship, something that isn't nearly as present in the anime, and thus the people making the anime may have felt that leaving things as just what the dialogue in the book was might have been too vague for the audience to understand what the implication was.

Here's that section in the book (page 224 for anyone who wants to see the full context and make sure I'm not taking things *out* of context):

>""My sister is certainly important to me. But do you really think I would endanger the rest of my family for only her?""  
>  
>""If she were only your sister.""  
>  
>This time Lambert's eyes widened. He couldn't have imagined I knew what I'd just implied.  
>  
>""How much do you...""  
>  
>""I told you, everything.""  
>  
>Lambert was in love with Lene - not as a sister, but as a woman. In order to save her, he had no choice but to do as the people holding her hostage directed, even if it meant putting their family's livelihood in danger.

Unlike this scene in the anime, and same for the rest of it, at no point does Rae or the story draw any kind of parallel between familial incest and homosexuality, or even between specifically Lamert and Lene's forbidden love and Rae's love for Claire that she believes will never be reciprocated.

Don't get me wrong, the books don't exactly condemn the relationship either and from what I've read ahead on the two do eventually come back (in very minor support roles), but all the sympathy Rae and Claire show is specifically through the context of how much they care about Lene. This includes the end of the arc when Lambert and Lene are sent into exile (they were originally going to be executed for treason but Rae and Claire managed to get the king to give them a reduced sentence in light of them being blackmailed and their family's long service to the kingdom). In the anime, when Rae is comforting Claire, she talks about how unfair the world can be, how ""We can't even love the one we want to"". And like before, there is no such line in the book. The focus is entirely on Rae comforting Claire, who despite all that had happened didn't want Lene, one of her oldest and closest friends, to leave and how sad it was that things don't always turn out the way people want. They are sympathetic to Lene, they don't judge or condemn her for being in a relationship with her sibling, they give her what they can to have a chance at a happy life wherever she'll end up, but it's all specifically because it's Lene, not because of however they feel about incestuous relationships. In fact in vol. 2 when a noble is craptalking the two traitors and their disgusting relationship, Rae's pissed off defense of them is only in regards to how they were blackmailed into committing treason. She doesn't comment at all on the relationship.

This isn't the worst change I've seen an anime do in an LN adaptation. Rising of the Shield Hero for example will always stand out to me because of how the anime for some bizarre reason decided to make Raphtalia not know what sex was and think that kissing was what made people pregnant. They basically made her weirdly innocent and childish when it came to sex, which made any potential future romance with Naofumi way creepier and with more of a power balance than it was already at risk of being because of the age difference and her initially being his slave, and naturally this was something that caused controversy because yeah, why the fuck wouldn't it?! Meanwhile, LN Raphtalia was well aware of what sex was (the village she grew up in even bred livestock for farming, so she knew how babies were made) and in fact the scenes where the anime had her being clueless and red-faced over the idea of Naofumi kissing her and making her pregnant, in the LN they're about Raphtalia reflecting on the fact that Naofumi is currently incapable of seeing her in any sort of sexual way because of how understandably traumatized he still is over being framed for sexual assault by someone he had trusted and been attracted to. You know, stuff that actually has her have some level of maturity and awareness.

While Lambert and Lene's relationship is nowhere near as relevant to ""I'm in Love with the Villainess"" as Raphtalia and Naofumi's is to ""Rising of the Shield Hero"", like the change to Raphtalia's character it is kind of weird that the anime would give Rae such lines that add a problematic element that wasn't originally there. Yeah, the incestuous relationship between these two side characters was there in the books but there was never any equivalence or parallel made between incest and homosexuality. It was part of the story but it wasn't made part of the story's themes.",False,anime,1707105069.0,1aj78bh

"i cant find my childhood anime anywhere, please help",Help,"edit: i found it! thanks guys <3

i used to watch tiji and teletoon all the time as a kid and lots of anime dubbed to french aired on it. there's a magical girl anime on it that took away my breathe but i CANT FIND IT :(

here's what i remember of it (spoiler duh):
main protagonist (pink. idk if her hair is too but she's pink lol) can travel to a different magic world with the help of some pet???? by the time she's back, time on earth has passed by only a second.
in the different world the ¬øqueen? is ¬ødead? so there's a school for the magic wielders  to learn about it, and at the end there's some sort of competition and the winner earns some very powerful thingy and becomes ruler??????

there's a purple genius girl, and a blonde rich bestie, a short snubby dude who's mom is never home (random fact to remember)

the protagonist has a crush on her earth classmate, BUT in the magic world there's an antagonist who looks JUST like him, turns out to be his twin sister and they're BOTH the queen's children. 

final thing i remember, in the competition 2 contestants from 2 different schools were asked to make a dress??? so the blonde rich girl makes one inspired from a droplet on water, made out of water.

it's not madoka magika, little witch academy, precure. it's probs before 2011 but not old enough to look 90's style.

The point is I‚Äôm really struggling to like the isekai genre and I‚Äôve so far dropped all the isekai anime I‚Äôve tried to give a chance to.

Why You Should Watch Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom,Watch This!,"I know, the title sounds like it's straight out of an emo teenager's diary, but don't let that discourage you from giving this amazing anime a shot! If you are interested in a more serious story with a great cast of characters or something a little different than most of the action anime that comes out nowadays and want to watch something a little darker then I highly recommend you give it a try!

&#x200B;

**Synopsis from** [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5682/Phantom__Requiem_for_the_Phantom)

Mafia is rife in America where assassinations are a regular occurrence on the streets. Inferno, a mysterious company, is behind most of these dealings through the use of their near-invincible human weapon, ""Phantom.""

One day, a Japanese tourist accidentally witnesses Phantom's latest murder. Desperate to escape, the tourist hides in a secluded building. However, Phantom, revealed to be a young woman named Ein, and the leader of Inferno ""Scythe Master"" captures the tourist and brainwashes him.

Given the name ""Zwei,"" this once peaceful tourist is now a puppet of Inferno with no memories. Drawn into a world of lies, deceit, and violence, Zwei must fight to survive, hopefully to one day regain his memories and escape from this world where he is constantly on the brink of death.

&#x200B;

**Production Values**

Despite being released in 2009, the animation still holds up surprisingly well. The action sequences are well-animated, and the overall visuals are pleasant to look at. Sure, the art style might seem a bit bland, but the background art is detailed and immersing enough to cover that up. The music is also a great thing about the series, some of the OSTs are also very experimental and unique! Here is the best OST from the series called  ""[Canzone of Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cR-E0oxn4)""

&#x200B;

In conclusion, Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is a hidden gem with a great story and characters and I highly recommend it",False,anime,1707149345.0,1ajk3ub

What anime got hated on because of real life?,Discussion,"As the title says, what are the anime that, due to something in real life, got hated on(justified or not) by people?

For example, I remember how much US audiences and reviewers tried to ignore or admitted to hate Police in a Pod because it showed the cops in a normal light while high profile cases of police brutality are/still are happening in the US. Another more specific example is that some audiences don't like how varying the personalities, reasonings and outcome of abusers in MHA are instead of just all of them being straight up monsters that deserved to get arrested or killed like most media tend to portray them due to their own experiences.",False,anime,1707146865.0,1ajj4rf

Characters you don't like but whose hate is overblown/out of proportion,Discussion,"Has there ever been a character you dislike but whose hate you feel like it's out of proportion, especially when it's to the point of wishing physical harm to them just for existing?

This one is no more apparent than Kazuya kinoshita from rent a girlfriend. Say what you will about him since most of the criticism i agree with, like his character constantly regressing which is mostly on reiji letting the shit drag out, but either way Kazuya is good example because half the time it feels like people are only hating on him because it's the popular thing to do before they find a next target and i never see them do it with the other cast members since they're not much better because they, like Kazuya do shitty things including but not limited to sexual assault. cough ruka cough.

As for me, i gave up reading it because of kazuya's family not giving a shit they were lied to for 2 straight years and chizuru, whose just as responsible for letting it go on ran away and only had kazuya do the talking. I gave up afterwards cause it wasn't worth getting mad at.

Also whats with the comparing him to characters like ayanokoji from classroom of the elite? I don't know, it's weird because they're two completely different characters and genres and ayanokoji is a sociopath despite him being one of my favorites. I get the chad characters comparison, but characters like ayanokoji are chad because of the context of their stories and a chad wouldn't fit the kind of story rent a girlfriend is.

One more thing that annoys me the most from the hate is how people always feel the need to keep bringing him up in things unrelated to him or romance in anything anime. Idk because most of it feels forced and are only there for upvotes and karma farming. I never subscribe to the idea of ""if you hate Kazuya, you're just like him"" because it's nonsensical and there's reasons to not like him, like his chizuru obsession, but nobody helps their case by getting that angry at a fictional character.

what takes Hulu so long to get the dubbing for anime?,Discussion,"i pretty much only watch anime in dub (only exception being the weekly releases of attack on titan and mushoku tensei). i used to only watch anime on Hulu, because that was the only streaming service i ever had

i would notice that for some shows, despite knowing it had a dub, would only have sub episodes. which confused me, especially for shows who‚Äôs dub had been out for a while. even now, my hero academia season 6 has been out for a long time, and hulu still doesn‚Äôt have all the episodes dubbed (i think), but other platforms do

is there a reason for this? i guess this question applies to other streaming services as well. on netflix, devil is a part timer didn‚Äôt get its dub for the longest time, despite the dub being out for a while (iirc)",False,anime,1707144499.0,1aji8a0
Anime where the protagonist was the driver of the show.,Discussion,"I just read a post asking for the least interesting protagonists, so I got curious which anime protagonists you felt drove the show. These characters put the ""pro"" in protagonist, not because they're competent, but because they DO feel like the center of the story. Not in the isekai powerfantasy sense, but who they are as people, how they push the plot and or even how they react to the things unfolding. They feel part of the story rather than just there as a guide for the audience. They scream ""now this is how you do a protagonist!"" 

They don't have to be brilliantly written (but that's ofc a plus), so long as you can feel they're the protagonist in a good way. Not in a plot armour sense. 

Some examples I can think of are Natsuki Subaru (Re:Zero), Rudeus Greyrat (Mushoku Tensei), Emiya Shirou (Fate/Stay Night), Mao Mao (Apothecary Diaries), Honda Tohru (Fruits Basket). These are some of the protagonists that I feel are feel engrained within the story and has a presence and leaves an impression. They're not boring cardboard cutouts. Even characters like Bocchi (Bocchi the Rock) can fit. I have more, but I want to hear you guys share too!

Ah, I'd be really cool if you can share why you feel they exemplify a great protagonist even if unorthodox. You can put someone like Makoto from School days if you like!.. Do people think he's a good protagonist? Genuinely curious.

Edit: I realize I put Rudeus Greyrat here subconsciously. Welp, can't help it. Whether you love or hate him, the story definitely does use him as a way to tell the story and he feels like a part of the world. ",False,anime,1707144472.0,1aji7x0
Was Isekai started in Japan?,Discussion,"So, I‚Äôm a huge fan of Isekai anime. I know it gets heavily watered down because of the ongoing bandwagon trend to jump on whatever is popular and release hundreds of animes around that style. I‚Äôm not really looking to discuss that. 

But, I was thinking about it. I mean the term Isekai is fairly new, but I think the idea of regular people being transported to a fantasy world is obviously not. Specifically I‚Äôm thinking back to the old Dungeons and Dragons cartoon of the 80s. Which then sparks the question, was the idea of this actually born in the western world? I‚Äôm not as familiar with Manga, particularly old manga and wondering if there‚Äôs some that would have the same type of story but predate this cartoon? 

(Side note: I know Alice in Wonderland and the Wizard of OZ maybe be considered these too, but I was more thinking along the lines of a person being transported to a fantasy world where they are then caught up in a hero‚Äôs quest with RPG or D&D-style stats.)",False,anime,1707144354.0,1aji6d7

These days every season is so stacked with anime.,Discussion,"I wonder if there were seasoned anime watchers out there like me. There are just so many shows to watch. I thought new season would be better but every season is like previous season.

I have been reading manga/ LN and watching anime for a long time. Every season it's like this:

# 1.Several manga/LN that I once read before got anime adaptations.

For example, in last season there are: Frieren, Dark Gathering. 

In this season: Still Frieren, The witch and the beast, Instant Death, Unwanted Adventurer, The Foolish Angel Dances with the Devil, 'Tis Time for ""Torture"" Princess.

# 2.Several anime with interesting premises.

This season: Sasaki and Peeps

# 3.Several rumored good manga that got anime adaptation .

last season, for example: The Apothecary Diaries.

This season: Dungeon Meshi

# 4.Next season I the anime I have watched.

For example, in last season there are: Spy x Family SS2, Eminence in Shadow ss2, Dr Stone New world part 2, Ragna Crimson part 2, DMDP part 2, JJK ss2. 

In this season: COTE ss3, Tsukimichi ss2, Blue Exorcist ss3, Bottom-Tier Tomozaki ss2

4 types of anime stacking up lead to me following at least 5 different anime of the season.

You know you won't stop because you love watching anime. If you stopped, the anime would stack up to next season and you would want to watch it anyway cuz you still kinda enjoy it. I could drop 3-4 shows, but in the end there are still many enjoyable ones.

Where did all these number from the video on Youtube come from?,Misc.," So according to this video on Youtube, ""soLo leVeLiNg BROkE The InteRneT"", but I have seen so little talk about it. The talk about it is almost non-existent in random subreddits. Random clips on Youtube are not even high views like anime below it like Frieren and JJK2. Nothing notable about meme section either. In fact, these past few months, the Lobotomy Kaisen just spreads everywhere like wildfire because fans went crazy and Frieren has Elf Feet + Cloth Melting Potion memes.

I saw Solo Leveling karma on this sub does not come even close to ""breaking internet"" and on MAL it's like 73k scorers with 400k members, while anime below Solo leveling like Frieren has 160k scorers with 500k members and JJK 2 with 370k scorers+ 820k members

Just where did this number come from?

It can be bad for the rest of the series (usually if the ending is good though most of the show is probably also good), just solely the ending.

anime for 8yo kids,What to Watch?,"hi everyone, i want to watch some anime with my little sister, at first i wanted to see the animes i used to watch but i found out that they sexualize some characters too much like one piece or dragon ball, i still find hard to find an anime that is appropriate for a little kid without any sort sexual references or sexualized bodies.

attack on titan is an anime that is 16+ but incredibly it was more appropriate for a little kid than one piece

"If it wasn‚Äôt Blue Exorcist, what was it?",Help,"Blue exorcist?

Years ago I watched an anime on Netflix and really enjoyed it. It was about a high school aged boy who worked as an exorcist and had blue flames from his hands and sword. I could‚Äôve sworn I watched and enjoyed Blue Exorcist. 

With the new season coming out, I went to rewatch it and it‚Äôs a whole different story. Completely. 

The one from years ago started with a girl traveling to school on a train and she sees a fight in the forest with a boy who takes on several bad guys or thugs in a fury of blue flame. She is in awe and then finds that same boy goes to her school, and wears gloves all the time. He is also absent a lot because of whatever work he does. She finds out his truth and tries to help him keep his secret identity.  There are other characters that are familiar to what‚Äôs on now like his brother and someone like Angel but they don‚Äôt go to school with him he only meets up with them when he goes to help in exorcist situations.

Campfire cooking in another world with my absurd skill for a non anime viewer,Discussion,"Hello!

For a bit of context, the only anime I've been able to consistently watch was Inuyasha, the rest I dropped because I wasn't enjoying them. If anything I'm more of a manga reader although recently I've only kept up with Dungeon Meshi and finished Umineko no naku koro ni.

I decided to give Campfire cooking a go as I like fantasy monsters and I like cooking. Let me preface this by saying I really enjoyed the different creatures and the dishes made with them looked delicious, and the show was overall enjoyable. However I don't understand...the point? 

Please don't come at me before I explain. I suppose there is animes where everything goes well and you ad a viewer are just witnessing a happy calm life but it felt weirdly empty in the sense of the main character doesn't experience any conflict during the whole show. He has a familiar that is able to destroy everything real quick, he has a barrier that shields him from everything, and he makes a crazy amount of money. When they present you with a new creature Fel just destroys it. To me the story didn't feel compelling at all (as there was no story), like, does he not want to go back to his world? How is he not surprised to be summoned? Plus no characters actually stick long enough to care.

I still did like to a degree the cooking but that was about it and I'd like to understand why this anime has such high praise (not coming for anyone that likes it, it's just that obviously not being much in this world I'm not too sure of what's expected of the genre)

And also: is there any other anime with a similar theme that has a more compelling story ir at least that has the MC overcome some hurdles? Don't recommend Dungeon Meshi as I'm up to date with the manga please üôè

Bocchi the Rock - Portrays anxiety as some crippling disease where you are not able to function at all. Anxiety in reality is a before and after thought primarily, however it can also be a strong ‚Äúduring‚Äù thought (class presentation comes to mind). Going to a meet up becomes 100x more stressful because you are contemplating completely irrelevant things from 100 different angles because anxiety. So many people were saying ""literally me."" I have powerful anxiety and I know it is variable depending on the person, but the Bocchi portrayal is not even semi realistic, even in the worst cases.

Frieren - I am a week to week watcher and think its fantastic, but the writing up to this point does not put it at an S tier level. It's rated higher than FMA:BH on MAL when the writing by ep 20 in FMA is worlds better and introduces much more creativity/world building/depth/plot. So far frieren is ""old elf that looks young has a strong love for magic, enjoys traveling with her party, and is trying to gain more spells. Also enjoys her companions company.""

JJK - Plot development < Fight with good animation. Don't really need to elaborate on this. Over half of S2 was dedicated to flashy fights with hardly any dialogue. A mix of both is necessity.

Also the main character that went evil had a scene with the other male character in which they were on top of a hill and they drew something.

I need help finding a fantasy anime/manga (can be isekai),What to Watch?,"
For starters there are types of anime I do like. For example there is

- dragon ball, and all the other dbz shows/movies 
- Fist of the North star 
- redo of healer 
- mashle 
- goblin slayer

Shows I dont like

-that time I got reincarnated as a slime 
- Mushoku Tensei 
- one piece 
- Re:zero

Types of anime I like are anime that have a good amount of fighting scenes, as well as a romantic subplot. I'm fine with fanservice, and don't like anime that have the demon king as a protagonist or ally.

I don‚Äôt know why I am making a big deal about it, but to me it‚Äôs just kind of interesting to see how such shows work regarding language barriers as lately I‚Äôve noticed that since a lot of Isekai shows take place in a medieval setting, the people in those worlds have no trouble understanding the protagonist, so my point being is that I was wondering if there was a show that had ever addressed that particular matter.",False,anime,1707093372.0,1aj3dtc

Cowboy Bebop - Anime of the Week,Weekly,"Welcome to the weekly Anime of the Week Discussion Thread! Each week, we're here to discuss various older anime series. Today we are discussing...

## Cowboy Bebop

Crime is timeless. By the year 2071, humanity has expanded across the galaxy, filling the surface of other planets with settlements like those on Earth. These new societies are plagued by murder, drug use, and theft, and intergalactic outlaws are hunted by a growing number of tough bounty hunters.

Spike Spiegel and Jet Black pursue criminals throughout space to make a humble living. Beneath his goofy and aloof demeanor, Spike is haunted by the weight of his violent past. Meanwhile, Jet manages his own troubled memories while taking care of Spike and the Bebop, their ship. The duo is joined by the beautiful con artist Faye Valentine, odd child Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV, and Ein, a bioengineered Welsh Corgi.

While developing bonds and working to catch a colorful cast of criminals, the Bebop crew's lives are disrupted by a menace from Spike's past. As a rival's maniacal plot continues to unravel, Spike must choose between life with his newfound family or revenge for his old wounds.

Bucchigiri MC needs development ASAP,Discussion,"Love Bucchigiri, every character besides the MC is great, the animation is stellar and the soundtrack goes hard.

"Searching for a movie (2010s, not anime (i think))",Help,"So, a bit of backstory: when I was little, my mother and I often went to the CD store to rent movies. This was long ago (and of course the shop closed, eventually). 
Here's the story, as close I remember it (I only rember scenes and a few other things): there is a boy, who's parents are dead and he lives with his godfather, there is also a samurai (note: this takes place in the modern world) and I think at some point the samurai (or the exact opposite idk) saves the child from an incoming train. 
The exactl next thing I remember is the villain and his army, and I remember this scene perfectly, the villain now stornger than ever, gets mad at a random soldier of his, levitates his soldier and starts breaking his spine.
That is all I remember. This move must have been from the 2010s, and it's style kinda reminds The Road to El Dorado.

***Gunpla is Freedom!***

**Questions of the Day:**

1) Now that we've seen all that the Gundam Build shows have to offer (other than Metaverse, which you can watch on your own), which *one* character is your favorite? How about your least-favorite?

2) Which entry is responsible for giving you the most of your favorite songs from all of these shows?

3) How do you rank each of the shows that we watched for this rewatch? If you've seen other Gundam shows, where do these rank amongst your favorites?

4) If you were in charge of making your own Gundam Build series, what would you have it be about, and what sort of Gunpla would you have the characters use?

5) What do you do at the end of the rewatch? Are you busy? Will you save me?

Why is Frieren so good and enjoyable ?,Discussion,"Frieren has been one of my favourite anime to come out in the 2020s but I just don't know why ? Besides the animation, music and some characters everything else feels average and even generic, especially the fantasy world, but it's still so good, I sit there after the episode trying to understand why did I enjoy it, I don't know how to explain it, they made a whole episode about Fern being ill and it was still so good, I don't know how or why but I can't complain.",False,anime,1707087461.0,1aj177o

How important are Opening and Ending songs for your impression of an anime?,Discussion,"As stated above, how do the songs chosen for particular anime, or an episode cour have an effect on your enjoyment, memory, or overall perception of it?

For me, I have noticed that if there is a good song attached to it, my attention is grabbed more easily, since I look forward to it and puts me in a good mood (especially important for me to follow weekly releases). Some personal and recent examples for this are Undead Unluck S1 op, Apothecary Diaries S1 op, Frieren S1 and S2 op and ed, and Jujutsu Kaisen Hidden Inventory Arc op.

On the other side, there are openings, like the Domestic Kanojo one, that I love, but can't seem to be enough to persuade me into liking the anime as a whole.
Others are songs like Blue Aoi, or the Durarara S1 opening, that instantly make me travel in time back to when I first watched them.

Edit: Thanks for all the replies! From what I've recollected the consensus is, for the most part, that it really does matter as an adjacent of the show, but not really being too influential in the enjoyment of it, however it can become an emotional hook for watchers after a long time. Sorry for the late replies! This has been some great insight and I'm excited to listen to the op/eds you've recommended!

i'm trying to find an anime with these sort of similarities to it:

\- set in college

\- really nice animation style

\- mature characters who make the plot happen, the plot does not happen to them

\- things move fast ish b/c no petty drama / lies / childish stuff like that

\- easy & cute watch but still a little serious

Is there an anime for me?,What to Watch?,"I grew up watching Naruto, Dragon ball, Bleach and also watched some others along the way such as Katekyo Hitman Reborn, Fairy tail, One Piece. However some time has passed and I wanted to comeback and watch I haven't yet explored. I very much enjoyed Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I also tried Hunter x Hunter, Attack on Titan, Black Clover and Demon Slayer which were recommended to me. The issue that I have, and I may not have this problem when I was younger, how stupid the characters are. They are almost  caricature. Main character that's an oaf, likes to eat, has no boundaries, is a loveable idiot, and wants to get stronger amongst many traits. I feel like most of the stuff is just recycled characters with different setting.    


Another thing - I get that anime is Japanese but some things are just to annyoing. Like the Zenitsu character from Demon Slayer. Or that characters seem to be ok with death, killing. There is always a 180IQ genius 12 year old that's been training martial arts he's been 3, because his parents abandoned him. It is a school / university but still ""kids"" are either taking things to seriously, are too violent... it just doesn't feel right for me. There's always a 'baka' girl, people beating up eachother for no reason. Hero has no life - only a goal to get stronger. This is abuse, not a training. You don't get good by practicing for 16h a day, running 10km and doing 100 push-ups. You make a mistake? Your mentor takes away your food etc.  


Another thing - that's a shonen thing nowadays but annoys me so much... Why does everyone have to have a special power? Like in first 2 Jojo chapters it was kind of cool but since the 3rd one each episode was basically scooby-doo'ing enemy stando. That's like the whole premise of Hunter x Hunter, Jojo, One Piece, later Naruto, later Bleach and the list goes on.   


So overall Attack on Titan was cool, although a bit too dark for me. Fullmetal alchemist was splendid. First two seasons of Jojo - great! I remember fondly Naruto but that might be nostalgia speaking. I think that I might be into Shonen but cannot tell.   


tldr; how do I find something that I may like?

Animes to watch outside of popular things?,What to Watch?,"I watched many of popular things like Mukoshu tensei, TenSura and so on, and have taste for power fantasy titles with OP MCs with little to no shortcomings. 

I have strong aversion for situations where writer wants to show ""weak humane characters"", ""fragile identities"", ""rough life"" and ""deep thoughts"". I'd rather look at ""bad, cliched and fan service"" title than ""award winning masterpiece""

The reason is i use anime to escape real life, not experience it. And ""deep thoughts"" is usually is not made properly, thus I often have quite rational and logical reasons to disagree with author, and I will never watch anything I strongly disagree with.  As I do ""smart things"" for life i don't even want to bother to figure out if I am agree or not with ""deep thoughts"" (because i was doing that for 8 hours straight 30 mins ago). 

So i'm asking for list of  ""bad"" small titles without much sense or pretentiousness to watch while being not fully in  consciousness . ",False,anime,1707079281.0,1aixxtw
Looking for anime name (again),Help,"I saw an anime in a recommendation video on YouTube at least a year ago and I can't find the anime or the video again.  It's about a main character who got reincarnated in a world where you are reborn as a mage and your power level scales with the years you spend as a virgin in the life before. The same goes for everybody else who gets reincarnated in the same world. I have no further information about this anime and know that there are a ton of reincarnated animes out there. What stands out in this one is the power level scaling with virgin years. 

I would appreciate any help in finding the name of this anime. Thanks in advance. ",False,anime,1707078345.0,1aixk3q

Usually isekais have a person who is unique with crazy mad skills and are respected as saviors of the New World. Usually transports are the only ones from Japan in the new world.

What does edgy actually mean?,Discussion,"This is a word I see thrown around a lot in the anime community, usually to describe characters but sometimes an entire anime, and I don‚Äôt really get what it means.

**QUESTIONS FOR THE SEMI-FINAL OVAs AND THE VERY FINAL MOVIE:**

1. **For those who read chapters 687-698 -** Were the scenes from Manga that have been omitted from Anime important to the overall story, or not at all?
2. Which scene from the Very Final Movie is your favourite?
3. Was the Very Final Movie a satisfying ending of Gintama? If no, what would you change to make the movie better?
4. Also the Very Final Movie received a new artstyle. Did you like the new artstyle for Final Movie, or no?
5. How do you feel about Takasugi‚Äôs portrayal during the final Gintoki‚Äôs fight with Utsuro? Was it confusing to you? After all, there were a weird shenanigans with Utsuro‚Äôs blood taking over the others. - Courtesy of

**QUESTIONS FOR POST SERIES DISCUSSION** ***FROM YOU FOR YOU!:***

That‚Äôs right, you read it correctly! Since one big part of Gintama is about meaningful relationships between Gintoki and his friends, and caring the burden together, I decided to let everyone add a one question that we will answer next week.

So take your time with your answers that you will post next week during the Post Series Discussion on **11th of February.**

# Now to the Questions for post series discussion:

Q1 - What was your favourite aspect of Gintama? Characters? Comedy? All of it?

Q2 - What do you do at the end of the rewatch? Are you busy? Will you save me?

Q3 - Since it took 10 years between the last successful Gintama Rewatch and this one, what is something you'd like to say to either the host or the watchers of the next one in 2034?

Q4A - **FOR FIRST TIMERS** - When did you realize that this show had an over-arching plot developing alongside all the jokes and which episode was ""The one"" that made you go, ""that's it, I'll watch it 'till the end""?

Q4B - **FOR REWATCHERS** - How did it feel watching the series with all the previous knowledge of the plot and watch the characters interactions develop?

Q5 - Without taking in consideration the existence of overarching story of Gintama that existence was a secret revealed in later arcs, how would you expect the Gintama to end if Gintama was only 100% toilet humor/slapstick/gag humour and other aspects of low comedy?

Q6A - How would you murder your rewatch host?

Q6B - What's your favourite shitpost from the show or rewatch?

Q7 - Are there any other rewatches you will be joining?

Q8 - What character did you change your opinion on the most over the course of the series and how?

Q9 - Did any of the many anime references in Gintama made you more interested in watching the referenced show?

Q10 - Gintama has a unique form of storytelling, where there is alot of episodic, unconnected episodes, with the serious arcs sprinkled in between. its not until later where we get more serious arc instead of episodic, comedy and meta episodes. So overall did this format work for you? Did the comedy always land? and was it ever a chore to get through?

Q11 - Did you have a favorite running gag? If so, what was it?

# BUT HERE IS A TWIST!!!

"What Have You Watched This Past Week That is NOT a Currently Airing Show? [February 4th, 2023]",Weekly,"Title says it all - talk about the anime you watched this past week that are not a part of this Winter 2024 season (like **Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun 2nd Stage** or **Dungeon Meshi**), or a show that's continuing from previous seasons (like **Sousou no Frieren**).

With regards to Fall 2023 shows, however, it would be fine to write about them as long as you only began them after they finished airing. For example, it's fine to talk about watching **The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You** or **Arknights: Perish in Frost** if you started them after the final episode aired. Obviously, use your best judgement on this.

**Please use spoiler tags**; it's super simple stuff. An example below:

        [KonoSuba Ep 9] >!""THIS WAS A VERY BAD EPISODE, DARKNESS DID NOT DESERVE THAT!<

Kemono no Souja Erin really hit me,Discussion,"I watched the 50 episode long series recently after putting it off for many years due to a bias against the older style visuals I saw in episode 1. I have to say I kind of don't regret it because watching it at my current late 20s age really let me get a lot out of it.

The transition of the MC from childhood through major life stages and the constant shift in the groups of people she is around felt very real to me. It reminded me a lot of how people drift around in my actual life and how I shouldnt take it for granted that certain people will just be around.

The world building and politics were shockingly rich as well, it din't feel like those constant cookie cutter settings you see in a lot of isekai fantasy these days. Ryoza legitimately feels like a unique setting with its own customs, culture, animals and vegetation.

The old time aesthetics actually gave me a strong nostalgic vibe as well, it's not overly shiny and bright like modern anime and the characters look a little less attractive. But the world feels so much more real and the fantasy creatures that the MC takes care of as a fantasy world veterinarian come across as especially majestic and otherworldly.

I did have some problems with the pacing and how abruptly the ending was pushed on the audience after dragging the last arc for 5 episodes longer than it should have been, but overall I got to say this was one amazing watch.",False,anime,1707067528.0,1ait5or

Where did the Pink-Blue-Yellow magical girl color scheme come from?,Discussion,"This has been eating away at me for about a year now, but with a new season of Precure upon us and a less family-friendly magical girl show that's making the rounds this season (one could say people are *gushing* over it), I figured I should ask.

If you've never seen a magical girl show before, you've still probably seen these colors. The classic magical girl triplet of the pink lead with her blue and yellow companions shows up anywhere if you want to make a magical girl reference (unless you're *Weathering With You* and want to make a real deep cut). It's synonymous with the genre at this point, but my only remaining question is where did it come from? 

I know pink leads are about as old as color in this genre, and the tried and tested use of the three primary colors for products aimed at kids is probably just as long (see why the original Gundam is colored the way it is), but when this iconic color scheme became the goto for magical girl triads is a little harder to pinpoint. The two biggest works from the 90s era (*Sailor Moon* and *Cardcaptor Sakura*) didn't use it (the latter also only focusing on a singular magical girl) and other similar magical girl( or magical girl-esque) shows from the time like *Magic Knight Rayearth* and *Tokyo Mew Mew* also narrowly avoid the scheme. My next guess would be Precure given that franchise's ubiquity, but Precure arguably didn't adopt the full scheme until 2010 with *Heartcatch Precure* (2009's *Fresh Precure* sort of adopts it, but with a blonde pink lead instead of the ""traditional"" pink hair). However, not even a year after *Heartcatch*, *Madoka Magica* would use the scheme as its pseudo-default magical girl palette, and I doubt 2010 was just teeming with so many *Heartcatch Precure* clones that the scheme became the default. The closest lead I can find is 1999's *Magical Doremi* which featured Pink, Blue, and (Yellow-ish) Orange, but information online about this topic is scarce (or hard to search for) so its hard to lock this one in as the definitive answer.

Admittedly, I'm still rather new to the world of magical girls, so I'm hoping someone with a little more experience with the genre could enlighten me on the matter, or (if there wasn't just one series to attribute it to) how this scheme eventually came to be so dominant...

[I mention Heartcatch Precure, but even that one had a fourth purple Cure added later in the run so...](https://preview.redd.it/iac1ektkjlgc1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff4d1c122ba0e26a26fc337ad17c89fe1fbc43ae)",False,anime,1707064681.0,1ais0iu
Mob Psycho 100 is sublime. What to watch next?,What to Watch?,"Just finished it yesterday and I have to say it was way more than I expected it to be when I started watching.

"You should watch/read ""Undead Unluck""",Discussion," So I started reading Undead Unluck a few days ago cause I was too impatient for the anime, and at around 100 chapters now I have to say, it has been an amazing decision. Undead Unluck has one of the most interesting plots involving characters with superpowers.

The art is amazing, the characters are fun, the fights are great and the story is exciting, The world-building is detailed and one-of-a-kind. The whole manga reminds me of why I like unique power systems and characters who use those powers in creative ways. The story never loses its pacing and always has a way of engaging you, that is also one of the reasons why JoJo's is one of my favorite manga of all time. The parts of the story that concern the whole world also remind me of the world-ending events in Jojo's, so if you love JoJos, Chainsaw Man or JuJutsu Kaisen, you will also love Undead Unluck

So I'm kinda disappointed that the anime isn't able to gain as much traction as other big shows because this show does deserve to be bigger. So if you haven't watched/read Undead Unluck, you should give it a try, It's a great action-adventure-comedy story, It's story about the quest to find the greatest death possible.",False,anime,1707054942.0,1aiof17

**2. Madoka magica** ‚Äì same studio as the previous one so the animation is geart, really amazing story, it's very unique take.

March comes in like a lion was great but‚Ä¶,Discussion,"Shogi still seems kind of boring. Whenever they were playing shogi with a few exceptions i was generally kind of bored.

Of course if i knew how to play shogi maybe that would change a bit. I know its supposed to show Rei growing and changing as a person but i like the show more when it focused on the sisters and the side characters interacting with him. As well as the sisters story in season 2.

I know ppl love this show so my rating at least for the first season will probably receive some backlash. I go by mal scores so a 7/10 is good, a 9/10 is great.

Season 1: 7/10 
Season 2: 9/10

I almost dropped the show towards the middle/end of the show around episode 16 for season 1 but hearing how great season 2 was made me push through it a bit more. Im glad i did because season 2 was great but i think if i hadnt already been well acquainted with slower anime i probably wouldve dropped it. 

The first half of season 1 was pretty good but the middle got boring, idr much of the end of season 1. Im trying to keep this spoiler free for the most part so my answers are kind of vague. I put season 1 on hold for a couple months around episode 16 tho so my memory of season 1 is kind of vague. Started season 1 like 6 months ago, started season 2 like a month ago.

Tldr: The sisters were great I dont think there was a part of the show I disliked when they were there, His past and his stepsister were interesting, The teacher and the fat kid shogi player were cool, the shogi was done pretty well but my attention span is trash so it was mostly boring to me.

 Overall i recommend it, not as a first anime but if u have watched a decent amount like 20-30 that aren‚Äôt just action animes u would probably enjoy it. Hope they make a season 3 eventually.",False,anime,1707051890.0,1aingb0

Looking for an old anime on netflix,Help,"As title states. I wont be able to help much as its been years, but the anime starts with like a main group training with dinosaurs they summon, at a dojo. Things happen and the first ""villian"" loses his memory and helps the protags for a while before a bigger bad-guy shows up",False,anime,1707042513.0,1aikz98
Violet Evergarden is a masterpiece,Discussion,"I just finished watching the 13 episodes of the main anime and am blown away by how beautiful and emotional this anime was. I am ashamed that I originally wrote this anime off when it initially aired after only watching one episode. Finally years later I decided to give it another chance because I've seen it mentioned positively several times on this sub.

The story telling, setting, animation, characters, and music are all so beautiful. This anime starts off slow but by the second half, each episode is full of emotions and makes you really feel sad for Violet and the people she encounters. I haven't cared about a protagonist this much in a long long time. I love how Violet was written from being an emotionless killing machine to a very sweet and emotional woman who wants to find the most important person in her life and find closure.

I highly recommend this anime for anyone who wants a change of pace and to experience an truly beautiful story. I plan on watching the 2 movies next after this and if anyone knows of similar animes, please recommend them.

What are your thoughts on the production committee system? Are there any other successful alternatives to producing an anime?,Discussion,"A main advantage of the production committee system is that it enables various companies to minimize the risk of producing and financing an anime. 

A main disadvantage is that even if the anime does well, the profits are to be split; not evenly depending on who financed more into the production. 

___

But these are points as it relates to the sponsors. What about as it relates to the contractors and subcontractors - i.e the animation studios?

For example, in this [Animator Dormitory video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=O2yLGjCz_JM), Ryoko stresses the root of the anime industry wage crisis is due to the production committee system. She claims the system ‚Äústructurally keeps production costs low‚Äù and references to this [video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZUwlwQj40VI&t=0s) as to why. 

A few points made in this other video are:

* production committees do not give enough budget to the animation studios.

* production committees do not ‚Äúallow animators to benefit from the royalties‚Äù after the studio(s) contract are done. I think this especially applies to committees where the animation studio is not on the committee.

* to the above point, royalties would really only be given to ‚ÄúDirectors, scenario writers, and similar roles‚Äù and not to the majority of the animators.

* If one company wants to raise the animation budget for the animation studio, all other companies would have to be on board.

They claim optimizing workflows with digital technologies or AI would help both animation studios and the committee; at the same time, I just feel like that makes production committees try to expect the anime to be made faster and cheaper and to justify a lower budget in the future. 

Especially when you look at Kadokawa‚Äôs quarterly reports and how they want to increase the number of anime they produce every year, I can‚Äôt help but think animation studios will suffer more.

At the same time, just how much can production companies finance? Would they be able to turn a profit if they increased the anime budget by 3x  to account for animator pay - as in the $ / cut animators earn is 3x more? 

We envision these companies to be greedy, but can they actually give a manageable budget in the first place? Even with the production committee system which is designed to minimize risk, it seems profits still do not turn out all that well all the time.

The scene was almost completely black with a scary cat-like or demon face. I think it was a fight and I think the characters were mostly all red or maybe even just outlines. It was sort of trippy and used a lot of perspective shots where the characters face was closer to the camera.

"Girls of r/anime, what are some actually well-written female characters?",Discussion,"*Everyone‚Äôs allowed to chime in with their opinions, but I mainly care about what the girlies think. 

Recently I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about how I struggle to name more than a handful of well-written female characters in anime. So I tried to look up articles and other subreddits but it was obvious that most of these opinions belonged to men. Of course I‚Äôm not saying men can‚Äôt have an opinion on this, but I‚Äôm more interested in hearing other women‚Äôs opinion. If I‚Äôm being honest, it‚Äôs not only disappointing but also somewhat alarming to see the female characters that some (but often many) men deem well written, as they‚Äôre usually not. 

Personally, I think that Jolyne from JoJo‚Äôs part 6 is one of the best female characters in anime, but I also really like Maka (Soul Eater), Morgiana (Magi), Asa (Chainsaw Man) and all the Studio Ghibli girls of course. I‚Äôm also currently watching Nana and I absolutely love the female characters. 

I would love to hear everyone‚Äôs opinion and hopefully get some inspiration on new anime as I‚Äôm dying too see some good female representation.

*EDIT: I should have specified that I don‚Äôt usually watch romance/ slice of life anime. I‚Äôm aware that there are many great female characters in these anime genres that cater specifically to women. I guess my issues is that in most anime that don‚Äôt solely cater to women, well written female characters are far and few between (e.g. main stream anime, seinen, action/ adventure, psychological, thriller etc) 

**EDIT: I‚Äôm very sorry if I ever came off as rude when replying to anyone.

Bocchi the review...by me.,Writing,"I've always been into music anime since watching love live. Hearing the sounds and lyrics from a different part of the world is always fun. Not to mention seeing really cool people come together and make magic happen. That's what I saw while watching bocchi the rock. An anime that took the community by storm and is still popular to this day. It has style, comedy, interesting characters and most of all cool music. The story starts with the titular character bocchi gotoh trying to make friends. But unfortunately for her, finding popularity as an introvert is pretty hard. 

She can't talk to anyone without freaking out. And would literally turn to ash before being that extroverted party animal. But thankfully for her; she picks up a guitar as a way to express herself. After years and years of practice (due to her having nothing else to do) she becomes a virtuoso. So much so that she starts her own YouTube channel and racks up a hefty subscriber count. But unfortunately, loneliness still pulls at her no matter what she does to cope. So one day in an attempt to make some friends, she brings her guitar to school. Hoping that someone will find it interesting and talk to her. 

Sadly she doesn't get any bites, until she meets a blonde girl named nijika ijichi. Who begs her to join her group after a fallout with another guitar player. Bocchi tags along, fighting off a mental meltdown along the way. It's then that she's introduced to the world of Rock n roll through various clubs and eccentric people. Not just that, but we get to see her start what comes to be known as kesoku band. The world of bocchi is what really brought this show to life for me. As everyone is so colorful and filled with a unique swagger that makes them stand out.

Take nijikas older sister Seika for an example. She's the cool and collected owner of a club called starry. A hole in the wall locale where underground bands play for their audiences. It's here she puts bocchi and her friends to work. Letting them earn money to rent out venues while at the same time learning by watching different bands. You gotta love a tsundere type character who is hard on the outside. But on the inside she just wants this young group of rockers to be ready. Between that and her always taking care of her little sister, it's no wonder why she's a personal fave. 

One that I don't care for is Ryo, the blue haired bassist of kesoku band. She comes off as a quiet and more reserved type, but that's just a cover up. She's really a bumming leech that wants to take advantage of all her friends. I mean seriously, she tries to take from poor bocchi every chance she gets. Whether it's making her buy food for advice or suggesting different restaurants knowing she has no money. I mean she's just terrible, she refuses to pay anyone back. And I just can't believe the group puts up with such a horrible person. I'm sorry to people who like her, I just think she's freaking sorry!

Speaking of horrible people, now ill talk about my absolute favorite character. Hiroi kikuri, the bassist and singer of a more experienced group sick hack. A band that is absolutely huge in the underground scene. But sadly the group can't find much success due to their singer being a full fledged alcoholic. Hiroi to me is absolutely adorable, and helped bocchi beat some of her fears. She also helped her sell tickets to kesoku band's first performance. But the people around her definitely wouldn't agree with me. As she bums folks for money to get wasted, passes out in different locations. And even damages the venues where she plays; causing her to be pretty broke. Not to mention the fact that she has some serious issues going on in her head. 

One's that she'd rather drown with alcohol than face on her own. And if you read her spin off manga by the same author, you'll learn a lot more about her. And I hate to say it, but I've been absolutely loving kikuris manga. Maybe even more than bocchi and the gang's story. I guess I'm one of those types that believes I could fix her problems. 

The animation in this show was absolutely fantastic. Not being too serious and having some hilarious moments. But at the same time being one of the most visually stunning shows out now. You could tell the studio made this with plenty of love. It's really needless to say that the music was awesome. From the opening and ending credits to the music in the show. This one really took the cake when it came to catchy tunes. I definitely recommend looking up sick hacks song watashi dake yuurei, as it is totally fire. In fact I wish they would release an entire album instead of just one song.

The show has thirteen episodes and I hear it's getting a movie. While there's no dub, the voice actors really do a good job bringing everyone to life. The issues it tackles pertaining to loneliness and making friends really hit home with me. I can relate to bocchis struggles to try and fit in; it's not easy out there. As I am a person who doesn't get out much but would probably benefit from a group like kesoku band. So if you want an anime that has cute girls doing awesome things. And a show that can teach you a thing or two about making friends. Then check out bocchi the rock, an award winning anime that has made itself a staple in this community of lonely weebs.",False,anime,1707014062.0,1aid8my
