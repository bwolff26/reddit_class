Having trouble finding Anime to watch with my Gf who's new to anime,"I started her with Death Note cause she loves murder mystery and detective stuff, but I'm having some trouble finding out what else to introduce her to. She has physical tics, so she would prefer less intense Anime, but this isn't a deal breaker. A couple things she really doesn't enjoy are over the top gore and violence to animals. She also would rather watched dubbed cause she has trouble watching and reading and says the Japanese voices are hard to listen to (I think she's wrong on this part but can understand the reading and watching point. 
She is open to finding some romantic/love stories and obviously would enjoy some detective or murder mystery stuff. Thanks in advance for any recommendations!",False,manga,1705894161.0,19cm3ep

My Thoughts on season 1 of hibike euphonium.,"These are my thoughts on season 1 without the OVA.

I cant tell if Kousaka and Kumiko are just becoming great friends or what tbh. Kousaka said she likes the teacher but when then they hangout they can get very intimate lol. The festival date or whatever that was felt like it was leading towards something. 

Whenever Kousaka is around it doesnt seem like normal friends hanging out lol. Im pretty sure one of them said i love you to each other but i could be misremembering. And u can love a friend.

I cant tell which way its going or if there is even gonna be romance lol. I dont want any spoilers about this but it would be cool to know if there is romance in the show at all in later seasons/movies?

The visuals of this show are amazing which is kinda what drew me in as well as season 3 being announced. Kyoto animation op. It had been on my list for a while but i decided to start it after asking about it and its great watching it on a large tv. I usually watch anime on my phone but this show seems so much better on a big screen.

I havent watched much music anime so i dont really have much to compare it to. Unless you count bocchi the rock i think this is the only music focused anime ive actually completed.

I dont really know much about band and have had no interest in it. I still dont have much interest in it but the show is good enough to make me want to keep watching.

Overall i think season 1 was very good and id give it an 8/10. I plan on continuing it tho i tend to not be in the mood for anime movies so not sure if ill be caught up before spring when season 3 comes. The opening and ending song are great as well.

Curious on how yall viewed season 1 compared to me as well? No spoilers pls tho beyond what i asked.",False,manga,1705892710.0,19clmrv

How do I fill the void after Attack on Titan?,"I finally finished Attack on Titan, and I am in ruins! I hadn’t been that captivated by a show since I watched Death Note. The amount of expert foreshadowing, sheer attention to detail, the countless threads that masterfully all connect, the constant reinterpretation of old details, the compelling characters, plot line, world building, etc.

In my current state it’s hard for me to believe I’ll be able to quite match the immaculate storytelling of AoT, lol, but I am willing to give a shot to any shows you think are on the same caliber or (dare I say it) better?

Looking for a romance anime that doesn't immediately after the love interests finally get together,"So many romance animes spend the entire series with the two main love interests dancing around confessing to each other. Then they finally confess to each other at the end and get together and that's cool and all.

But I'm looking for a romance anime where they spend a significant amount of time dancing around confessing to each other, but it doesn't end immediately after the confession. Maybe like one or two seasons pre-confession but also has one or two additional seasons post-confession.

The closest example I can think of to this would be Kaguya-sama. Now, I know that's kind of a weird example because as of right now, [Kaguya-sama spoilers] >!the anime literally ends right exactly where Kaguya and Shirogane start dating, which is pretty much the opposite of what I'm looking for. But if you take into account the manga, them beginning to date is pretty much just the halfway point of the story. And I'm sure that the rest of the manga will be adapted eventually.!<

Nisekoi - Anime of the Week,"Welcome to the weekly Anime of the Week Discussion Thread! Each week, we're here to discuss various older anime series. Today we are discussing...

## Nisekoi

Raku Ichijou, a first-year student at Bonyari High School, is the sole heir to an intimidating yakuza family. Ten years ago, Raku made a promise to his childhood friend. Now, all he has to go on is a pendant with a lock, which can only be unlocked with the key which the girl took with her when they parted.

Now, years later, Raku has grown into a typical teenager, and all he wants is to remain as uninvolved in his yakuza background as possible while spending his school days alongside his middle school crush Kosaki Onodera. However, when the American Bee Hive Gang invades his family's turf, Raku's idyllic romantic dreams are sent for a toss as he is dragged into a frustrating conflict: Raku is to pretend that he is in a romantic relationship with Chitoge Kirisaki, the beautiful daughter of the Bee Hive's chief, so as to reduce the friction between the two groups. Unfortunately, reality could not be farther from this whopping lie—Raku and Chitoge fall in hate at first sight, as the girl is convinced he is a pathetic pushover, and in Raku's eyes, Chitoge is about as attractive as a savage gorilla.

Nisekoi follows the daily antics of this mismatched couple who have been forced to get along for the sake of maintaining the city's peace. With many more girls popping up his life, all involved with Raku's past somehow, his search for the girl who holds his heart and his promise leads him in more unexpected directions than he expects.

> Maybe it's the lack of proper technology education but most kids I've met these days are totally lost when it comes to computers.

> Lack of education and lack of experience.

Now you just tap an icon on your iPad and everything loads in from the Cloud.

* Do you believe that the morbidly online Ojisan is any different from the three knights members we met? If there is a difference, please point it out. 
* This is probably a little late in the watch to ask, but now that you know Lain's definitely got different personalities, so you personally interpret Lain of the Bear Onesie and Lain of the Onee-chan different or is it just Bear Onesie Lain acting like a normie girl on purpose?

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!"" 

JustAnswerAQuestion scored a retroactive Abyssbringer prompt from a previous rewatch lol

> Is there a shared reality? Is your red the same as my red? Do you exist? Do I exist?

> Most people who are not philosophers would generally agree that there is a single reality that we all share. But for a few intermittent forays into hallucinogenic drug use, this has been true for all history. But if augmented-reality is universally deployed, that breaks down. The kids are worshiping a Lain-in-the-Sky that, at first, no-one else can perceive. With AR, nobody can be assured that another shares their perception. The common ground that underlies society collapses.

#[**Yesterday's Prompt!**](https://imgur.com/a/47MTj0Q)

#[**Tomorrow's Prompt**](https://imgur.com/a/dUCpL5V)

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      

This ends up being a combo between Tarhanlindur, Vaadwaur and Esovan13 about the concept of ""walk in"" 
> You can download something into Mika's body, possibly even an earlier copy of Mika. A corpse is worm food, for good and ill.

> Note that this is not necessarily a good thing.  (You may already know this, IIRC Dion Fortune goes into this somewhere, but the concept is called a walk-in in occultism circles.  The lore is that sometimes this is another human soul, but unfortunately sometimes it can be something much more malevolent...)

>The walk in concept I’ll have a hard time forgetting as it ended up playing a critical role in The X-Files in what was and still is one of the worst resolutions to a storyline I have ever seen.

Before it came out though many people were saying it was amazing and saying it was a great adventure anime comparable to frieren. So far though it mostly seems like a gag comedy along the lines of helck or mashle(both of which I enjoyed more at this point). I guess what I'm really asking is does the genre of the anime shift later on?

What anime characters motivate you?,"Through out my time of watching anime I often find myself admiring certain characters. I’ll begin to wish I could become like them in their differing characteristics. It motivates me so much watching certain characters kick a$$, defeat against all odds, learn and build their skills as much as possible, preserve even in the worst of situations, and stay positive and caring towards others around them. I love that about anime, that they can have such depth to the characters and their development and can convey such emotion that I can empathize and admire them. Characters that come to mind when I think of this are Chise from The Ancient Magus Bride, her perseverance and her dedication to helping others no matter if it puts her in danger. MaoMao from Apothecary Dairies, her wit and hunger for knowledge. Rishe from 7th Time Loop. Sawako from Kimi Ni Todoke. Yuji Itadori from jjk. Tanjiro Kamado from Demon Slayer.

Should i rewatch one piece/continue from where ive stopped?,"Hey guys i need help deciding this.  So ive watched till the luffy starts fighting kaido. I dont remember the episode number. I stopped watching cause till then i was binging it and i didnt want to wait each week for an episode and decided to start again after the wano arc had ended. Now the arc has ended im thinking if i should start from the begining. But i just saw a reel of someone calculating the time actually needed to watch 1000 episodes and it hit me that maybe that many episodes is a bit long.  
So im here asking your opinion should i rewatch it/ continue from where ive stooped/ start from the begining of wano arc/ or just read the manga (also im  afraid that ill miss out on the ost, incredible voice acting and funny moments if i go manga)
And i do have some free time right now and ill probably skip forward some parts(not enire episode ) and fillers. Also the recaps op and ed. So that would shave of some time.",False,manga,1705864928.0,19cbad5

"What Have You Watched This Past Week That is NOT a Currently Airing Show? [January 21st, 2023]","Title says it all - talk about the anime you watched this past week that are not a part of this Winter 2024 season (like **Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun 2nd Stage** or **Dungeon Meshi**), or a show that's continuing from previous seasons (like **Sousou no Frieren**).

With regards to Fall 2023 shows, however, it would be fine to write about them as long as you only began them after they finished airing. For example, it's fine to talk about watching **The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You** or **Arknights: Perish in Frost** if you started them after the final episode aired. Obviously, use your best judgement on this.

**Please use spoiler tags**; it's super simple stuff. An example below:

5. Question more suited for [u/b0bba\_Fett](https://www.reddit.com/user/b0bba_Fett/) who said that Shinpachi character was underused during the Silver Soul arc. - Did Shinpachi being a last line of defense against Utsuro changed your opinion on him, or no?
6. **FOR FIRST TIMERS -** Utsuro was denied by everyone, he jumped in Altana and now there is 2 years timeskip. *IS THAT IT? WHAT ABOUT THE REMAINING 6 EPISODES, 2 OVAs, and Final Movie?* Well my question is, what’s your final prediction for the remaining 8 episodes (6+2) and Final Movie that will cover last 34 chapters?

Looking for Anime with good English dubs husband will watch...,"Ok, so I watch a lot of anime. I tend towards lighter, fluffier ones, (think *Recovery of an MMO Junkie* or *Spy Family*) but also some action-y ones--honestly, I watch just about anything though I'm not a super fan of stuff like *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure*. My son and I watch a lot together (My New Boss is Goofy, Wotakoi, Kakuriyo, Norigami, etc.). However, I usually only watch things that are subbed as most dubs just drive me nuts as the VAs in English never seem as good. I have never been able to get my husband to watch any as he hates to watch anything with subtitles (he won't touch a Kdrama with a barge pole). Anyway, he actually suggested and watched Blue Eye Samurai with me and he really liked it. BUT he still won't watch anything subbed. ONLY English dubs.

WOW Dorohedoro is amazing.,"I decided to watch it a week ago and now I wonder why I didn't watch it before. 

The world of *Dorohedoro* is unlike any other I've seen before, the world has got sorcerers with the weirdest of magic I've seen and the creepiest of characters, I mean there are zombies in of of the episode and somehow it all makes sense. 

First time in a long time I didn't hate a single character form Caiman to En I liked every character, one of the character named Ebisu is an absolute crackhead throughout the season and I love it. You would think you've seen it all until you watch the next episode.

From the plot to the worldbuilding everything has been amazing and fun. Give it a go if you haven't till yet, more people need to talk about *Dorohedoro*

Season 2 has been announced, very excited to see more of it.",False,manga,1705845136.0,19c3uty

What’s everyone’s top 5 anime? And why?,"Mine are for different reasons, but they all lead back to having a special place in my heart.


1 - Fairy Tail -
It holds a very special place in my heart for being the first bigger anime I ever watched. I love the over all story and being able to fallow the characters that I love dearly in their journey. Are some parts/story arcs better than others, most definitely so, but that doesn’t change my overall love for this anime.


2 - Dr. Stone -
This anime has a vicious grip on my emotional state some days. It makes me cry so easily, like listening to the op/end songs alone can make me ball my eyes out. There’s not a character I dislike in this entire anime, I absolutely love them all in their own different way! Do I have my favorites, of course I do, but every character is written so well in my opinion that I can’t dislike any of them. It’s other one of those anime where I love watching the characters journey into the new world. Bonus points for the amazing soundtrack!


3 - Maid-Sama! -
This one holds the number three spot mostly because it was my first ever anime and I have great memories of watching it as a kid, it holds a dear spot in my heart for that alone.


4 - Wolf Children - (yes a movie not a show).
This movie holds a place in my heart for how many different emotions it made me feel at such a young age, and still does to this day. It was also the first ever anime I watched with my mother, which is a very found memory for me.


5 - Yuri on Ice!!! -
The first ever lgbt related anime I watched. It can still make me cry to this day, especially the ending song. I remember this being an anime that when my dad found out what was in it he told me not to be watching it, but I watched it  anyway. I did however stop somewhere in the middle though and never actually finished it until about a year or so later (not because of my dad but because I got distracted with other stuff). Absolutely loved it in its entirety, and it was my I’m gonna watch it anyway show.


So there’s my top 5 and the reasons why! What’s yours?",False,manga,1705828318.0,19bzglc

The use of cuss words is also a really breathe of fresh air in the limited anime that I've watched. It's one of those anime that are on par with the sub and I personally prefer the english dub over the japanese.

Dungeon Meshi is actually really good?!!,"Ok so yo... I don't like food. I don't like cooking. I don't usually even really like comedic fantasy. So I did NOT think I would enjoy this show. But after watching it...

I like what they're cooking.

&#x200B;

Ok, pun aside, this show has seriously surprised me. The humor is on point, and the worldbuilding is actually top notch so far. The dungeon really feels ALIVE, and rather than trying to go out of its way to explain it's mysteries to you through a whole introductory exposition dump, the show instead feeds you information about how its world operates through what's relevant in the storytelling. It's actually very captivating and has me looking forward to what they're going to cook up next.

Wonderful first three episodes. Give it a chance if you haven't already.",False,manga,1705805999.0,19btfb5

Looking for something good in English dub,"So I’m no longer a newbie in the anime space after a little over a year watching but idk what my “taste” is yet. 

I’m looking for something “new to me”  so here are my top anime’s at the moment 

One piece 

Vinland saga (especially season 2) 

Black clover 

Theses are my top 3 at the moment I’ve recently watched jujitsu Kaiszen and mashvile mussels  and magic and demon slayer (and no I’m not looking up how there actually spelled) theses are ok solid 7’s in my book with the weakest link being  mashvile at around a 5.5 for me. 

I think I’m looking for something a bit more grounded like Vinland saga but my biggest thing are characters that have a bit more depth and character exploration like one piece and Vinland saga 

I’m thinking about watching Attack on titan but I watch anime at night while I’m going to sleep and think it might be a bit too intense. 

Any recommendations?",False,manga,1705802587.0,19bsbt6

 So far my favorites have been:

#1. One Punch Man ( I love the quirky dry humor and irony. I'm also obsessed with cyborgs/robots)

#2. Death Note ( the dark and sinister vibe with thrilling twists and mystery, the k*nky undertones) 

#3. Chainsaw Man ( The raunchy humor paired with solid storytelling and captivating action)

#4. Dragon Ball ( inappropriate and offensive humor, nostalgic classic, innocent) 

#5. The Promised Neverland ( creative and thrilling dark storyline, captivating) 

I didn't care for Attack On Titans or My Hero. Tower of God was okay. I watched all of Demon Slayer so far but who hasn't. I love Jujutsu Kaisen but haven't finished it because I save it for special circumstances/persons.

* Praise the Lain!! 
* If our rewatch group got together one day to say our prayers to the sky, what do you suppose would appear? 
* Would you have preferred Mika to die than be left in her current state? 
* Seeing how the Cunny Killer Doctor is living a fairly pleasant retirement, what are your thoughts on the idea of being linked to a dream machine during our end of life care? Is it too humane? Or perhaps too inhumane? I know it's a sore subject for some people so feel free to skip this if you're not comfortable discussing the topic. 
* We've finally been formally introduced to ""Lain of the Wired,"" say something nice about her~

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!""

> # TꟼMOЯꟼ

> Lain witnesses Mika fully losing her grip on reality here. I've speculated before that she has a similar disorder to Lain which is why she seems to be the most aware of Lain's hallucinations, and I think Lain's condition steadily deteriorating primed her for a complete breakdown with the right trigger- the weird message written on the cult napkins. That moment sent Mika into a mental spiral and she came out differently on the other side, leaving her sanity on the doorstep, as it were

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      

Unfortunately my own post was a bit too spoilery to put in the actual post body but we got many interesting interpretations, including this one from DegenerateRegime! 
> Here's one way of looking at it, though I don't consider it to be the truth: when she says to Lain ""I saw you earlier,"" Lain has no memory of this - she was fully spaced out at the time and only remembers being on the Wired all day. So, she imagines a whole narrative where she manifested on a screen, somehow, that would explain Mika's *meaningful* comment. In this narrative, Mika behaves like Lain imagines she would, ie more like Lain herself does (Lain's theory of mind may not be in the best shape). When the narrative collides with reality, Lain sees a hallucinatory image trying to continue it briefly before fading. The issue with such ""explanations"" is that they're too powerful; *anything* can be explained by them, making them uninteresting (cf ""it was all a dream"").

Common sense or smart mc,"So since the new year  my fyp is flooded with op from season 2 of mashle. And I decided to give this anime a try.

I can kind of understand why Makoto Shinkai sticks to his formula due to Lost Voices,"I mean I’ve seen most of his films aside from the new one, but lately I was looking back at his movies as they look really beautiful first off, and secondly while I understand why some of his fans say that he uses a specific formula too much (I.e. boy and girl romance) I can understand why he does it.



Like I can recall like it was yesterday when I sat down to watch the movie Children Who Chase Lost Voices around 10 years ago, and while it was a very beautiful movie in its art, it kind of felt like it was trying too hard to go for Studio Ghibli vibes as I don’t know how to explain it, but the movie had felt like it was trying a bit too hard to be like a Hayao Miyazaki movie in some way, so my point being is while I did like how Shinkai made an attempt to break away from his typical romantic formula he had been known for doing at the time, it seems that the results didn’t go so well for some reason.",False,manga,1705775922.0,19bii9x

Waifu/Husbando Culture is Suffocating Good Character Writing.,"I think *Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury* may be one of my favorite new shows of the last couple years. This has only been more true since starting to really deep dive into the Gundam franchise over the last month or so (having previously only seen the original Tomino saga and the Origin OVA). While G-Witch isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination (it lays the trademark Gundam campiness on a little too thick in it first half or so of S1 and takes a while to find its own identity), it has a lot of fun moving the Gundam formula away from a ""war bad"" political drama into one more centered on corporate politics and has what I think to be two of the best leads in this franchise to date. Suletta and Miorine's development across the series (both in terms of their relationship and in terms of them as individuals) is honestly some of the best I've seen over these last couple years, and the ways this series isn't willing to pull any punches makes it hit so much better. The fact we were even able to get a full story within only 2 cours in the modern anime climate says enough, and I really can't recommend the series enough.

With all this being said, I have felt extremely let down by the discourse I've seen surrounding this show since 99% of it is only concerned with one thing: lesbians. Even back in Fall 2022, all I ever heard was that it was ""The Gundam show with the lesbian MCs"" and that continued into the new year with the media circus around Bandai Namco's downplaying of their relationship in press interviews. Even a lot of the more negative reviews of the show that I've seen center around it being ""clear Yuri bait"". At the CRAs (insert obligatory ""CRAs are normie trash"" comment here) G-Witch was only nominated for Best Original Anime (a category so barren that *The Marginal Service* was nominated) and the Anya Forger Award (which is barely worth a mention for reasons I don't want to get into here) and the r/anime awards were slightly better, but I still feel the fact the show never escaped the moniker of being ""The Gundam show with the lesbian MCs"" held it back from reaching a larger audience (especially considering the steep hurdle that is being a mecha show in current day). 

To boil down Suletta and Miorine to just being ""the Gundam lesbians"" and G-Witch to just being ""the Gundam show with the lesbians MCs"" just feels like a massive disservice to the show at large and especially to the two leads who felt more fleshed out than 90% of anime MCs these days. And while I've been bitching about Gundam for most of this post, I feel like it isn't an isolated issue. I'll be burned at the stake if I bring up a certain portion of the anime fandoms obsession with gay and lesbian ships whether canon or not (see JJK and the Bocchi fandom for some of the worst offenders) but even that isn't going far enough.

I feel like on a general level, our obsession with shipping and waifus/husbandos has not only kept discourse around good character writing but has started to recirculate back to the point where it has affected the quality of characters being output. Anime girls in particular feel ever more sanded down to always be marketable and safe while anime boys (if JJK is any indicator) aren't too far behind. It's no secret at this point that Gege really didn't like writing for Gojo, but when you consider just how static his archetype is can you really blame him? We have sanded anime characters down to the point where they've lost the parts of their personality that make for compelling characters and so long as we continue to sand their edges the final output will only continue to decline in quality.

I said a couple months back how the communities aversion to flawed characters is hurting this medium and I don't think that point has changed. However, diving into the discourse around G-Witch and seeing Eren yet again nominated for Best Main Character (an answer to which I've often heard as ""yeah but he's hot"") makes me think that this problem is only getting worse. I know this medium is capable of creating some really strong and dynamic characters, but we don't get there if the only names that bubble to the top do so because of who they sleep with, who we want them to sleep with, or because we want to sleep with them.

But I guess what do y'all think? How do you think the quality of character writing in anime has changed over time? Do you think our obsession with waifus and husbandos are making things better or worse? Did you watch G-Witch? Did you like G-Witch? Am I just out of touch?

Girl dumbs fatty later regrets it,"Looking for a recent anime where two boys are waiting for their friend who is fat confess to the girl he likes.

How do you feel about more anime being made to appeal to a Western audience?,"Netflix is known for this with titles like B: The Beginning, Devilman Crybaby, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, and Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. Toonami will be airing Ninja Kamui next month, which clearly has a Western audience in mind.

I find it interesting that being set in a Western country or having Western characters doesn't necessarily make an anime feel like it's made for Westerners. Anime have been set in Germany, France, England, the USA, and European-style fantasy worlds for decades— but at least to me, those older titles don't have the ""made for Westerners"" vibe I get from anime like Ninja Kamui.

Is anyone else able to feel this vibe? I can't put my finger on it, but I can sense something is different. If you are a Westerner, do you like the for-Westerners style?",False,manga,1705769188.0,19bfxfh

Paranoia Agent 20th Anniversary Rewatch two week reminder,"Hey, guys. Holofan4life here. 

I am pleased to announce that I will be hosting the 20th anniversary rewatch of Paranoia Agent

##What is Paranoia Agent about?

The infamous Shounen Bat is terrorizing the residents of Musashino City. Flying around on his rollerblades and beating people down with a golden baseball bat, the assailant seems impossible to catch—much less understand. His first victim, the well-known yet timid character designer Tsukiko Sagi, is suspected of orchestrating the attacks. Believed only by her anthropomorphic pink stuffed animal, Maromi, Tsukiko is just one of Shounen Bat's many victims.

As Shounen Bat continues his relentless assault on the town, detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa begin to investigate the identity of the attacker. However, more and more people fall victim to the notorious golden bat, and news of the assailant begins circulating around the town. Paranoia starts to set in as chilling rumors spread amongst adults and children alike.

Will the two detectives be able to unravel the truth behind Shounen Bat, or will the paranoia get to them first?

##Why should I watch Paranoia Agent?

Paranoia Agent is the brainchild of Satoshi Kon. He is the director of acclaimed films such as Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, and Tokyo Godfathers. This is his one and only TV show he was the creator and director for. I've really been getting into his work as of late, and I really want to check out the TV show he created. And what better timing given it's the 20 year anniversary than to watch it with you guys?

Urban-fantasy with lots of action,"Hey! Nowadays I’ve been more into this style of anime where it’s based on reality but with some twists of fantasy (Urban Fantasy) and especially with lots of action.

Black Lagoon (probably the most realistic)
Parasyte
Erased
Elfen Lied
Killing Bites
Inuyashiki
Death Note
Munou na Nana
My Home hero (not a lot of fantasy)
Platinum End 
Rainbow

Crunchyroll awards and their same five picks for every award.,"Does anyone else get frustrated by the fact that every year Crunchyroll has the same 7 anime for every single selection of awards for their yearly award. I get that the ones they list are the most popular of the year, but they’re not the only popular ones from the past year. It’s frustrating to me when there’s sooooo many different anime that have come out that should get a chance to be voted on, a chance to be appreciated. If you’re going to have 25 different awards then have more than the same 5/8 different anime for every one! It’s ridiculous. It makes it boring to vote and boring to hear the results. Like oh wow how fun and rewarding that jjk or aot has won five different awards. It’s not like 100+ new anime didn’t come out this past year. Each category should have different titles (with a few repeats). The fact that Best Cinematography or Best Art Direction didn’t have The Ancient Magus Bride as an option blows my mind.

So I just got done binge reading “Mythed-Up” and really enjoyed it!

I just can't find the name of this anime I watched,"I watched this anime super long ago, maybe 2-3 years ago, and I can't remember it's name. From what I remember the the protagonist was some woman and she was getting stalked by some super ugly guy. Throughout the anime he keeps getting bolder. She also has a guy friend who she has confided in about it. The rising point is when the ugly man sneaks into her room when she is not home and when she does get home and checks her cameras, she sees him crawl under her bed and never leave. He crawls out from under the bed and I think he starts chasing her. That part is kinda blank for me. I know the plot twist is that the guy friend she trusted and confided in was planning to kill her and the ugly guy was trying to warn her all along. I believe the end to the anime was her and the guy tied up or something in a shed with the guy friend. He sets the place on fire and leaves them to die but the ugly guy fights back but gets killed with an axe. I know there is also a recognizable scene where the girl receives a box of butchered human remains and when she calls the police it was actually just kimchi and she was seeing things. It gives a psychological horror feel. I just can't quite put my finger on it and it's been eating at me. Please help. No it's not Perfect Blue people have said that it isn't.

Rising of the shield hero big question (possible spoilers in answers given),Ok so I just finished season 3 of ROTSH.  Significantly better than season 2 in my opinion.  But all that aside I am seriously wondering what is going on with Alta and Aultcray.  Keep in mind I want limited info if possible.  I am usually really good about not spoiling things for myself but I hella expected this so be resolved so now I just want to know why he is constantly lurking like a predator around her.  He even asked if she had enough to eat.  The fact that aultcray is only ever watching her and only worried if she was hungry leads me to believe it has nothing to do with Alta specifically… like she is his long lost family or something.  Since Fohls is her older brother and he could t really care less I feel it might have something to do with her eyes.  Maybe it’s a certain gift someone is born with… and maybe he knew someone with it… or maybe even those eyes belong to a certain someone that I guess is continuously reborn and now it’s Alta…. I guess he could have sired her and only her and Fohls mom cheated on his dad and got pregnant.  Or maybe Fohls dad died…. I don’t know…. It’s really bugging me hard… it’s all I care about right now.  Someone that reads the manga please just tell me what the hell it is that so important about Alta to him.,False,manga,1705737544.0,19b6r4d

Just finished Kill La Kill. My thoughts.,"Spoilers below. 
.
.
.
.
.

Was recommended Kill La Kill by a friend and I just binged what was basically the entire thing. Started episode one a day and a half ago and finished the last 19 episodes all at once tonight(+ the OVA/“ending”, which I almost missed).

Yeah, I’m wiped. 

But it was still good though! My LORD the last couple of episodes had some crazy twists and turns. The biggest one (for me was) near the end when you think “damn, they killed their newborn daughter and Satuskis sister” and it’s like NAH Ryuuko is the kid. Crazy dude. That’s something I did NOT expect. Same with the Satsuki twist where she reveals her true intentions and tries to kill her mother.

My biggest praise for the show?

The villains were top tier. Satsuki and the Elite Four were great as starter “decoy” villains. Then Nui stole the show from them (quite literally). Nui was an AMAZING villain in the idea that she was basically unkillable throughout the entire show and was EXTREMELY hateable based upon how cocky she was. When she pulled out the other half of the Scissor-Blade for the first time my jaw dropped. Ragyo (the mother) wasn’t half-bad either, but I feel like they pushed more of the “she’s invincible” aspect onto her than they actually explained her backstory (or maybe they did explain her backstory? it’s been a long night).

Another good thing about the show was the musical score (no, NOT the band lady’s, though she was great in every scene she was in).  Each “theme” (the Ryuuko non-lyrical theme, the Goku uniform power-up theme, the Satuski theme, etc.) was good. As for the lyrical themes they frequently put in (the Ryuuko “don’t lose your way” (I think those were the lyrics?) theme and the Kiryuin family theme), I think they were fantastic choices. Each got the point across that they were extremely powerful beings. 

Not a lot of criticism to be had but I got WAY too much of a feeling, more than I feel they needed, they were trying to appeal to teenage Western boys.

I also felt that they could’ve gone up a notch with the Goku uniforms near the middle (4/5 Star) but chose not to. There were times I got the feeling “ok, this is it, a 4-star uniform is coming!” and it didn’t. 

Biggest questions?

Probably the biggest one I have is if Ryuuko is a confirmed lesbian (through whatever source I might’ve missed) or if it’s simply “implied” through the “re-awakened” kiss with Nui and the date with Mako. Not that it matters like crazy but I AM still curious as both those things were sudden. 

Anyway yeah, that about wraps it up. Overall rating is a solid 9/10. Good anime.

Thanks for reading! Hope you enjoyed the show as much as I did if you watched!",False,manga,1705734198.0,19b5wzg

Imagine Eva Wei being 100% Orphan,"Eva Wei still had Don Wei as her father, but the connection was shattered even before the series began. Don became a heartless man with no connection to Eva who became “Molly”. She was trying to win the “Ultimate Prize” to bring her mother Mya back and erase the pain, but there was no prize she desperately wanted, and she felt crushed. Though things work out in the end, but imagine if she completely lost her entire family Canaletto or not.

When Mya was killed in the crash, Don became a broken man and sent Eva away in a boarding school for the next 10 years. Instead of Don meeting Rick Thunderbolt to rebuild his life, Don who couldn’t go on without his wife, gets weaker and weaker after abandoning his daughter until he eventually died of grieve and broken heart. With no sign of her father’s presence anywhere, Eva grew more and more bitter to the point of only knowing pain, sadness, anger, and hatred because of the strict environment of her school and no family seeing her to seeing the dark side of the Great Race of Oban.

Eva could’ve been more like tragic characters from different shows like Scar from Fullmetal Alchemist, Shinn Asuka from Gundam SEED Destiny, and Kuvira from Avatar: The Legend of Korra. She might involve wanting to destroy everything that caused her pain or torture those to experience her pain or going to extremes to make sure she was never vulnerable even if it will cause harm to others. More likely she would be completely vulnerable to Canaletto to the point of possibly succeeding in his goals. Making her the “Ultimate Creation” of Canaletto.",False,manga,1705727256.0,19b40mx
Help identifying an anime from years ago.,"Anime identification?

I watched this anime years ago on YouTube. All I remember is:
- the main character is learning to make video games
- he (mc) lives in a house with other students
- they at one point in the season all have to move out because it's condemned?
- one guy in the house successfully makes video games
- one girl wants to be a voice actor but has been trying for three years and is on her last shot?
- they have an assembly at their school where they stage a mech video game. VA girl is the main character
- the school all has to tell their feelings to help the mech win?
- I think the guy gets the crowd to yell by confessing his feelings

I can kind of understand why Makoto Shinkai sticks to his formula due to Lost Voices,"I mean I’ve seen most of his films aside from the new one, but lately I was looking back at his movies as they look really beautiful first off, and secondly while I understand why some of his fans say that he uses a specific formula too much (I.e. boy and girl romance) I can understand why he does it.



Like I can recall like it was yesterday when I sat down to watch the movie Children Who Chase Lost Voices around 10 years ago, and while it was a very beautiful movie in its art, it kind of felt like it was trying too hard to go for Studio Ghibli vibes as I don’t know how to explain it, but the movie had felt like it was trying a bit too hard to be like a Hayao Miyazaki movie in some way, so my point being is while I did like how Shinkai made an attempt to break away from his typical romantic formula he had been known for doing at the time, it seems that the results didn’t go so well for some reason.",False,manga,1705775922.0,19bii9x

Waifu/Husbando Culture is Suffocating Good Character Writing.,"I think *Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury* may be one of my favorite new shows of the last couple years. This has only been more true since starting to really deep dive into the Gundam franchise over the last month or so (having previously only seen the original Tomino saga and the Origin OVA). While G-Witch isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination (it lays the trademark Gundam campiness on a little too thick in it first half or so of S1 and takes a while to find its own identity), it has a lot of fun moving the Gundam formula away from a ""war bad"" political drama into one more centered on corporate politics and has what I think to be two of the best leads in this franchise to date. Suletta and Miorine's development across the series (both in terms of their relationship and in terms of them as individuals) is honestly some of the best I've seen over these last couple years, and the ways this series isn't willing to pull any punches makes it hit so much better. The fact we were even able to get a full story within only 2 cours in the modern anime climate says enough, and I really can't recommend the series enough.

With all this being said, I have felt extremely let down by the discourse I've seen surrounding this show since 99% of it is only concerned with one thing: lesbians. Even back in Fall 2022, all I ever heard was that it was ""The Gundam show with the lesbian MCs"" and that continued into the new year with the media circus around Bandai Namco's downplaying of their relationship in press interviews. Even a lot of the more negative reviews of the show that I've seen center around it being ""clear Yuri bait"". At the CRAs (insert obligatory ""CRAs are normie trash"" comment here) G-Witch was only nominated for Best Original Anime (a category so barren that *The Marginal Service* was nominated) and the Anya Forger Award (which is barely worth a mention for reasons I don't want to get into here) and the r/anime awards were slightly better, but I still feel the fact the show never escaped the moniker of being ""The Gundam show with the lesbian MCs"" held it back from reaching a larger audience (especially considering the steep hurdle that is being a mecha show in current day). 

To boil down Suletta and Miorine to just being ""the Gundam lesbians"" and G-Witch to just being ""the Gundam show with the lesbians MCs"" just feels like a massive disservice to the show at large and especially to the two leads who felt more fleshed out than 90% of anime MCs these days. And while I've been bitching about Gundam for most of this post, I feel like it isn't an isolated issue. I'll be burned at the stake if I bring up a certain portion of the anime fandoms obsession with gay and lesbian ships whether canon or not (see JJK and the Bocchi fandom for some of the worst offenders) but even that isn't going far enough.

I feel like on a general level, our obsession with shipping and waifus/husbandos has not only kept discourse around good character writing but has started to recirculate back to the point where it has affected the quality of characters being output. Anime girls in particular feel ever more sanded down to always be marketable and safe while anime boys (if JJK is any indicator) aren't too far behind. It's no secret at this point that Gege really didn't like writing for Gojo, but when you consider just how static his archetype is can you really blame him? We have sanded anime characters down to the point where they've lost the parts of their personality that make for compelling characters and so long as we continue to sand their edges the final output will only continue to decline in quality.

I said a couple months back how the communities aversion to flawed characters is hurting this medium and I don't think that point has changed. However, diving into the discourse around G-Witch and seeing Eren yet again nominated for Best Main Character (an answer to which I've often heard as ""yeah but he's hot"") makes me think that this problem is only getting worse. I know this medium is capable of creating some really strong and dynamic characters, but we don't get there if the only names that bubble to the top do so because of who they sleep with, who we want them to sleep with, or because we want to sleep with them.

But I guess what do y'all think? How do you think the quality of character writing in anime has changed over time? Do you think our obsession with waifus and husbandos are making things better or worse? Did you watch G-Witch? Did you like G-Witch? Am I just out of touch?

How do you feel about more anime being made to appeal to a Western audience?,"Netflix is known for this with titles like B: The Beginning, Devilman Crybaby, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, and Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. Toonami will be airing Ninja Kamui next month, which clearly has a Western audience in mind.

I find it interesting that being set in a Western country or having Western characters doesn't necessarily make an anime feel like it's made for Westerners. Anime have been set in Germany, France, England, the USA, and European-style fantasy worlds for decades— but at least to me, those older titles don't have the ""made for Westerners"" vibe I get from anime like Ninja Kamui.

Is anyone else able to feel this vibe? I can't put my finger on it, but I can sense something is different. If you are a Westerner, do you like the for-Westerners style?",False,manga,1705769188.0,19bfxfh

Paranoia Agent 20th Anniversary Rewatch two week reminder,"Hey, guys. Holofan4life here. 

I am pleased to announce that I will be hosting the 20th anniversary rewatch of Paranoia Agent

##What is Paranoia Agent about?

The infamous Shounen Bat is terrorizing the residents of Musashino City. Flying around on his rollerblades and beating people down with a golden baseball bat, the assailant seems impossible to catch—much less understand. His first victim, the well-known yet timid character designer Tsukiko Sagi, is suspected of orchestrating the attacks. Believed only by her anthropomorphic pink stuffed animal, Maromi, Tsukiko is just one of Shounen Bat's many victims.

As Shounen Bat continues his relentless assault on the town, detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa begin to investigate the identity of the attacker. However, more and more people fall victim to the notorious golden bat, and news of the assailant begins circulating around the town. Paranoia starts to set in as chilling rumors spread amongst adults and children alike.

Will the two detectives be able to unravel the truth behind Shounen Bat, or will the paranoia get to them first?

##Why should I watch Paranoia Agent?

Paranoia Agent is the brainchild of Satoshi Kon. He is the director of acclaimed films such as Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, and Tokyo Godfathers. This is his one and only TV show he was the creator and director for. I've really been getting into his work as of late, and I really want to check out the TV show he created. And what better timing given it's the 20 year anniversary than to watch it with you guys?

Urban-fantasy with lots of action,"Hey! Nowadays I’ve been more into this style of anime where it’s based on reality but with some twists of fantasy (Urban Fantasy) and especially with lots of action.

Elfen Lied
Killing Bites
Inuyashiki
Death Note
Munou na Nana
My Home hero (not a lot of fantasy)
Platinum End

Crunchyroll awards and their same five picks for every award.,"Does anyone else get frustrated by the fact that every year Crunchyroll has the same 7 anime for every single selection of awards for their yearly award. I get that the ones they list are the most popular of the year, but they’re not the only popular ones from the past year. It’s frustrating to me when there’s sooooo many different anime that have come out that should get a chance to be voted on, a chance to be appreciated. If you’re going to have 25 different awards then have more than the same 5/8 different anime for every one! It’s ridiculous. It makes it boring to vote and boring to hear the results. Like oh wow how fun and rewarding that jjk or aot has won five different awards. It’s not like 100+ new anime didn’t come out this past year. Each category should have different titles (with a few repeats). The fact that Best Cinematography or Best Art Direction didn’t have The Ancient Magus Bride as an option blows my mind. That’s just one example of how they steal the award from an anime that might be more deserving.

I just can't find the name of this anime I watched,"I watched this anime super long ago, maybe 2-3 years ago, and I can't remember it's name. From what I remember the the protagonist was some woman and she was getting stalked by some super ugly guy. Throughout the anime he keeps getting bolder. She also has a guy friend who she has confided in about it. The rising point is when the ugly man sneaks into her room when she is not home and when she does get home and checks her cameras, she sees him crawl under her bed and never leave. He crawls out from under the bed and I think he starts chasing her. That part is kinda blank for me. I know the plot twist is that the guy friend she trusted and confided in was planning to kill her and the ugly guy was trying to warn her all along. I believe the end to the anime was her and the guy tied up or something in a shed with the guy friend. He sets the place on fire and leaves them to die but the ugly guy fights back but gets killed with an axe. I know there is also a recognizable scene where the girl receives a box of butchered human remains and when she calls the police it was actually just kimchi and she was seeing things. It gives a psychological horror feel. I just can't quite put my finger on it and it's been eating at me. Please help. No it's not Perfect Blue people have said that it isn't.

Rising of the shield hero big question (possible spoilers in answers given),Ok so I just finished season 3 of ROTSH.  Significantly better than season 2 in my opinion.  But all that aside I am seriously wondering what is going on with Alta and Aultcray.  Keep in mind I want limited info if possible.  I am usually really good about not spoiling things for myself but I hella expected this so be resolved so now I just want to know why he is constantly lurking like a predator around her.  He even asked if she had enough to eat.  The fact that aultcray is only ever watching her and only worried if she was hungry leads me to believe it has nothing to do with Alta specifically… like she is his long lost family or something.  Since Fohls is her older brother and he could t really care less I feel it might have something to do with her eyes.  Maybe it’s a certain gift someone is born with… and maybe he knew someone with it… or maybe even those eyes belong to a certain someone that I guess is continuously reborn and now it’s Alta…. I guess he could have sired her and only her and Fohls mom cheated on his dad and got pregnant.  Or maybe Fohls dad died…. I don’t know…. It’s really bugging me hard… it’s all I care about right now.  Someone that reads the manga please just tell me what the hell it is that so important about Alta to him.,False,manga,1705737544.0,19b6r4d

Just finished Kill La Kill. My thoughts.,"Spoilers below. 
.
.
.
.
.

Was recommended Kill La Kill by a friend and I just binged what was basically the entire thing. Started episode one a day and a half ago and finished the last 19 episodes all at once tonight(+ the OVA/“ending”, which I almost missed).

Yeah, I’m wiped. 

But it was still good though! My LORD the last couple of episodes had some crazy twists and turns. The biggest one (for me was) near the end when you think “damn, they killed their newborn daughter and Satuskis sister” and it’s like NAH Ryuuko is the kid. Crazy dude. That’s something I did NOT expect. Same with the Satsuki twist where she reveals her true intentions and tries to kill her mother.

My biggest praise for the show?

The villains were top tier. Satsuki and the Elite Four were great as starter “decoy” villains. Then Nui stole the show from them (quite literally). Nui was an AMAZING villain in the idea that she was basically unkillable throughout the entire show and was EXTREMELY hateable based upon how cocky she was. When she pulled out the other half of the Scissor-Blade for the first time my jaw dropped. Ragyo (the mother) wasn’t half-bad either, but I feel like they pushed more of the “she’s invincible” aspect onto her than they actually explained her backstory (or maybe they did explain her backstory? it’s been a long night).

Another good thing about the show was the musical score (no, NOT the band lady’s, though she was great in every scene she was in).  Each “theme” (the Ryuuko non-lyrical theme, the Goku uniform power-up theme, the Satuski theme, etc.) was good. As for the lyrical themes they frequently put in (the Ryuuko “don’t lose your way” (I think those were the lyrics?) theme and the Kiryuin family theme), I think they were fantastic choices. Each got the point across that they were extremely powerful beings. 

Not a lot of criticism to be had but I got WAY too much of a feeling, more than I feel they needed, they were trying to appeal to teenage Western boys.

I also felt that they could’ve gone up a notch with the Goku uniforms near the middle (4/5 Star) but chose not to. There were times I got the feeling “ok, this is it, a 4-star uniform is coming!” and it didn’t. 

Biggest questions?

Probably the biggest one I have is if Ryuuko is a confirmed lesbian (through whatever source I might’ve missed) or if it’s simply “implied” through the “re-awakened” kiss with Nui and the date with Mako. Not that it matters like crazy but I AM still curious as both those things were sudden. 

Anyway yeah, that about wraps it up. Overall rating is a solid 9/10. Good anime.

Thanks for reading! Hope you enjoyed the show as much as I did if you watched!",False,manga,1705734198.0,19b5wzg

Imagine Eva Wei being 100% Orphan,"Eva Wei still had Don Wei as her father, but the connection was shattered even before the series began.

Instead of Don meeting Rick Thunderbolt to rebuild his life, Don who couldn’t go on without his wife, gets weaker and weaker after abandoning his daughter until he eventually died of grieve and broken heart. With no sign of her father’s presence anywhere, Eva grew more and more bitter to the point of only knowing pain, sadness, anger, and hatred because of the strict environment of her school and no family seeing her to seeing the dark side of the Great Race of Oban.

Eva could’ve been more like tragic characters from different shows like Scar from Fullmetal Alchemist, Shinn Asuka from Gundam SEED Destiny, and Kuvira from Avatar: The Legend of Korra. She might involve wanting to destroy everything that caused her pain or torture those to experience her pain or going to extremes to make sure she was never vulnerable even if it will cause harm to others. More likely she would be completely vulnerable to Canaletto to the point of possibly succeeding in his goals. Making her the “Ultimate Creation” of Canaletto.",False,manga,1705727256.0,19b40mx
Help identifying an anime from years ago.,"Anime identification?

I watched this anime years ago on YouTube. All I remember is:
- the main character is learning to make video games
- he (mc) lives in a house with other students
- they at one point in the season all have to move out because it's condemned?
- one guy in the house successfully makes video games
- one girl wants to be a voice actor but has been trying for three years and is on her last shot?
- they have an assembly at their school where they stage a mech video game. VA girl is the main character
- the school all has to tell their feelings to help the mech win?
- I think the guy gets the crowd to yell by confessing his feelings


I've tried searching so hard, if anyone knows please help. Thank you so much for your time!",False,manga,1705727080.0,19b3yty

My GF hates anime,"My girlfriend/mother-of-my-child absolutely hates anime for no other reason than that she grew up thinking it's cringe. To be frank I'm pretty casual about anime myself. I like anime as an artform and I love some of the worlds and stories it provides, but there are a lot of anime I just can't get into. I grew up on Naruto and Bleach but I'm pretty sure Shonen anime isn't going to do it for her. I've tried Death Note and AoT. She was okay with DN but not AoT.

A good mecha show to get into mechas?,"I've only watched two (1.5?) mechas so far. I watched Evangelion all the way through and absolutely ADORED it! Seriously. I know this is the most 'evangelion fan ever', but I genuinely think it's a masterpiece. Very flawed, but certainly an amazing work. Honestly, I definitely enjoyed it more for it's story aspect rather than the specifically 'mecha' one.

I guess that's one qualm I have with trying to pick a new mecha. I don't care that much about giant robot fights. I think they're really cool! But I get bored of them fast. As a kid I watched the Netflix Voltron show and I think that's why I didn't really enjoy that one much. I like a show with themes of deep personal growth or politics.

What your first non anime for kids or shounen anime did you get into? And what make you get into it?,"First i must sorry for my bad english, it not my native language but i just curious about how anyone truly get into anime. 


I know when you was kid the first anime you get into will be an anime for kids like Pokemon, Digimon, Yu-Gi-Oh or shounen anime ""friendship power"" like One piece, dragonball, Bleach. And what about anime that make you think ""Oh! the anime is not a thing for kids anymore""? 


For me, when i was kid i love the animals from Pokemon and Digimon so much, so i always searching for anime with the MC is animals because i want to see him in every episode until i found a white wolf and the black hair guy picture on google i try to find some of the video about this  but my internet is very slow. Do you think i can watch the video with 2kb -3kb speed per seconds?


I waiting and waiting for long time and i finally can watch it! It is a video about fighting between black and white wolf and it have a lot of bloodshed the screen after that made me feel amazing about this anime


""Oh my god! I never thought to see something like that in the anime before!""


What i watch is a last episode of the anime name ""Wolf's rain"". When my internet speed is improved i can finally watch a whole episodes of this anime and it is a first time i watch the anime in japanese dub it feel like i hear conversation from aliens 😅. Moreover i just relize that i watched the last 4 episodes before a first episode it feel a little bit confused.


And what is your first non- anime for kids did you get into?

An anime with a lot bloodshed?, anime with a lot of complex storys? Or anime harem with a lot of fanservice?",False,manga,1705717025.0,19b0t4b

Hinamatsura was just too damn funny and had too many plot points to be left out to dry. I laugh so damn hard every rewatch.

Need help finding an anime off memory,"So off memory about a decade or so ago, when I was a kid just finding out what anime is - I stumbled upon a scene (perhaps a final ending scene?) where a group of characters, mostly male, get trapped or something, in a dark cave/room, and they couldn't breath wether from a lack of oxygen or poisonous gas (or they were just critically weak in general)  and they seem to accept their impending doom lying down next to eachother and making jokes with one and another in their last moments together.

And a character, presumably the main character dies first just as they get a sign of a rescue, without the other characters knowing he had passed already, and when they call out his name, they tragically realise they were too late, and it's nothing but silence.

This scene has stuck with me for a long time as one of the first examples of how animation can have sad and tragic endings (assuming this was the final ep of this anime considering I remember it being so), and yet I can't find it for the life of me, and I don't even know if it exist.

So if anyone knows, please help.

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
Esovan13 has my favourite reaction to our boy Tarhanlindur's great wall of spoilers~ Still consistently some of the best content I've read tho to give credit. 
>[Reading your comments](https://files.catbox.moe/a41di6.png) 


And the people hated Vaadwaur, for he spoke the truth
>Psst...[The cruel truth]>!Gamer girls are either OF traps or E-girls with an angle!<

Specs64z had some pretty awesome analysis! 

> ""Humans are all alone. They’re not connected to anyone at all."" 

> A direct contradiction to Lain’s words from Layer 02, and a really bizarre line to start off with given where the episode goes. I believe it’s Chisa’s voice? Not sure.

> Lain spends her free time these days half naked and hunched over user manuals to build a state of the art computer. Her father spies on her, seemingly aware of something we are not. This newfound hobby imbues Lain with self confidence, and she seems to be able to talk with the girls in her class more readily.

Quiddy is anti Lain of the Bear Onesie, get him!! 
> Overall the best episode yet, I feel that now that we've set the groundwork over the first few episodes things really start kicking into gear and we have a long run of really strong, albeit really bizarre episodes coming. Lain's a bit more out of her shell and assertive now (perhaps symbolized by the fact that she's left behind her iconic bear PJs) which I like to see.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!"" 

Icesmiley score a W! 
> It appears that the first man who killed himself is confusing a little girl with a monster of some sort, the Cyberia DJ is having auditory hallucinations and the man with the cat shirt is perceiving everything as it would look in a Doom/Wolfenstein first person shooter type game with the pixelated stone walls and narrow tunnels in games of that time.  We don't see anything within their world connecting to their brains; this would indicate they are living in a virtual one that can be hacked from the inside.

#[**Tomorrow's Prompt**](https://imgur.com/a/Wo825SP) You'll know it when you see it

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      

It still counts as lore if its about video games? Right, hirmuolio? 
> The game shown is commonly compared to something like Doom or Wolfestein. But I think the game visuals are most likely inspired by Daggerfall which came out two years before the anime.

> The endless labyrinthian corridors are something every Daggerfall player will learn to ~~cope~~ love. And the bit with falling down the hole is very similar to holes in Daggerfall.

"What are some anime that people may or may not know about, that were incredibly popular in your country?","This question is probably geared towards someone in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s...

I'm from S. Korea, and from my understanding,

Because Japan was economically massive in 80s (the bubble era) lots of countries could not afford to import anime that were actually popular in Japan, (or willing to invest so much in children's show) so they had to resort to cheaper/lesser known anime to import. Sometimes we got an anime that aired a decade ago.

We absolutely loved [Madou King Granzort](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2818/Madou_King_Granzort). Because [Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3837/Mashin_Eiyuuden_Wataru) was too expensive to import due to its popularity in Japan, Korean broadcasting company opted to import Granzort and air it because it was cheaper to import, since it was axed from low popularity in Japan. Later when Wataru was imported, it flunked in Korea because it was seen as Granzort clone, when in reality it was the opposite. (I'm generalizing it)

[Ai Tenshi Densetsu Wedding Peach](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1533/Ai_Tenshi_Densetsu_Wedding_Peach) was imported instead of [Sailor Moon](https://myanimelist.net/anime/530/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon), due to Sailor Moon being too expensive to import. Wedding Peach became massively popular. When Sailor Moon finally aired later, it was considered Wedding Peach clone (but yeah, eventually Sailor Moon took over).

[Captain Tsubasa](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2116/Captain_Tsubasa) was too expensive to import, so [Moero! Top Striker](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3438/Moero_Top_Striker) was aired first and became a huge hit. Captain Tsubasa aired later and was simply not as popular because kids thought it was Top Striker clone.

[Juuni Senshi Bakuretsu Eto Ranger](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2757/Juuni_Senshi_Bakuretsu_Eto_Ranger) was played in elementary schools so kids could memorize Zodiac animals 

[Full Moon wo Sagashite](https://myanimelist.net/anime/122/Full_Moon_wo_Sagashite) aired on a cable children's channel and is considered all time classic for most Koreans. Koreans get suprised when most Japanese people don't know about it.

Aaaaaaaaaaand I've heard the anime below were pretty popular in Japan, but has MASSIVE fanbase in other countries, much more so than Japan.

[Grendizer](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1985/UFO_Robo_Grendizer) was massively popular in France,

[Voltes V](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1069/Chou_Denji_Machine_Voltes_V) was a cultural phenomenon in the Philippines.

[Saint Seiya](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1254/Saint_Seiya) has a huge fanbase in Latin America.

So, What are some anime that people may or may not know about, that were incredibly popular in your country?

Just wanted to know, I like watching old stuff and discover impact it has. And I thought it would be fun to share.",False,manga,1705698716.0,19atwin

Watching Attack on Titan for the first time! Commentary and theories for Episodes 1-4,"Hello, everyone! So like the post title says, I’m watching Attack on Titan for the first time. I thought I might write down some thoughts and commentary to share with you (don’t worry, I don’t have a patreon and I’m not gonna try to get you to buy crappy merch with my name on it and I never will lol I just thought doing commentary might be a fun hobby).

This is actually my first anime, because my parents didn’t allow me to watch anime when I lived with them. But I live with my girlfriend now, so I can watch whatever I want lol this is my girlfriend’s favorite anime so I thought I’d start with it and see what the hype is about.

&#x200B;

\[Attack on Titan Ep. 1-4 Spoiler\] >!I should let you know that I do know some things about it. I know the premise, there’s people fighting giants called titans that eat people, I know the main character can turn into a titan and that he’s actually the bad guy (that’s probably why he can turn into a titan lol). I know there’s a lesbian couple that I’m apparently going to love, and a nonbinary character too. I know there’s a badass female main character, and I know this because she’s my main competition. My girlfriend just loves her lol She’s probably part of the lesbian couple. Aside from those things, I don’t think I know any other spoilers aside from maybe hearing some character’s names before, but I don’t remember any of them so it’s whatever.

I hope you enjoy my thoughts on the show, and please don’t spoil anything for me in the comments! Like, even if I ask a question or something, just don’t tell me the answer!

Episode 1

1. Wow, this animation is beautiful! And okay, we’re just jumping straight into it with the big skinless giant. Cool. Now some guys are chasing a titan in the woods on horseback and using ziplines to move around.
2. These opening credits are so cool! I like the song too, and I hope these translations are accurate. “Give us the freedom of dying starving wolves!”
3. ‘To You, in 2000 Years- The Fall of Shiganshina Part 1’ Is the episode title saying that the show takes place in the future? I saw them using cannons and swords in the opening credits so I assumed it was in the past.
4. Oh, Mikasa! I think that’s the name of the badass girl my girlfriend loves (she kinda looks a bit young for that, so I’m assuming this is a flashback. Actually it must be a flashback since I don’t think the big skinless guy has shown up yet but he’s the first thing we saw). And there’s people saying the walls are “the will of heaven manifest” so there’s religion in this show too. Somebody probably should have told my parents that, maybe they would have let me watch it lol
5. This grown ass man is offering these kids alcohol lol And he’s on guard duty too! Also, was that close up of a man decapitating a fish really necessary? Okay, that other guard just said they (I’m assuming ‘they’ are the titans) haven’t done anything but scratch at the wall for a hundred years. So are titans not intelligent? The ones we’ve seen so far in the opening did look kind of dumb and didn’t react to all those soldiers ziplining around it lol But if they were smart, couldn’t they figure out a way to climb the wall? And a few more seconds of watching answers that question lol the guard called them mindless and dead-eyed.
6. Wow, it looks like those guys in the green capes got their butts kicked. They were only fighting one titan! (unless there’s more offscreen that we didn’t see) Oh my God! They gave that lady her son’s arm! Honestly, if that was all that was left of him, I would have said to just leave the arm behind and tell her with your words. Why traumatize her any further?
7. His sacrifice meant nothing? (also, maybe just lie to the mom?) I knew this was going to be a dark show but wow!
8. Eren’s just smacking random people with sticks lol I think he has anger issues. Is he the main character who’s actually the bad guy? He’s getting a lot of screentime.
9. I like how those random bits of information just popped up in the middle of the episode lol I did read them though, that does help me picture the setting better. People live behind three giant walls then. Why three though? Wouldn’t one be enough? I imagine if the titans had a way of getting over (or under?) the wall then the other two would be kind of useless, wouldn’t they?
10. I love that Eren is brave enough to say ‘whatever’ to his parents lol I would have gotten a smack on the mouth for that. And Mikasa is a bad sister lol she threw him into a wall earlier and now she’s tattling on him. What’s their dad working on in the basement? The way the shot lingered on that key and Eren’s reaction makes it seem important. Probably something titan-related.
11. LMAO they’re not afraid of Eren at all but they are of Mikasa! Lol
12. Was that yellow lightning? And that big skinless titan just kicked through the wall! There’s already so many people dying, wtf! Why are all those other titans so short compared to the big one? And why do they have skin? I have so many questions. I need to rewatch that part cuz it’s taking me too long to type this lol
13. Oh my God, there’s bloody corpses under rocks! I hope they’re not going to get too gory. But I know the titans eat people and that could get so bad.
14. Mom’s gonna get eaten isn’t she? She’s trapped under a whole ass house! And she just said her legs are crushed and there’s one walking towards them! That drunk guard is gonna die too. No way he’s competent enough to fight a titan. Holy shit, that titan is scary. Why is it smiling? Oh, nevrmind lol he’s just bouncing. Grab the kids and go! Lol I shouldn’t laugh but that’s kind of funny. Show up and fight the titan! Nope, run away lol Also, sorry for not breaking this paragraph up. So much is happening so fast! I keep pausing and rewinding and then immediately have a new thought in the same scene!
15. Oh no, it’s not funny anymore. Oh no, they’re gonna show it, aren’t they? I don’t think I can watch this! Okay, I guess that wasn’t that bad. Not as bad as I was imagining was gonna happen.

Concluding thoughts- Well that was a great first episode! I’m sorry if my commentary has been kind of crappy. I’m sure it’ll get better once I know what’s going on more and know who everyone is and stuff.

Oh, but I do have my first theory! Okay, I’m pretty sure that blonde guy is one of the main cast. What if… he’s the main character who’s actually the bad guy? I thought it was Eren but hear me out (I know you already know so don’t tell me if I’m right or wrong!). He was talking about how humanity has to go outside the walls and how the titans could break through at anytime. What happened immediately after he said that? A giant titan shows up and breaks down the wall! And I noticed he didn’t try to help Eren and Mikasa save their mom!

My working theory is that he’s secretly the villain and somehow he’s responsible for the big skinless titan breaking the wall. Cuz if the titans could have broken it at any time, then why didn’t they? No, something made them do it, and I’m betting blonde guy’s responsible (I forget his name, sorry. I’ll try to remember it next episode).

Episode 2

1- “They first appeared over a hundred years ago, giant humanoid creatures with a taste for our blood” “We were shoved to the brink of extinction almost overnight” “the survivors erected Walls Maria, Rose, and Sina”.

Okay, I have thoughts. If the titans have only been around for a hundred years, where did they come from? And if humanity almost went extinct overnight, when did they find the time to build the walls? I have another theory (or sub-theory, anyway)! They didn’t build the walls in response to the titans killing almost everyone. The walls were already there when they used them to hide from the titans. Wasn’t that one guy saying something about how the walls are sacred? I bet they were like a giant church thing before the titans or something, Like Vatican City.

Unless I’m vastly overthinking it lol

2. Oh, the subtitles for the song are in japanese now instead of English. I kind of wanted to analyze the lyrics closer with the context of episode 1 but whatever. Oh, but I notice there’s a shot of Eren and blonde guy side by side, facing away from each other! Does that mean they’re the hero and villain of the story? I’m still suspicious of blonde guy lol Also, Eren and Mikasa are definitely older in this opening so that makes me feel better about my girlfriend being in love with Mikasa lmao I guess we’re getting a time jump at some point. Oh, they have guns too! But why use swords then?

3. Another guy preaching! I don’t recognize the Bible quote he’s saying, assuming that they use the same Bible we do. Why are the titans so weird? Some of them are small, some are huge, and that giant skinless one was enormous. I saw one with a big head and torso but tiny arms and legs! And oh my God. That titan picking that woman up by her head was somehow more distrubing to me than what happened to Eren and Mikasa’s mom. I don’t why, I think being picked up by just the head bothers me for some reason.

4. Why is Eren always hitting adults in the head? I agree with what the guard is saying here. There’s nothing they could have done. He’s not a coward, though, just smart. And oh my God, some of those titans are barely bigger than regular people! How do they eat people if they can’t even fit them in their mouth?

5. Thank you, narrator, for explaining districts lol

6. Armin! That’s his name! I’ll remember it this time. Also, why does Mikasa not seem traumatized at all by what just happened? Eren’s got a thousand-yard stare. Is it because she wasn’t watching their mother get eaten and Eren was? I hope so, cuz I don’t want to believe my girlfriend’s love interest is a bad person lol

7. They’re leaving all those people behind because the boat’s full! It’s Titanic all over again! Hah, and they’re sealing the gate too. Everyone is really effed, huh?

8. There’s another skinless one! And this one has hair and runs lol and wow, those cannons are useless. It just smashed through another wall! That’s what I was saying earlier! Why even have multiple walls? If they can break through one, they can break through all of them! Also, this second skinless titan can breath fire!

9. I’m glad they have random bits of information in the middle of this episode too. I hope they keep that up, it’s actually very helpful!

10. Oh yeah, I forgot about their dad. We didn’t find out what he’s working on in the basement. And wow, Eren has a scary face. I find it hard to believe that he’s the ‘main character who’s actually a villain’ now. That rage on his face and the way he vowed to kill the titans makes me think there’s no way he’s the one who’s actually controlling the titans. If he was, he’d never have let one eat his mom. It’s gotta be Armin! Another bit of evidence: we saw earlier that Armin was getting his butt kicked by those bullies and he called them stupid. He can’t fight (which makes us think he’s inoocent and not a threat) but he’s clearly smart. Smart enough to figure out how to control titans, maybe?

11. Ten thousand people were killed by the titans? Wow! I don’t know how many people there are in the walls total but that’s got to be a lot. And the dad is still alive! Oh shit, is dad a bad guy? What’s in that syringe? He told Eren to give him his arm and Eren called him insane. Wait, maybe he’s not a bad guy. He’s being scary but he said ‘this is the only way’ and told Eren to find the key. But why not just give him the key? Last we saw it, he had it, right? Eren just woke up, no way that was just a nightmare though. Oh wait, he already has the key lol mission accomplished, dad! Now what?

12. Another suspicious moment of Armin’s. They’re surrounded by starving refugees and Armin is getting extra food for him and his friends by having his grandpa lie to the people handing out food. They’ve got to be hinting that, at the very least, Armin’s somewhat selfish, right?

13. Eren’s picking another fight with another adult. Whoa, that guard just full on punched a kid in the face! Oh look at that, Armin’s rescuing Eren by manipulating the guard with his words. He’s a smooth talker!

14. It looks like today’s just the day for punching Eren’s face, isn’t it? Lol Maybe the reason he’s so aggressive is because of his sister. We’ve seen her beat him up twice now, and those bullies were afraid of her. Maybe Eren acts so crazy and aggressive because he’s overcompensating for her.

15. Why did she say “your mom” instead of “our mom” or just “mom”? Do they have different moms? I noticed Eren looks more like his mom than Mikasa. Maybe Mikasa takes after their dad? Also I literally lol’ed at Mikasa shoving that bread right into his mouth.

16- Oh my God. 250,000 people dead? Well, aside from the 200 who made it back. That’s insane! How many titans are there? It’s got to be a whole army of them!

17. All three of them are joining the military. I guess that makes sense, given the opening credits lol Oh, and they’re all older now! Hooray for the time jump! It’s no longer problematic for my girlfriend to have a crush on Mikasa!

18. These end credits are interesting but I can’t figure out if they mean anything. Planets and stars, Mikasa running through a field of bloody knives, one of which she’s holding? And she has short hair once she grows up! It looks good on her

Concluding thoughts: Okay, I’m starting to really get into this show now. I almost don’t want to say anything because I want to watch the next! Lol I don’t have any new theories but I do still think my “Armin is the bad guy” theory might be right. I’m gonna be keeping a very close eye on him.

Episode 3

1. The song lyrics are back to English! I can’t figure out if these lyrics mean anything yet, but they are badass nonetheless.
2. I know he’s being mean, but I love this drill sergeant. Oh wow, he just headbutted that guy with the prematurely graying hair lol Oh, they’re a monarchy, ruled by a King? File that away for later. He’s picking the bald kid up by his head, which is weirdly making me uncomfortable again. I guess I really don’t like that sort of thing. Wtf is that girl thinking? Why would you ever ever EVER eat bread at a time like this? Lmao he asks her what she thinks she’s doing and she just glances around and keeps eating! Oh wait, it’s a potato, not bread.

“It looked quite delicious and it was getting cold so I gave it shelter in my stomach, sir”. I think I’m in love. Oh, I really hope she’s one of the lesbians. OMG lmao she just broke off a tiny piece and told him to have “half”! How could you not love her?!

3. Wow, they’re all just grilling Eren on his trauma, huh? And “armored titan”? Is that the one with hair? I guess that explains why that cannon didn’t hurt him at all if he’s armored. And I guess he did seem to be covered in something but I assumed it was exposed fatty tissue.

4. Oh, prematurely graying guy is a douchebag. And apparently smitten with Eren’s sister at first sight lol

5. I don’t get what just happened. Prematurely graying guy wiped his hand on the bald kid’s back and said it was his ‘trust’. Can someone actually explain that to me please (unless the explanation contains spoilers, in which case just let me be lost)

6. Um… couple things to unpack here. One, is that Armin’s long lost twin sister or something? Two, is she not going to say anything about how Sasha (I’m pretty sure it’s Sasha. No one’s said her name in a while) just had her eyes glow red and leaped like fifteen feet to eat the bread out of her hands? Oh! The way that there seemed to be light and bubbles all around blonde girl and then a close up of Sasha’s eyes makes me think there’s attraction! Are Sasha and the blonde girl my lesbian couple?! I love them already!

7. Of course Mikasa is already the best at this zipline thing. Thank you to the mid-episode world-building lessons for explaining more about the ziplines!

8. Poor Eren! I mean, I know he’s gonna get it eventually cuz I’ve seen him ziplining around in the credits lol And another thing… when Eren is chewing Mikasa out, he says “after what happened to my mom” not “what happeend to our mom”. I really do think he and Mikasa have different mothers.

9. lmao Mikasa giving a speech to Sasha without realizing it. And then just taking the bread like that… that’s cold, man.

10. Eren and Armin are spending a lot of screen time with these two guys (I’ll learn their names soon, I swear!). They might be important side characters. I mean, we’ve met a lot of characters this episode but these two are the only one to have a big heart to heart with Eren and Armin. Okay, the blonde’s name is Reiner. Remember that!

11. Ooooh! Eren’s equipment was broken! I bet prematurely graying guy sabotaged him lol

Concluding thoughts- I love Sasha. That is all.

Okay, that’s not all. I really enjoyed that episode. It’s a nice respite after the freaking horror show that was the last two episodes. And I’m getting attached to all the new characters too! But… I know this is a dark show. How many are gonna die? :’( It better not be Sasha or that blonde girl! I still need to see them fall in love!

Episode 4

1. Oh, recap! “two terrifying new breeds of titan appeared: the Colossal and the Armored”. Okay, so are we for sure referring to the one with hair as the Armored Titan? And the other one is the Colossal Titan? I mean, it’s a fitting name lol
2. Two years after joining the cadets? And we already had a time jump too! Hold on… Remember when I said there’s no point to multiple walls if the titans can break through one? Why haven’t they broken through the other two yet if it’s been years? Clearly humans can’t stop them.
3. It’s cool of Reiner to help Armin out in boot camp. Blondes have to stick together lol
4. Thank you Drill Sergeant for reminding us slowly and clearly who everyone is and their dominant personality traits! Lol So prematurely graying guy is named Jean and he’s an insufferable smartass according to his superior. Bald guy is Connie and a “few sanwiches shy of a picnic” lol and Sasha is awesome. Pretty sure that’s what drill sergeant said: “Awesome”
5. Wait, Eren and Mikasa have different last names?
6. So Reiner’s like Eren’s mentor. And hey, are we finally going to get a scene with that blonde girl (can’t remember her name). She’s different from how she was last episode. A lot meaner based on the look she’s giving Reiner lol Oh, she’s about to kick Eren’s ass. Ooh, shin kick! Those hurt! And she wiped him out, as expected. LMAO and Reiner too! Lol
7. OH! It’s not the same blonde girl! I’m an idiot lol but her name is Annie. I like her. She’s tough, and I simp for tough women (maybe she’s one of the lesbians… why can’t they all be lesbians?) And she wrecks Eren a second time. But she’s imparting important wisdom on him. Don’t be a pawn!
8. So if I’m following this correctly, the ones who score the highest in their class go to the “interior” and don’t fight titans? And Jean wants that and that’s why he’s working so hard to be the best. So… their best soldiers never see combat? What kind of system is that? Eren’s right, it’s  messed up.
9. Reiner and Annie are giving Eren the eyes. He’s making them proud by kicking Jean’s butt. Do I sense some potential chemistry between Eren and Annie?
10. L.M.A.O! “Sasha passed some gas, Commandant.” “Why am I not surprised?” And then Mikasa force feeds Sasha some bread while Eren and Jean making violent sexual eyes at each other lol
11. Thank you for explaining the military branches! So everyone wants to be one of the unicorns, or MPs, but Eren wants to join the Scouts, who are represented by wings. And I think that drunk guard who saved Eren and Mikasa had the roses on his uniform so he must be garrison.
12. So basically, everyone who has a name made the top ten. Got it. Thank you mid-episode exposition for reminding me of their names lol
13. Annie’s giving him the side-eye again while he’s monologuing. And prematurely graying Jean is a jealous coward and I think he’s starting to realize it.
14. Wait, Captain Levi! I’ve heard that name before! And okay, drunk guards name is Hannes. Remember that! And aww I’m literally getting teary eyed. After all Eren’s raging, he forgives Hannes for not saving his mom.
15. Eren’s speech seems to have converted a few people to the Scouts. Oh my God, I love Sasha. I too shiver in pleasure at the thought of a good sandwich lol
16. It happened again! The yellow lightning and then the Colossal Titan just appeared out of nowhere! I could see behind Eren, and he did not walk up. He shot up from beneath the wall where the lightning hit! I rewound and watched it again and I caught it! He appeared out of nowhere, like he teleported! I don’t know what to do with this information yet, but I noticed it!
17. Okay, wall’s broken again. I guess the fun respite episodes are over. But look at my girl Sasha saving that falling guy!  And Eren cannot be the villain. He’s literally the only one trying to kill the Colossal Titan right now. Why would he do that if he was the one making it break the walls? Also, why is it back now? It’s been five years, right? It’s the day they graduate from the cadets. Does that timing mean anything or is it a coincidence? I also notice that Armin was nowhere in that scene when the Colossal Titan appeared. Could it be that he knowingly put himself at a safe distance? (I’m still on the ‘Armin is the villain’ train lol I know one of the main characters is and I’m pretty sure it’s him)

Concluding thoughts- I really freaking love this show. I can’t wait to watch the rest. If you enjoyed my commentary, which mostly seems to be just observation and lesbian panic, let me know! I plan to keep doing it, but even if I don’t I’m still gonna finish the show. It’s really good!<",False,manga,1705695343.0,19askda

Need help finding a gothic looking anime,"So the I saw a clip of an anime trailer/edit and I accidentally refreshed my feed. From what I saw it was set in a gothic type town and there was a group of around 4 characters who appeared to be adolescents. One was a male with an old looking pistol (similar to the style of the one from Vox Machina) and a woman by a fountain and the other two i cant remember. The theme of it seemed to be oldern Europe and the animation looked quite good. The whole thing was set at night and there were lots of crows. Pls I know it's very vague but it looked so good and I've been looking for it for so long.

Delicious in Dungeon was a terrible name until it JUST clicked for me...now it is the best,"I always like to see how show titles and even dialogue within will be localized. Many shows do a great job, but I thought Delicious in Dungeon really blew it. It just was so bad for me. It literally meant nothing, and didn't indicate what the show would be about...less than Dungeon Meshi anyway.

So I was talking to a friend and I abbreviated Dungeon Meshi to DM. I thought to myself quickly how clever the Japanese title is compared to English that even the abbreviation references the source...then it clicked what the localized title was doing!

Should I continue watching Attack on Titan?,"This is truly just an honest question. I don't mean to offend any fans. We can have differing tastes and opinions on things, and that's fine, I'm asking on behalf of mine.

I absolutely loved season 1. I finally had the urge to rewatch it again after years so I can finally finish the show. Now coming up on season 2, I'm remembering why I dropped the show.

After s1, I followed the manga for a long time, and remember being bored and disappointed in the quality of the art (being spoiled by Berserk and all). I'm remembering why I dropped the show, was because of how irritating and boring I found Historia as a character and how she was suddenly shoehorned in as vital to the story. I get that she develops as a character or whatever, but I don't really care if she stops being a coward, I just find her painfully boring as a trope entirely. Reading up on a spoiler that her titan form so happens to have angel wings just has me rolling my eyes.

S1 was just so good to me in how the story kept moving along, and the soundtrack was top notch. I'm trying to watch season 2 again and find myself playing it at a faster speed just to get through it to see if S3 is any better. Having seen more of the manga than S2, I know that it still doesn't really pick up after a while. I just don't care about Historia as a character let alone her backstory or how her arc ends. I also found the dialogue/writing in general not very interesting.

However, I do like other characters such as Annie, Hange, Sasha, Erwin, and Levi. I want to see how their characters end up, but I'm just finding it hard to get through S2.Anyways, should I continue and give it a chance? Thanks.",False,manga,1705691439.0,19aqzj9

Getting Back Into Mecha,"I'm in my late 50s and I remember fondly watching Starblazers and Robotech in the '70s and '80s in the USA. There may have been others, but none of them were combination robots (like lions that combine into an even bigger robot).

I'd like to watch them (and more like them) again, but I do want to respect my nostalgia. I know what we got in the US in the '70s and '80s was heavily modified, but I want to try to build on what I remember (or think I remember) rather than ignore it.

Is there a way to do that? I do have access to some stuff through my local library. Is anything streaming?

Is there anything else like this you would recommend? If I hadn't seen it before I don't have to honor any nostalgia and I would be open to more stuff.

Thanks!

EDIT: I should mention that I know Starblazers was originally Space Battleship Yamato, and that what I saw as Robotech was a combination of things including Macross (though I would have only seen the first season so that is probably Super Dimension Fortress Macross).",False,manga,1705688029.0,19apm7j

Horror/Thriller/Mystery... or just Any Recommendations?,"Hi y'all! I was a big anime watcher as a kid/teen, like obsessive almost haha. But stopped and haven't watched anything since 2015/2016. 
I think the last animes I watched and (still) loved were Erased and Death Parade

I love horror/psychological or really anything that gets you into a gritty or dramatic story. Mystery is also fun to me, stuff where you follow along as things are solved or unraveled.
Although I do also like mundane slice of life, light hearted stuff as well to keep moods up. 

Anyone got any recs?
Again I haven't watched anything since 2016, so even recs from 2018 animes are good!

 I'll list animes (of no specific genres) that I like to maybe help give an idea (please don't cringe at some of these haha):

• Gangsta, Angel Beats, Death Parade, Erased, Corpse Party, School-Live!, Black Butler, OHSHC (lol), Death Note, Kiznaiver, Soul Eater, The Apothecary Diaries

(Note: I just started The Apothecary Diaries and love it for some reason?? The sherlock-solving aspect is fun and I love the mc. Any recs for smthn like this is also appreciated!)

Flavors of Code Geass characters,"*This post contains Code Geass Season 2 spoilers.*

We are used to thinking about character traits as something universal. For example, anyone can be ""cold"". ""Coldness"" is the same in everyone. That's the usual paradigm.

But we can change that paradigm. We can split any trait into a colorful spectrum. We can have 7 flavors of coldness. 7 flavors of kindness. 7 flavors of vulnerability. You name it. And we can have much more than 7, of course.

Splitting traits into multiple versions — and realizing the meaning of each version — would allow us to find connections between characters we wouldn't ever be able to figure out otherwise.

Do you care about Code Geass characters enough to investigate how they connect to characters in other stories? Even if it's gonna be a bit challenging?

## Trait flavors

Let's give some examples of trait flavors.

Lelouch's coldness signals his separation from specific people, his specific tragedies. CC's coldness signals her separation from the whole society or the whole world, as if she's an alien. Lelouch still cares about and engages with society a lot — CC doesn't give a shit. Lelouch's coldness is more palpable and angsty, while CC's coldness is more otherworldly and serene. He's a growling cold geyser, she's the surface of a frozen lake. Both characters can be cold, but their coldness has different flavors / vibes / meanings.

Suzaku's coldness isn't even ""cold"", it's barely able to hide his pent-up rage and saltiness. Nunnally's coldness is her defense against the world and her brutal determination to reach truth & justice — even if *reaching truth & justice* requires firing a couple of nukes on innocent civilians. Nunnally knows that being good isn't always easy. Her and Suzaku's kindness flavors appear deceptively innocent.

## What is the general method of splitting traits into flavors?

It requires analyzing each character on **three** levels:

1. ""Unique attributes"". They describe what makes a character stand out compared to other characters in the story.
2. ""Abstract contradiction"". It describes an abstract conflict at the core of the character.
3. ""Trait flavors"". They describe the special meaning behind generic traits of the character.

Attributes are like puzzle pieces, we need them to build a contradiction. Then we can use the contradiction to split traits into flavors. Attributes —> Contradiction —> Flavors. You'll see how it works with examples.

## ... ... ...

## Lelouch's unique attributes

What's unique about Lelouch Lamperouge, compared to other important CodeGeass characters?

* He's the loneliest character, yet the most social.
* He's one of the most affected by relationship grief/distress. Along with Suzaku.
* He has the most hidden tragedies.

## Lelouch's abstract contradiction

What's Lelouch's abstract contradiction? He has ***""the most contradictory connection to people"".*** On one level he's a social dude, on a deeper level he's a lonely manipulator, on a yet deeper level he's a social dude again.

## Similar characters

I think those characters share Lelouch's contradiction: (*""having the most contradictory connection to someone""*)

***Snape*** *from Harry Potter,* [*Elsa*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLzfXQSPBOg) *from Frozen,* ***Kakashi*** *from Naruto,* [*Scrooge McDuck*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMB3aYY5vOs) *from DuckTales 2017,* ***Darth Vader*** *from Star Wars,* ***Gandalf*** *from LOTR,* ***Amon*** *from Korra,* ***Patroclus*** *from Hades videogame 2020,* [*Carl Fredricksen*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWEW_qTLSEE) *from Up 2009,* ***Jeong Jeong*** *from ATLA.*

Some of them also share those unique attributes:

* They have a *mental relationship* with a person which is stronger than their *real relationship* with said person. Their life is completely reshaped by grief/distress from a past relationship.
* They put up a half-true facade of a withdrawn person. They may look like they are naturally withdrawn, but their withdrawnness usually hides a sad backstory. They have the most hidden tragedies.
* Gandalf is special. He's simultaneously a loner and the center of all communication/planning. So he, too, has ***the most contradictory connection to people.***

(Reminder. *Unique attributes* are like puzzle pieces from which we can build *abstract contradictions*. The same contradiction can be built from very different puzzle pieces. That's why seemingly unrelated characters — like Lelouch and Snape and Gandalf — may end up being connected. Unique attributes are the necessary ""evidence"" to back up the connections, without them the analysis falls apart. If you forget that, this post will seem like nothing more than a bunch of weak, vague analogies.)

## Lelouch trait flavors

Knowing Lelouch's abstract contradiction, we can figure out the meanings/flavors of his traits:

* Lelouch's coldness signals his separation from specific people, his specific tragedies. Similar to Scrooge McDuck and Esla and Carl Fredricksen.
* Lelouch's ""softie"" traits make his isolation from people contradictory. Similar to Scrooge McDuck and Elsa and Gandalf.

Some **iLiKETRAiNS** songs would fit Lelouch and similar characters (e.g. [A rook house for Bobby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjXKR6xVzAI), [Terra Nova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoHloQFJNvs), [Death of an Idealist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyuT5rZVe10), Stainless Steel, The Accident). They focus on irreversible consequences and tipping points of breakdowns. Those songs have ""Lelouch's voice"".

## ... ... ...

## CC's unique attributes

What's unique about CC, compared to other important CodeGeass characters?

* She is the loneliest character.
* She has the most unusual background and motivation.
* She's the most physically abused and mentally resigned.

## CC's abstract contradiction

What's CC's abstract contradiction? ***Her identity is undermined from the outside and from the inside.*** She has no societal status and she has a deathwish. Alternatively, ***she's just externally and internally weird***. (""Weird"" compared to other CodeGeass characters.)

## Similar characters

I think those characters share CC's abstract contradiction:

[*Sheldon Cooper*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VQu0SxdzI) *from Bing Bang Theory,* ***Draco*** *from Harry Potter,* [*Zuko*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLpfsSLRAA8) *from ATLA,* ***Gaara*** *from Naruto,* ***Kurisu Makise*** *from Steins;Gate,* ***lord Beckett*** *from Pirates,* ***Lapis Lazuli*** *from Steven Universe,* [*Sailor Mars*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor_Mars) *from Sailor Moon,* [*Kiki*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0D4hdRELJ8) *from Delivery Service,* ***Luka*** *from Miraclous,* ***Randall*** *from Monsters Inc.*

* Take Zuko. His identity is externally undermined (he's a noble who was banished) and internally undermined (his feelings are confused and messed up). He's the most externally and internally weird character of his story — he has the weirdest circumstances and the weirdest mindset.
* Take Sheldon Cooper. He's a genius, but he's placed in circumstances where his genius doesn't matter (his identity is externally undermined) and Sheldon is deeply confused by it (his identity is internally undermined). He's the most externally and internally weird character of his story.

(Reminder. *Unique attributes* are the bones. *Abstract contradiction* is the shape of the skeleton. *Trait flavors* is the shape of the meat on the skeleton. All those components should work together in order to make sense.)

https://preview.redd.it/q60wlhzaoedc1.jpg?width=1990&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6dac44a685c689b85fc917e3fb0f37b9ff6798a

https://preview.redd.it/a6yvrnzaoedc1.jpg?width=1727&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b187a3eda5f40765ba8a8b053788c99996ef77f

## CC trait flavors

Knowing CC's abstract contradiction, we can figure out the meanings/flavors of her traits:

* CC's coldness and calmness signal her separation from the whole society or the whole world, as if she's an alien. Similar to Sheldon Cooper and Gaara. Also Draco (he's separated from  the layer of society the story is focused on) and lord Beckett.
* Her vulnerability highlights her fundamental mental confusion and distress. Similar to Draco, Zuko, Gaara, Lapis, Sheldon and Kiki.

Everyone is vulnerable when they're confused and distressed, but CC's vulnerability is about the deepest confusions and distresses.

CC is a ""liminal being"", with no external status and unstable internal identity. Songs about characters in [liminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality) situations with liminal states of mind would fit her. Some songs of **The Cure** and **Ashbury Heights** are right for the job. E.g. [SmAlLeR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsPSmZ6lVSk) (a strangely dispassionate character in a world-shaking situation), [Derrick is a Strange Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3gDIsN5Lh4) (a strangely calm person intruding in a relationship); [Lullaby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijxk-fgcg7c) (a strangely calm character in a life-and-death situation), [The Same Deep Water As You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbAKp4HA7co) (strange situation, strange calmness). Those songs have ""CC's voice"", CC's calmness.

## ... ... ...

## Suzaku's unique attributes

What's unique about Suzaku Kururugi, compared to other important CodeGeass characters?

* He's the most ""unlucky"" character. The crap he's getting doesn't logically follow from his own story.
* He's a character who suffers the most / gets broken the most because of his connection to the main character.
* His ideals and goals get stretched and subverted the most.

>*""Your fucking moral compass is a Roulette Wheel!"" (c.) Lelouch about Suzaku's stretching ideals*  
>  
>*""I'll stop this violence the only way I know how: with more violence."" (c.) Suzaku*

## Suzaku's abstract contradiction

What's Suzaku's abstract contradiction? ***He gets the biggest amount of unintended shit.*** His girlfriend is accidentally killed by his friend; his friend turns out to be a war criminal; he is forced to fire a nuke against his will.

## Similar characters

I think those characters share Suzaku's abstract contradiction:

[*Sam*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samwise_Gamgee) *from LOTR,* ***Will Turner*** *from PotC,* ***Morty*** *from Rick and Morty,* ***Steven Universe****,* [*John Watson*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaT7IYQgyqo) *from Sherlock BBC,* ***Darwin*** *from The Amazing World of Gumball,* ***Gon Freecss*** *from Hunter × Hunter,* ***Madoka Kaname*** *from Puella Magi,* ***Jordan C. Wilde*** *from Oban Star-Racers,* ***Bolin*** *from Korra.*

Some of them also share those unique attributes:

* They are forced to become Gods.
* They are dragged into adventures and intrigues.
* They have to deal with an unintended amount of other people's crap. Get caught in a crossfire a lot. Get an extra amount of abuse. Have a """"friend"""" who brings them trouble.
* They are forced to behave out of character. [Develop their darker side.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9BuVyDTxo)

## Suzaku trait flavors

Knowing Suzaku's abstract contradiction, we can figure out the meanings/flavors of his traits:

* His coldness hides pent-up rage and saltiness. Similar to John and Gon and Will and Steven.
* His kindness appears deceptively innocent. Similar to John and Gon and Will and Steven.

>*""Nothing that happens now is any of your concern! Your very existence is a mistake! You need to be erased from the face of the Earth!"" (c.) Suzaku's pent-up rage is coming through*  
>  
>*""Eat shit and die."" (c.) Suzaku's pent-up rage is coming through again*

## ... ... ...

## Kallen's unique attributes

What's unique about Kallen, compared to other important CodeGeass characters?

* She and Suzaku are the most confused and irritated characters. However, her confusion and irritation come from internal doubts.

## Kallen's abstract contradiction

What's Kallen's abstract contradiction? ***Her awareness/self-awareness makes it harder for her to fulfill her role.*** She's a powerful warrior, but people get into her head. She thinks too much!

## Similar characters

I think those characters share Kallen's abstract contradiction: *(""extra awareness makes the character worse or better at fulfilling their role"")*

***Ron*** *from Harry Potter,* ***Chel*** *from* [*The Road to El Dorado*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_to_El_Dorado)*,* ***Konata*** *from Lucky Star,* [*Garfield*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield_(character))*,* ***Flame Princess*** *from Adventure Time,* [*Ahsoka Tano*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano) *from Star Wars.*

* Take Konata and Garfield. Their extra awareness allows them to become ultimate trolls.
* Take the Flame Princess. \[Adventure Time spoilers\] >!Her dad brainwashed her into believing she's evil. Her friend betrayed her. She reflects on having emotions.!<
* Take Ron. \[Harry Potter spoilers\] >!His extra awareness almost leads him to betraying his friends (he feels overshadowed by Harry)!<.

## Kallen trait flavors

Knowing Kallen's abstract contradiction, we can figure out the meanings/flavors of her traits:

* Kallen's anger means her desire for true personal connection, without secrets and lies (e.g. when she points the gun at Lelouch to learn if she's geassed). Or her desire to defend something personal (e.g. when she slaps Lelouch on the bench).

Kallen can show the most non-toxic anger. The fire which hurts, but doesn't leave a poisonous burn.

## Mao's unique attributes

What's unique about Mao, compared to other important CodeGeass characters?

* His full story is the most ""hidden""; his full story is the most inconsequential for his current story. In the current story, Mao is just a crazy villain who can only be killed — his actual story is much deeper, but that doesn't matter anymore for his own fate.

## Mao's abstract contradiction

What's Mao's abstract contradiction? ***His motivation is more complicated than his role in the story / his motivation is different from his role in the story.***

## Similar characters

I think those characters share Mao's abstract contradiction:

Wolfwood*** *from Trigun, maybe* ***Legion*** *from Mass Effect.*

* Take Edward Elric. His own motivation is to fix his and his brother's bodies, yet his role in the story is to just be a good guy. \[Fullmetal Alchemist spoilers\] >!And his original motivation doesn't matter much for the main plot.!<
* Take Knuckles. He's the defender of the Master Emerald and the last of his tribe and la-la-la but his role in the story is just to be a bad guy or a good guy. We can forget the backstory. We can ignore the specifics of his thoughts.

# Wrapping up

Thank you for reading this post. Feedback is welcome.

* Did the analysis change your perception of the characters in any way?
* What points were the hardest to understand/accept?
* Can you feel the ""trait flavors"" at least a little bit?

I know, my analysis deconstructs characters quite radically. But we could view it as a good thing and try discussing it.",False,manga,1705674099.0,19ak6vp
Looking for an anime from the 2010s,"I need some help figuring out an anime which I only partially watched at a friend's house (who of course can't remember watching a show like that ever). It should be at least three years old, but didn't look to ancient, so I'd place it in the 2010.

The genre should be something like horror, mystery or adjacent.

It's in a modern day urban setting, looking rather serious and realistic.

It's winter and snowing and we're following a boy of school age (middle or high schooler) through town with his umbrella against the snow. At the roadside he sees a girl of his age standing there, looking absent-minded.

There are some news about deaths occuring in town from a wild animal or implied werewolf and there seems to be a connection to that girl.

That's it. I don't remember watching more than that.",False,manga,1705673143.0,19ajv09
Anime that you can play to high school students,"I remember when I was in high school, my teacher would play Dead Poets Society and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest when the exam season’s over and there was nothing left for her to teach in the semester. What anime can have the same effect?",False,manga,1705672783.0,19ajq2h
Gushing over Magical Girls gained big popularity in Japan,"This anime is a massive hit in Japan.

Currently, all three Blu-ray editions are in the top 20 sales on Amazon (while other anime of the season are much lower), and this is just for pre-orders. When the Blu-rays are released, they might climb even higher. EDIT: I just checked yesterday the blu ray was top 20, but today they are Top5 to 3

On the Niconico ranking, Episode 1 was ranked top1, and Episode 2 got the top2, with just a 0.3% difference from the first (Dungeon Meshi).

Apparently, the manga also got a significant boost in sales. EDIT: Top manga Amazon JP

Previews for the upcoming episodes are reaching 200kviews on YouTube for each episode, whereas the second-highest preview views (Dungeon Meshi) are around 100k. The opening is soon to reach 1 million views on YouTube.

This marks the seiyuu's (Fuuka Izumi) first lead role as a real character (her other roles were just background characters). Her performance is exceptionally well-received by the Japanese audience and has been praised by her more experienced seiyuu colleagues, so her career is off to a great start.

Another factor that contributed to its popularity, I believe, is that the Japanese had high expectations for the ""Mato Seihei no Slave"" anime but were somewhat disappointed with its quality. In contrast, for ""Gushing over Magical Girls,"" the Japanese had low expectations due to the studio ""Asahi Production,"" but in the end, they were pleasantly surprised to see it push the ecchi elements even further than the manga.

In summary, if it continues like this, the anime has the potential to be the number one hit of the Winter 2024 season in Japan!

A very good start to the year for Yuri

Today I learned that the Pokémon brand is worth far more than Yu-Gi-Oh!,"This wasn’t a topic I thought too deeply about in the past, if at all, but today I was watching some Yu-Gi-Oh and then I was thinking Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokémon are what got me and millions of other kids my age into anime, so they’re sort of like rivals. So, then I wondered what each of of their brands are worth. My simple brain was pretty surprised to learn that Pokémon was worth around a hundred billion while Yu-Gi-Oh is worth around 20 billion. I had always considered these two brands to be equal in impact, but when I thought about it this makes sense. As far I know, Yugioh is mostly only the card game and the anime. It hasn’t released any new video games other than Master Duel, which is free to play, in the past few years. Meanwhile, Pokémon is the video games, anime, trading card game, manga, toys, and whatever else it has in its ever expanding empire. Pokémon is simply a bigger media brand.

 Still, I don’t think I’m wrong in thinking that they’re equal in their cultural impact. I mean, for a lot of kids my age, Pokémon and Yugioh was the gateway into Japanese anime and entertainment. They introduced us to a whole new world. Even if Pokémon is the bigger and more valued franchise, I personally feel that they are equal in the effect they had on our lives and the things we like.

Also, as a side note, can we talk about how fricking crazy it is that Yu-Gi-Oh is worth billions now? For those who don’t know, Yugioh first started off as a manga about games rather than just the card game it inspired. It was created by Kazuki Takahasi. I heard it was in danger of being axed, but fans were interested in the card game he designed for one of the chapters and that led him to make it more important and eventually make the card game the main focus entirely. This led to its continued popularity and the rise of the trading card game we all know and love.

Seriously, do you all understand how insane it is that a manga that was in danger of being axed turned itself around and led to the creation of one of the world’s most popular TCGs that has world championships and is played by people all across the world, and is now a brand worth around 20 billion?! The manga was published in 1996 (the first Pokémon games were also released that year). So, in just 20 plus years, it became a franchise worth nearly 20 billion. Pokémon may have been destined for success from its first release, but who could have predicted Yugioh would become what it became at the beginning? Plenty of successful brands have rather humble origins, but this just stands out. Kazuki Takahashi left us too soon, but he left behind one hell of a legacy.",False,manga,1705669840.0,19aiqrt

Any anime similar to Dungeon Meshi ( Delicious in Dungeon)?,"Just started this on Netflix and although there’s only 3 episodes it has my heart.

  I would prefer non-isekai but I’m not totally against it. (I’ve seen Overlord, Mushoku Tensei, Arifureta, HTSADL, TenSura).

So I watched Gurren Lagann in 2024,"I’m shocked I held off on this one for so long, because it was AWESOME! 

I’ll try to gather my thoughts because there is so much I enjoyed about this one. 

You are able to just embrace some of the more absurd moments purely because the anime is so earnest. I can appreciate something that knows what its identity is, and isn’t ashamed to  be itself. Encouraging, empowering, hopeful, and positive. Gurren Lagann is basically the anti- Evangelion, and far better IMO. If this had been my first anime, I could see myself giving it a 10/10, though I hold a few others even higher. 

The characters were enjoyable and believable even in the most crazy situations. And the time skip especially endears you to them. Yoko being my favorite unsurprisingly. And when certain anime today unceremoniously kill off characters without any real change to the story, Kamina’s death was extremely refreshing to see. Sad of course, but he isn’t forgotten either, he makes his mark on the story all the same. I felt in that episode, even though i saw the flags all around him. 

Animation holds up, I’m impressed just how Gainax did it, even with 2010s and 2020s anime increasing the bar constantly. 

If there’s one thing that astounded me the most, it would be the scale. From underground, to surface, to proper civilization, to interstellar space. The world building is grandiose, and I appreciate it.  Not to mention spanning over 7 years with all the established characters in new places and occupations.  

It is a love letter to the indomitable human spirit and as cheesy as it sounds on paper, it works here just great.

I was asking a friend about it and they sead that this may be a good place to ask or at least be re detracted to the proper place to ask the general plot is that it is about a high school girl who is approached by a group of people and told that she is one of the select few chosen. They go to a town in a dome in the sky where she discovers that each of them has unique abilities. It is then found out that every few years they are replaced, having their memories wiped and then reintegrated into normal life. The main character doesn’t want to do that and breaks the cycle, encouraging the others to do the same.  I Rember it was a 12-to-13-episode anime or close to that.

"Need Anime Recommendations. I enjoy mature themes, more below.","I have 3 different main categories I enjoy. Dark Tragedies, Mature and Relatable and Beautiful romance.

Some of my current favourites that relate to the Dark Tragedy element is Attack on Titan, Steins;Gate, Berserk, One Piece, Hunter x Hunter (in a way).

Some of my current favourites that relate to Mature and Relatable are Chainsaw Man, Vinland Saga, Goblin Slayer, Another, Parasyte.

Some of my current Beautiful romance favourites are Violet Evergarden, Your Name, Howl's, Parasyte.

I like to feel emotions, anime is an outlet for it. One Piece checks off ALL the boxes. You fall in love with all the characters and care about them. You cry for a FUCKING BOAT. You get mad at the evil shit the World Government is doing. You get disgusted at shit Stain Charlos does. You're amazed at WHITEBEARDS POWER as well as other crazy cool strong characters. I don't think I've experienced fear in one piece yet, I have not experienced fear as much as when Goku Black arc was playing.

Other honourable mentions: Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, My Hero Academia (notably season 6), Naruto (notably non-shippuden), As cringe as it even is, I enjoyed the story in Darling in the Franx. The Promised Neverland.

I'm a sucker for a GOOD story with GOOD characters and not OVER THE TOP powers (if powers exist).

What’s an anime that unexpectedly became a miss?,"Not all anime lived to their popularity as the time they got previewed, some ended up becoming irrelevant as soon as the first month of airing for one reason or another.

One good example would be Detective is Already Dead. The first episode was alright despite the unclear direction, but the second episode gave a big dent on the series' reception, also doesn't help that the show ended up going all over the place trying to appease every niche but failed to catch one.

On a similar note, Re:Creators. Reverse Isekai is pretty uncommon at the time, so the trailer full of attractive character design and action gave people wrong expectations to become the ""Next Fate:Stay Night"". The exposition in the first few episodes broke the pacing.

One other case was Azur Lane. The game was already big internationally so it's not a surprise that the first anime was hyped, and the first episode surely delivered with more questions than answers, and people were quick to compare it to Kantai Collection. Unfortunately, the fanservice episodes every other week broke the pacing, and the ones that actually move the progress forward was bugged with mediocre animation that gave the impression as if the entire budget was wasted on the first epiosde. Ultimately, the anime had a lackluster storyline that fails to expand the game's lore (at least at the time). Doesn't help that the last two episodes were aired much later due to production issues. I guess that's the consequence for pushing the pilot episode to be aired during [the main character's IRL launch date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(CV-6)).",False,manga,1705636185.0,19a9sqw

Wow. It's…been a **long** ride. One full of **excitement**, fear, strength and **tears**. I don't think any anime, or piece of media, has tugged on my heartstrings and left me in shambles quite like AoT. Countless components made AoT the unforgettable and impactful anime it was. But what shocked me most of all was how well the anime transitioned into new phases and how it managed to demonstrate change through the **soundtrack**, **unforgettable characters**, and **plot twists**. Each of these crafted an amazing experience.

Please be aware; there are **major** spoilers up ahead.

https://preview.redd.it/4fv0dncesadc1.png?width=196&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6d883c5a67c99e61379e37ae6a96d20ca298e6c

Moving on, the soundtrack is, least to say, beautiful. It transforms slowly throughout the anime, showing the change of genre and how greatly music can demonstrate the transformation of an anime.

Each opening captures the essence of the corresponding season. Shingeki No Kyojin, Opening 1, captures the determination and strength the 104th recruits possess to bring peace to their homeland. This specific line, ‘They’re the prey, and we’re the hunters’, demonstrates their confidence and hope in defeating Titans.

Harmony is used in the background to show how all scouts are fighting for the same thing. Electric guitars, as well as the upbeat tone, symbolise the fast paced nature of the show, and the sad yet inspirational lyrics symbolise the dark themes of the show.

One specific lyric ‘Even if you pray, nothing will be changed. But that which can alter the present is the resolution to fight’ aids the message of taking action, and, as Armin Arlert said,

*""A Person Who Cannot Sacrifice Everything, Cannot Change Anything.”*

Season 2’s opening is my favourite. It demonstrates the sacrifices scouts have to make in order to achieve a brighter future. ‘Dedicate! Dedicate! Dedicate your hearts!’ hammers in this message, as well as ‘I wonder what expression our faces had, what our eyes conveyed. As we focused on our goal’. This specifically talks about persistence and continually moving on. As in the previous opening, an upbeat and fast paced beat is used to demonstrate the pace and hope of the show

Finally, season 4 has two openings; ‘My War’, and ‘Rumbling’. I found My War to perfectly portray the themes present in season 4; brutality and war. ‘Angels playing disguised..in devil’s faces’ talks about how the world views those on Paradis Island as devils - although they are actually innocent. Children in the harmony and this line, ‘Children cling to their last coin’ comments on the brutality of war and how many innocent children are affected, or die, due to the tragic situation.

The song has a militarial feel with the constant repeated lyrics and messages of ‘winning the war’ (’This is my last war’).

Additionally, ‘You are the real enemy..’ describes the complexity of Attack On Titan; it is unclear who is in the right or the wrong, yet both sides have their reasons to fight each other, so view each other as the enemy, which prolongs conflict. It demonstrates how both sides have their own humanity and struggles, yet fail to see the other side having the same.

Something else that makes AoT the masterpiece that it is the characters and character development. Each character develops in a new way, and there are no shallow characters. This creates an emotional and impactful experience. I’ll be referencing a few characters in extensive detail this section, so buckle up!

https://preview.redd.it/ivu6rqiduadc1.png?width=188&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb0b8aec5dfe2fcd5f834869f70991fad45917bc

To begin with is Eren Yeager. In the beginning, Eren is a determined and outgoing boy, whose goal is to ‘kill all the titans’ and reach freedom. He reaches this point when Armin teaches him about the possible outside globe - he realises his lack of freedom, and the distant, beautiful world that had been taken from him. This drive helps him move forward in his goals.

&#x200B;

[S1 - S3 Eren](https://preview.redd.it/aursv3q92bdc1.png?width=1073&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5f0f29b132e105c67a0d607c2d0ae44a0f0b5af)

However, as we progress through the book, **his perspective is really opened**. It seems as if his character greatly develops, however, it is clear that he had been like this from the start, and our perception of him had simply changed. Transformation is seemingly obvious, yet it's much more deeper than that.

This is because in the beginning, Eren constantly stated how ‘he was born into this world’ as a justification for the things he did. This implies his true nature was to obtain freedom from the day he was born. This is backed up by Mikasa,

*""Everyone says Eren has changed. Even I believed it. But maybe that's wrong. If that’s who Eren truly was all along.. Eren hasn’t changed one bit from the start.*”

This is not to say that Eren’s actions were excusable, rather, they were a cause of his nature.

1. We slowly see Eren reveal himself to be an ‘antagonist’. One who seemingly values the lives of a few over millions. It is understandable that he would want to protect his friends and fight for freedom, however, taking the Rumbling as an approach was, least to say, extreme. It is important, however, to consider that the world demonised and planned to exterminate those on Paradis Island from the beginning; including Eren and his beloved friends. This is a significant reason why the Rumbling occurs, and this is identified by a Marleyan commander in the last episode of the anime:

*“All the problems arising from our faults we dumped onto the “island of devils.” As a result, that monster was born and now it’s marching our hatred right back toward us.”*

This may seem to contradict the statement that Eren’s nature is to obtain freedom. I personally believe that Eren’s actions were a cause of nature and nurture. The environment he grew up in, and the person he was born as.

1. Eren’s character contains many flaws and contradictions, such as his ongoing desire for ‘freedom’ despite being a slave to the powers he possesses. How, exactly, is he a slave in this regard? Well, Eren has no freedom in his actions, as he knows that any decisions he makes are not mainly of his own accord, rather, what follows the timeline he foresees using the Attack Titan’s powers, and has no choice to follow. This makes him unfree in his choices, and therefore his life.  

2. One of the reasons Eren is so well written is the fact that his motivations are clear to identify. Numerous tragic things had occurred to lead him to his position of ‘the villain’. These things make his character tragic and easy to empathise with. This includes:  


* The Nature which he had been born with
* A life stuck inside closed walls
* Watching his mom being eaten alive.
* Realisation of Life outside the walls; shattered dreams
* Racism towards his island
* Realising his father was an ‘evil’ man
* Having the world demonise him
* Many of his comrades dying.

This does not excuse the actions that he took. **Genocide is never ‘okay’**. However, it was clear that the situation was desperate, and he believed this was the only feasible option to reach the outcomes he desired. There may have been many options other than the rumbling, but they came with the high likelihood the Paradis would be destroyed in the near future. Therefore, Eren’s actions fit with his motivations and backstory.

Overall, AoT creates a compelling and tragic main character. His motivations to reach his goal are clear and provide reason for his actions. Eren Yeager differs from the MC of most animes, as his role changes drastically through the anime (Protagonist/Antagonist).

Moving on, another well crafted character is Levi Ackerman. Personally, Levi is my favourite character; both personality and appearance wise. He is also one of the charecters which, I would argue, underwent the most trauma, yet went through the least transformation. The creators intentionally made it this way; this is why he is such a popular and well written character.

&#x200B;

1. Firstly, Levi is so well written due to his consistency and contrast to the rest of the characters in the show. Levi sees titans as a non-threat; it is easy to slaughter them. He slices their napes in a blink of an eye (heh, one eye, if you know what i mean-), and is regarded as Paradis’ best soldier. This is seen in many examples, such as in season 3 episode 54, the iconic Levi vs Kenny scene, and unfortunately, season 4 episode 14.

This attitude towards titans is one of a kind, as other scouts fear titans immensely and shiver at their appearance. Additionally, his ability to murder titans is consistent, even in the last episode of the series, where he kills Zeke with two fingers, one eye, a bitten leg and various injuries. This demonstrates the true extent of his power.

&#x200B;

1. Additionally, Levi has clear motives towards his actions. Throughout his life, Levi has been a witness to the brutal murder of his comrades. Whether this be Petra and the others in season 2, Erwin in season 3, Hange and his scout group in season 4, or thousands of others; it has undoubtedly pushed him to keep surviving. He feels a need to give the dead’s lives meaning, which wouldn’t happen should he give up and not utilise his advanced power. Erwin’s final speech emphasises the importance of giving meaning to fallen comrades:

*“We die trusting the living who follow to find meaning in our lives!”*

This gives an explanation to why he continuously tries, gives his all and dedicates his heart in every battle.  


1. Moving on, before Erwin goes forward with his suicidal charge, Levi takes over Erwin’s guilt by ‘making the choice’ and making a promise to Erwin.  


“*Give up your dream and die. Lead the recruits straight into hell. I will take down the beast titan.”*

He attempts to acknowledge Erwin’s excellent and strategic leadership, as well as place honour in his death. This speaks to how important Erwin is to him. Therefore, killing Zeke, the beast titan, would be extremely important after Erwin’s death, especially with the loyalty Levi possesses.

&#x200B;

1. Finally, Levi’s character traits don’t align with his appearance. As stated before, Levi, canonically, is the most emotional character in Attack on Titan. However, his appearance says otherwise. He often presents as harsh. This can be seen in season 1, when he beats up Eren in court, or in the ‘Royal Government Arc’, where he puts his foot in an opponent’s mouth to get them speaking. However, in each of these instances, he had been fighting for a better cause. In the case of season 1, it was in order to stop Eren from being executed and dissected. In the Royal Government Arc, he needed to get answers in order to save Eren and Christa (Historia).

He can become significantly more brutal when facing his true enemies, such as Zeke. When first met with Zeke (out of beast titan form), Levi shoves a sword up the inside of his head. This, however, is justified and necessary as doing so instils fear in the opponent and Zeke had murdered thousands.

&#x200B;

1. On the inside, we can see that Levi is kind and caring; someone who truly cares for his comrades. This can be shown in season 2. In this season, the scout group closest to him is stamped on and thrown around by the Female Titan. Even the one arguably closest to him; Petra. Passing her body, he picks up her badge. Later in the mission, two devastated friends urge Levi to allow them to pick up their friend’s fallen corpse. In an effort to not lose any more comrades, Levi gives them the only memory of Petra left; her badge, and lies to them about who’s it really is. There are many other examples of Levi’s caring nature, such as in the end scene of AoT, where he is seen giving candy to children. This shows the audience that without his strength and the need to fight, Levi, deep down, wants to care for others. It reveals his loving nature.

&#x200B;

Perhaps, and this is just a theory, he would want to help others have a better life than him. A life without a childhood full of malnutrition, filth, violence and poverty. A life without an endless fight for freedom. A life with simple joys like lollipops. And most of all, a life without despair and sadness; a life where those closest to you aren’t killed before a proper goodbye.

&#x200B;

1. I believe that Levi is truly one of the most well crafted characters. His trauma and upbringing, as well as his empathetic and kind nature all contribute to a complex, interesting character. This is evident in the fact that fans all over the globe adore him. He isn’t just a pretty face or a stoic badass. He’s multi-dimensional.

To put it into simple words, Levi Ackerman’s title, “*Humanity’s strongest soldier”* describes him perfectly. Not only because of his faultless physical strength, but because of his endurance, perseverance, and personality.

&#x200B;

At first, I didn’t appreciate the complexity of Reiner’s character. I believe many can say the same. But looking back at the anime, it’s clear that Reiner was one of the most well-crafted characters in Attack On Titan. He is an embodiment of what can psychologically occur as a result of the dire conditions of conflict. And his charecter helped me go through my own transformation; a transformation of my perspectives on the various sides of war in AoT, which translated into reality.

&#x200B;

1. Firstly, we can observe how discrimination and social-environmental stressors play a role in Reiner’s character. As a young boy, Reiner was unloved by his father whom he was restricted from seeing. He was an illegitimate child of an Eldian woman and a Marleyan wife, and so was discriminated against for his race; as many others were. His mother, Karina, told him that he would live a great life; giving he’d train and become a Marleyan soldier. And so, he worked and trained to become one, despite a lack of strength. However, he learnt that he could never find love through his father; and needed something to keep him going. Here-forth, he adopted the idea of pushing on to protect the people of Marley, to ‘save the world.’

“*Everyone had to be drunk on somethin' to keep pushing on … everyone was a slave to somethin'. ” -* Kenny Ackerman

This gives an insight into Reiner’s motivations, and how unloving treatment from parents, as well as discrimination from society caused him to become a mess and become *drunk* on things not achievable - saving the world and being loved and accepted by his family.

1. Moving on, it is clear throughout the anime that Reiner has a split personality alongside survivor’s guilt. As mentioned above, Reiner invaded Paradis island to ‘save the world’ from the island devils. However, upon invasion of Paradis, it was clear that the ‘devils’ were far from evil; rather, they were kind hearted and, in many ways, just like him. Reiner discovers his whole life was spent in a weak, untruthful house. Now the roof had fell and the tiles had bruised him.

Not only did he have to deal with the realisation that there were no devils, but he also learnt that the reason he became a war candidate was Marcel’s attempts to save his brother. Shouldering the guilt of Marcel’s death, Reiner began to develop severe internal conflict.

1. His mission against the island ‘devils’ remained, but we see his acts of kindness on the island numerous times. In season 2, episode 4, Reiner saves Connie; despite him being an ‘enemy.’ These contradictory actions show the audience that Reiner is nothing but a victim; he had no choice in developing the beliefs and taking the actions he did. Knowing that he had to continue, Reiner copes with these disturbing situations, such as Marco’s death or his murder of thousands, by switching between personalities. This can be observed in season 2, episode 9; where he unknowingly switches between being a soldier and a strong Marleyan warrior. This highlights the impact of war and how no side is evil, rather, their perspectives are hidden from each-other. Being the one to discover this new perspective is, putting it in simple terms, a heavy burden to hold.  

2. Reiner becomes a source of hope almost; a symbolism to keep pushing on for *something*. As many other characters are, an embodiment of Kenny’s statement. Reiner was a slave to perseverance. No matter what he did, he could not die.

This is the part of the anime where many gained insight into Reiner’s place in the story and removed their negative view of his character. This discovery highlights how well foreshadowing and connections were done to ensure that Reiner’s personality, thoughts and actions matched up with his backstory and motivations in later seasons. Reiner has many more interesting characteristics up for exploration.

**Transformation of Perspective through Plot Twists**

In the duration between the releasing of an episode, I found it hard to not have AoT’s genius plot twists consume my thoughts with wonder and questions. Every once in a while, episodes left me in total shock. It took me a few hours to digest what I had just watched and the mechanics behind it.

One Episode that left me in a daze was season 4, episode 20. In this episode, we are brought to the paths where we learn Eren manipulated Grisha. This is introduced in such an immediate and blunt way.

*‘On your feet dad.’*

This changes the viewer’s perception of the whole series, causing the audience to suspect the motives of Grisha and how they view him as a character and father. Most of all, it creates a dilemma in the viewer - is Eren the antagonist or protagonist - is he ‘good’, or ‘evil’? This is something that can be subjective in the eyes of the viewer. This scene definitely demonstrates how far Eren goes to reach his goals, and his hopelessness of a perceived fixed timeline.

Another honourable mention is the reveal of the Colossal and Armoured titan. For me, this didn’t come as a total surprise. However, it was to many, and the execution; whether you could predict it or not, was perfect. The sudden statement Reiner makes is comical and casual.

*‘I’m the armoured titan, and he’s the colossal titan.’ -season 2, episode 6.*

Who would expect such a devastating discovery to come out in such a way? This makes the revelation all the more jaw-dropping and causes the audience to question the feelings, motivation and plan Reiner and Bertholdt have.

**Conclusion**

Overall, Attack On Titan is an anime I would recommend for all mature audiences. It leaves a mark on the viewer like no other piece of media. By delving into deep topics such as multiple sides of war, grief, brutality and decision-making - whilst balancing it with realistic, well-rounded characters, insights into relationships, and the beauty of life, it correctly represents the emotions and desires of humans. Despite including fantasy; The Titans, the anime manages to create a realistic anime of which many principles can be applied to reality. Various scenes can be described as cinematic masterpieces and challenge the stigma around anime. Most of all, the anime provides an example of how transformation can be used in all areas of a piece of media to improve the content.",False,manga,1705630285.0,19a7tna

Help me find a REALLY obscure anime from childhood,"Please I'm starting to think I might actually be insane because I keep looking for this really specific anime OVA/Movie that I swear I watched when I was a kid but every time I search for it I always find NOTHING.

The hard part about this is that I only remember really SPECIFIC scenes that stuck with me but not the plot itself? 

* First the scene that's stuck in my mind the most: There's definitely a scene where the main character (don't remember his appearance or demeanour at all) sees a disembodied corpse on the street after a car crash or something, the body was being transported by a vehicle and it's limbs might or might not have been in a bunch of jars full of blue liquid.

&#x200B;

* There's a war scene, probably at the beginning of the movie, I do remember tanks and also maybe mechas, but I'm not so sure about the mechas.

&#x200B;

* There's a scene with a girl with long pink hair standing in front of a cherry blossom tree, she probably disappears right after but I can't confirm if that's the case either.

&#x200B;

* And this scene is the weird one, I don't know if it's from the same movie? But it probably is, there's a weird vine guy, with plant powers I guess, they fight him, I remember him appearing really late on the movie when they're in some kind of cave and there's huge vines all over the place, again, this one is weird.

I was born in the 2000's in brazil (so it was probably dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese), might have watched when I was 5-9 years old, rented it from a video store and definitely didn't return it lol, at the time I also rented FF7:Advent children so that might help with the time frame, in my head this anime looked old, like from the 80s or 90s.

Hunter X Hunter arc discussion,"So I finished the Chimera Ant arc last week, and while I loved it, there were some issues I had with it that I think people over look; like how almost half of the arc sidelines Gon and Killua for no reason and characters like Pouf and Upie being nothing burgers. A friend of mine got talking about it, and we started thinking of a different kind of arc for what could've taken place after the Greed Island arc.

If the Chimera Ant arc was about the Phantom Troupe instead, and that was used for the big climactic showdown of Gon and Killua’s journey, along with some changes made to using already established characters and having more screen time given to Gon and Killua, and also some changes to stories and motivations, along with learning why some of the Troupe started living the life they do now in the first place, while still using the morality system of the Chimera Ant arc, do you think that’d be better, or worse, than what we got?

Cyberpunk genre in Anime?,"The cyberpunk genre is one of my favourites. I couldn't find many recommendations specific to this subgenre, because it gets put in the Sci-Fi category, which is very broad.

To clarify, Cyberpunk is characterised by high-tech, low life. Technology has advanced significantly and cybernetic implants, AI, digitizing consciousness, etc. are well developed. But, social order has basically collapsed and the police/government is controlled by a wealthy elite. The wealthy elite enjoys all the benefits of technology, while everyone else is treated as cattle/consumers. It's almost like a futuristic wild west.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!"" 

Weedwacker gave a interesting analysis on the men in black. *They're just faking being weirdos!!*
> **The men in black in Lain always reminded me of The X-Files.**  There's an episode from that show that aired two years before Lain
called  ""Jose Chung's From Outer Space"".  I've always wondered if Chiaki Konaka saw it. It's a more comedic than usual episode, but a couple scenes feature some ""men in black"" showing up 
to intimidate witnesses.  They are played by Jesse Ventura (Actor, Pro Wrestler, one-time Governor of Minnesota) and another fun cameo that i'll let [the video reveal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1K5Y1ZOZw8).

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      

Zadcap has been putting on the thinking goggles for Lain!
> Is Lain, um, doing a literal mental dive into the web? I really can't tell how much this scene is showing us random examples of what goes on on the web, or if this is supposed to be the Lain experience somehow. 

>So, Dad definitely knows what that chip is, and wants nothing to do with it. He entered her room and turned on the lights because he was ready to talk with her about something, but noped out as soon as he saw it. 

>Where have you bee*n lately?* This guy knows Lain by sight, and she is apparently actually a regular here. She plans the raves even? Oh my gosh, Other Lain is crazy. How did she end up with such an extreme personality split? 

> Oh my gosh even these kids know her by sight. And how was she in the Wired on her old kids Navi? I'm starting to think these Men In Black are keeping an eye on her for a very good reason, Lain might be quite a criminal in her alternate personality. 

> Okay that was the fastest we have ever seen Lain move at the end there, the most expressive she has ever been, and the most engaged with another person outside her obsession with Dead Friend. I'm thinking that the advanced computer is letting Wired Lain come to the surface more somehow?

Can’t find a specific boxing anime. Help pls?,"When I was a kid there was a boxing anime that came up on tv. I don’t remember much about it except this one episode. 

In that episode the MC is going up against an opponent whose gimmick is that he behaves like chess pieces. He is laying into the MC by changing up which piece he is acting like. The MC notices a piece on the opponents back and steals it in hopes of  being able to beat him. The pieces turns out to be a pawn and is pretty much useless. 

If it helps the main character has a circular face, bald head with a small pony tail and very fat lips. 

I can’t find any sign of this existing other than my memory of it. The only result that comes up  is Hajime no Ippo which definitely isn’t the anime I am looking for. 

I have asked everyone I know and ChatGPT as a last ditch effort. Does anyone know about this?",False,manga,1705613147.0,19a1c7f

Looking for Ecchi Anime recommendations,"Got into Anime a couple months ago for the “plot” and now I’m in it for that but also the ACTUAL plot. 

I’ve watched two Ecchis so far, Strike the Blood (which was phenomenal besides for season 4) and Highschool DxD (which I finished a couple days ago — I’m sad that there isn’t a season 5). 

Both in all honestly were kinda long for what I wanted, but I also don’t want to watch something super low-quality and confusing due to the lack of episodes. 

Here’s some things I’d like:

- Relatively short (3 seasons/36 episodes or less)
- No sex scenes, but nipples uncensored (don’t judge me)
- Average episode length is around 20 mins 
- Has supernatural stuff in it (demons, vampires, superpowers, whatever).

Stuff currently on my “list”, if this helps too (some might not meet the requirements posted above):

- How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend
- Hybrid x Heart Magias Academy Ataraxia
- Edens Zero
- Highschool of the Dead
- High-rise Invasion
- FairyTale 
- Kill la Kill 

Edit: has ENDED (so I’m not left on a cliffhanger/waiting for weekly episodes) 

If y’all have any suggestions let me know. Thanks again!",False,manga,1705612451.0,19a11sj

1) Has there ever been a piece of media that really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really deeply offended you on a personal level? If so, what?

2) On a scale of 1-10, how pathetic do you think Envy was by the end?

Bonus) Why didn't Roy just snap his fingers while Envy was in Ed's metal hand? It's not like it would have hurt him.

Are there any anime ABOUT fighting games?,"I'm not talking about anime that feature fighting games in them, nor anime based on fighting games. I mean an anime where the main focus is playing focus is playing fighting games. Cause it feels weird that after all these years, I have yet to hear of even one. Fighting Games are basically the closest real world equivalent we have to being in a Shonen anime, aside from like Boxing or something. That feeling of always striving to improve, never giving up even in the most dire circumstances, the intense mental gymnastics mixed, along with requiring the physical execution to actually play out that plan, all leading up to a big tournament with thousands of people in the audience.

Between that, and the popularity of sports anime as well as stuff like Yu-Gi-Oh, a fighting game anime should be an obvious choice. But I have yet to hear of one.

Trying to Predict Crunchyroll Award Winners 2024,"Just wanna do some predictions.

Anime of The Year:  It's tied between Oshi no Ko and Vinland Saga 2 as these have not won on this category before and these two has unique stories although based on previous winners which are all popular, it might be Chainsawman. JJK is popular but already won before. Surprised AOT isn't nominated but it already won before so I think it would not win nonetheless.

Best Continuting Anime: AOT because it has an ending and can be a send off to the series. Even though One Piece has been great this year, it already won before for this category.

Best Animation: I don't know how this will go. Keep your hands of Eizouken! won before so maybe Trigun would win this for it's unique showcase of 3D animation. Mob and Demon Slayer already won on this category so I'm counting them out.

I think it's got some magical elements but I might really just be thinking of something else similar. Its been a few years since I've watched it and I can't remember the name.

I am looking for a very specific animated movie from 1981," 

Hi Everyone,

I had the chance to watch a movie when I was younger, that I have been looking for my whole life. I am especially trying to find the music from the end credits of this movie. The song seems to be stuck in my head and actually pops up at the most unexpected moments...

After many hours of looking, it took me about 14 years to figure out the movie it might be. The name of the movie is ""Undersea Encounter"". It was in english; the original is actually Japanese...it's called "" War Under the Sea: *20,000* Leagues of Love. 海底大戦争 愛の*20,000*マイル (Japanese) ""

Ive been looking for the song that plays during the end credits of the movie. It starts with the words    ""Under the Sea..."" <During this part of the music, 2 seagulls can be seen flying across the screen. These are the only things I actually remember very vividly, the words after this are kind of lost to memory.

When it was released in 1981, it was dubbed into many languages, and as the language changed, the soundtrack got changed as well. The version I'm looking for is held by an American company called Harmony Gold. I've been able to find the Japanese, Latino and French versions of the movie, Online, on youtube, but the music I am looking for isn't on them. The 2 seagulls are there, but the music is very different.

If anybody does find the song, somewhere, I'd be happy to hear it, too.

Thank you.",False,manga,1705579014.0,199oi78

Anime suggestion with people who STRUGGLE,"Allow me to elaborate. I loved Fire Punch, SAO Abridged, Chainsawman, Welcome to tge NHK, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, Library of Ruina, Limbus Company, Kaiji, etc.

I'm looking for SOMETHING, throw it all, anime, manga, movies, videogames, whatever, about terrible people. People who barely manage to classify a human beings with how dysfunctional they are. Be it mental illness, biases, upbringing, doesn't matter, if they are complex sociopaths, better. I want to see people who are at their absolute worst, but not in an overly exaggerated way like, Kuzu no Honkai for example which is pretty much just a soap opera. Those are welcome too of course so feel free to recommend but I mostly want a series based on people professionally shooting themselves on the foot, that their failures come not only from the struggle they face but from having to deal with their own mishaps as human beings, that when someone truly fails it actually sticks, that the consequences of their actions create waves that resonate across the whole story.

I want to see people who truly struggle to do the right thing not just because of moral quandaries but because it goes against their very own, faulty nature. I want to see frigging Johan Liebert, against his better judgement, without any drive to do so, try to straighten his path even without any certainty of ever achieving it or any hope of him being satisfied in the end, only because it's the right thing to do and even the smallest of attempts could be worth something. 

And ABOVE ALL OTHER THINGS, I also want to see these failures, these complete wastes of air, fight their way through all this to find themselves somewhere better than where they started, even if only slightly so. I've seen plenty of sad stories of people who reap what they sow. Now I want to see people who actually manage to break through the shackles they placed on themselves to be better, who knowing that the cards are stacked against them by their own hands, they will still try to be better.

I know this was rambly and sometimes redundant but I'm looking for a very specific kind of story and I really hope someone here can help me.",False,manga,1705547513.0,199g14r

Just remembered these two animes and I git no idea what the names for them are,"So, I suddenly remembered these 2 different anines and ig ot no idea what their names are :[

So, first one what of this magic girl anime, pink wand that kinda looks liek starts forms tar vs the forces of evil

One of the character son the later seasons look like nagatoro, who turns out to be some kinda clone of the main character

It also has a very heavy make out scene between two of the girls- it was while they were shopping and it was to get mana so one of them doesnt freaking die, so idk if that'll help tho

The Mc was white, blonde hair, blue eyes. They end up also going to some weird dark world in a giant castle to save thier brother or smth?

The SECOND one is of this little girl who escapes this tetsing facility and sues magic via crystals and gets found by this old man who acts liek ehr father figure n stuff

One character has magic based off of her dead husband, he was like thes etwo balls ghost hands that were always around her-
Anyways the girl ends up passing out and they take her back to the facility to help her I think.

There's these 2 twins who were her bffs with the main nd they could like, create imagination worlds or smth",False,manga,1705546176.0,199fkhk

"Are there any anime that outright go ""it's not just the 'Bad Guys', the entire structure of our world is the problem""?","So I was watching [HBomberguy's video concerning RWBY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81fdKWOHrdE) (not anime I know, but humor me here) and part of the video that resonated with me was how the RWBY creative team *tried* to do a political message with the Faunus - basically racism against beastmen - but half-assed it because they only took the most basic tropes and played it safe with the implementation. The fact that a society is biased against Fauni aren't the problem, it's just that some people are bad and if those bad people are gone then everything will magically go back to normal and we can go back to pretending nothing bad is going on. 

Anime-wise, I noticed this a bunch with some shonen anime. Naruto had a whole society based off child soldiers, but when he saved the world and caused peace between all the nations... they still train child soldiers. My Hero Academia has established problems with hero society, but they're mostly pushed to the side to focus on AFO and Shigaraki because *they're* the problem and once they're jailed, society will go back to normal. And this isn't even an anime-exclusive thing - Harry Potter spends like seven books showing issues plaguing the wizarding world, issues that aren't solely tied to Voldemort alone, but we're just supposed to believe that once Voldemort was dead all the problems with the HP world would just evaporate and Harry wouldn't need to change anything in his life afterwards. He's just an ordinary trust fund baby that grew into a cop.

Anyway, I know that intro was me trying to find a solid definition for what I'm looking for, but in general I'm looking for anime and manga which *don't* just push all the issues plaguing the world on one set of bad guys - instead acknowledging that their society caused the issues that created the bad guys, and they work to fix that.

My criticism of A Silent Voice,"Before you say “You just didn’t understand it”, I will say I watched this movie twice and I hated it both times. No better time than any to join in and discuss what I disliked so much. 

Shouko - She is hardly a character at all. We don’t get to learn about her wants or goals other than having a crush on her childhood tormentor. Never does she really grow a spine either, and decides to then commit suicide because she feels like a burden. Nothing more than a plot device and vehicle for your sympathy. She doesn’t get to overcome anything on her own, and is basically static.  

Ueno and the other blonde- Quite possibly some of the most insufferable caricatures I have ever had the displeasure of watching. They needlessly make the runtime even longer by inciting the forced drama in their friend group. And yet they don’t even get any consequences at the end. The just kind of laugh it off like Ueno’s bullying didn’t just lead to a suicide attempt by Shouko. 

Shoya honestly doesn’t deserve to given ALL the redemption he gets either. Sure he tries to make amends, but the movie forgets all the shitty things he did to her because “oho she now has a crush on him”. It doesn’t make sense, Shouko would be better off standing up for herself and cutting off the sources of toxicity. 

It bewilders me that this isn’t talked about more. I am not a fan of seeing suffering that could be so easily avoided.",False,manga,1705529046.0,19996i4

> ""The one where Alice corrupts Lain at the [Gay Bar.""](https://youtu.be/yq0_ApTwNH4?si=7fHyu2r86xLlbrmZ) 

RadSuit was heavily distracted by her ""Lainzy eye~
>""Lain's eyes are off in the next closeup as well.  [](#watashiworried)

>And now it's clearly seen on her in a normal shot of her entire face.  Her left eye is way lower than her right eye.

>I had to stop and go back to episode one to check.  She's always drawn like this, actually.  Googling her shows it in every other pic as well, I just didn't notice until now.  I'm not sure if it's just the art style, or if it's actually a physical thing that will get mentioned later.

Quiddity just came out and said that Lain was a lonely girl with no friends... 

> No new email for Lain. She's not very popular. Even among spammers and scammers.

Esovan13 gets a call out for the frankly badass phrase, ""miasma wave"" 
>This is only episode two and based on my previous track record with predicting stuff, it's very likely that everything I wrote is completely off the mark. Still. Very big vibes this show has. I think someone in the KnK rewatch used the term miasma wave to describe the vibes over there, and I think this falls into a similar sphere. Maybe like a techno-miasma wave. There's probably a better term for it than that, but those are the vibes I'm getting.

And Degen went totally wild as the ""you're getting a Dell!?"" throwback. 
>""okay I gotta take a moment to spin off of this point: one thing about Cyberpunk is the ""in the future, we'll all be gross nerds jarging about our fragtimes on the netform, bragging about having the fastest clocktech on the mark',"" thing. Which, uh. That happened? People talk about their computer and phone specs like it's just normal. That's the important part I think. Sci-fi might give the impression that ""wow, the future will be weird"" even when trying to convey that the future will be perfectly ordinary.""

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      

Specs64z was able to simplify the episodes events in a far more digestable way than the actual show did. 

> Lain’s obsession with Chisa’s emails continues. Her sister comments about Lain’s “invisible friend”, presumably Chisa. She also isn’t the least bit interested in socializing. This culminates in another vision where Chisa haunts Lain, this one far more visceral than before.

> Finding her inbox empty, Lain leaves her new setup behind and decides to head to Cyberia. However, things take a dark turn when a man guns down 2 women in the club. Lain stands frozen in fear as the others run to safety, watching the blood pool. The man turns his attention to the unmoving Lain, but for some reason her face strikes fear into his heart. He calls her a scattered god, blames her for apparently forcing his actions, and implies the Wired is involved with the current situation.

> ""No matter where you go, everyone’s connected.""

> An authoritative voice that barely seems to belong to the shy, soft-spoken Lain. The man kills himself immediately afterward.

2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team (2021),"Plot - After everything that’s happened, can the ace pair be reunited? Genius setter Kimichika Haijima and team ace Yuni Kuroba were a duo on and off the volleyball court. But at the last tournament of middle school, the two begin fighting and end their friendship. Now in high school, they are forced to meet on the same side of the net. They’ll need to work things out if they want a chance at Nationals.

My Thoughts - I liked the intro, but the outro wasn't the greatest. I love volleyball, but never got the chance to endulge my interest, so I settle for volleyball animes, but I enjoy it. Overall I can see how this could be hard to get into. The characters weren't the best, however by the end of this, I found myself wanting more. I would love to see this anime continue if it isn't already but for what it is, I didn't regret watching it and wouldn't mind binging it again. 

My Rating - 3.5 out of 5 Cherry Blossoms

What are your thoughts on this anime?

A Silent Voice Rant,"I'm just feeling inspired by the discourse that blew up on Twitter 1-2 days ago surrounding one person's negative opinion on A Silence Voice. I've hated this movie ever since I watched it 6-7 years ago, but I've never tried to fully explore the reasons why I didn't like it.

Reasons why I dislike it:

1. Some character behavior and scenarios feel unrealistic from a logical perspective. 

* A woman was brought in to tell the class to learn sign language. This is just too *stupidly* considerate of Shouko, especially when regular schools are more notorious for being unaccommodating to people with disabilities. EDIT: I just thought of an analogy to this. If you have a new student at your American school who can only speak Japanese, the teachers aren't going to make the class learn Japanese for the new student's sake. So what happened in the movie is just so stupid. The author ran out of ideas on how to make the bullies gradually hate her and that was the shit they came up with.

* Shouko sees herself as a burden and feels guilty about everything but still tries to sing in the choir. She can't not know that she's highly likely to ruin it for everyone else. And apparently choirs are extracurricular in Japanese schools, so she didn't even have to be in it!? It's just so hard to believe that she, who sees herself as a burden, would actively try to be a burden to others.
 
2. The ugly male mc has 2 cute girls crushing on him. Reason why I hate it should be self-explanatory. Shouya is just a self-insert for reformed male bullies 

3. Ueno and Tomohiro. It's impressive how one movie contains the most detestable and cringy-est characters (respectively) I've seen in anime. EDIT: I know why Ueno and Kawai are written that way if you misunderstand me

* Ueno is just so, so awful, which I don't feel like I need to explain here. Kawai is also quite bad but she doesn't elicit the same rage in me. It's just so frustrating how Ueno and Kawai have to be included in the friend group at the end when they didn't grow much as people. The movie should've also shown how it's perfectly okay to cut out toxic people from your life. 

4. This wasn't really one of my reasons but I've seen others say how the movie is exploitive of Shouko and I can kind of see why now that I think about it

* Her suicide attempt gave Shouya a heroic moment because learning sign language isn't apparently enough to earn forgiveness EDIT: Story would still be the same if shouko jumped and survive the fall like shouya did

* Her lack of self-worth and life of mistreatment made it easy for Shouya to add 1 more girl to his ""harem"" (I'm kind of joking here). But it did make her more easily to reconcile with

"Looking for a certain anime (20+ years old, victorian england + libraries setting)","So it would have come out before 2005, and it was good. It featured I believe Victorian England protagonists, mostly girls IIRC, doing semi-magical things related to powers coming from books or libraries, if I remember. I can't get it out of my head. The art style and plot was something to be remembered.

I searched for Vic era anime, but couldn't find the exact one. Anyone have any clue what it could be? If it turned out to be Edwardian England, my apologies.",False,manga,1705525210.0,1997ll3

Trying to remember an anime.,"I forgot a title of an anime and I cant seems to remember what the main plot is. What i remember is that the MC befriended a half dwarf with glasses when they got betrayed during their adventuring duties. The one that betrays them came from a noble family and they even tried to sue the MC and the MC even paid for the enrollment of the half dwarf friend. 

Other info I remember is that the MC is strong.

"Fuck it, I like Higurashi Gou and Sotsu.","I see Higurashi Gou and Sotsu get panned quite frequently in the anime community, but honestly I really like the newer seasons. Ever since Kai was released, I felt as if Higurashi was heavily sanitized… even Outbreak was mild compared to the original 2006 anime. 

GouSotsu brought back the cute-terrifying dynamic that caused me to fall in love with the original anime while also continuing the story that Kai established. Hell, that fact that they even went as far as to lure you into a false sense of security with censored violence in the beginning only to slap the audience with some of the most gruesome and shocking scenes I’ve seen in anime completely caught me off guard.

I know a lot of people didn’t like where they took Satoko’s character but honestly, it kind of makes sense? Obviously, Rika wanted to get out of Hinamizawa once she found a perfect world… considering she spent 100 years being gruesomely murdered by her friends. The fact that Satoko has become so attached to Rika that she is willing to betray her in order to keep her around fits the series well, especially since the story already established that characters may retain memories from previous fragments.",False,manga,1705521251.0,1995xh5

Did Pluto need to be a reinterpretation/reimagining of Astroboy? [Spoilers for Pluto],"Before Pluto aired, I wanted to ""know"" what kind of the story the World's Greatest Robot is. What could have inspired Urusawa and what kind of deviations would naturally occur because of his own writing style. (I read the manga chapter, watched the 1980 and 2003 versions of events)

But after seeing both and thinking about it, I gotta wonder if Pluto ever needed to be tied with the Astroboy lore when it's almost just completely different. 

Urusawa tries to match some scenes like the climax of the WGR story to the climax of Pluto, but recontextualized, but they're not even remotely the same. The story Urusawa told with Pluto was so different from Osamu Tezuka's writing style that, and I'm not sure if this is the same for everyone, the climax of Pluto felt out of place. 

Narratively it still ""fit"" as the culmination of the grand mystery, but watching it actually unfold felt completely different from the strongest parts of Pluto (delving into the psychological and philosophical meaning of life using Robots), which was 100% was added by Urusawa. 

The changes can even go as far as the entire dynamic between Tenma and Atom. Of course, Urusawa isn't the first person to change up the reason why Tenma became estranged from Atom. In the original manga it was literally because Atom couldn't grow up... A robot couldn't grow up. I don't really mind changing stuff like that since that kind of reasoning would look absolutely stupid in something like Pluto, but again, why did it need to be tied to Astroboy in the first place?

Even the 7 great Robots. North no.2 is nothing like his MGR counterpart aside from the designs. Each Robot aside from the first one was featured with very human designs and Gejihito's entire story made him a completely different character. He's no longer out for justice, he's tackling his own issues relating to hatred. 

Any other similarities I could find are purely surface level. Gejihito's armor being named Zeronium. Character names. The character designs when they're actually in Robot form. General setting and whatnot.  

It's just... So different- obviously, both works should be treated like their own works. Pluto is not meant to be Astroboy so it shouldn't be looked at as an Astroboy remake, but then why did Urusawa do that in the first place instead of just completely detaching from the Astroboy name?

Right now, my only guess is that Urusawa really was inspired by the MGR story and wanted to make his own interpretation of it. Because he really did like the story, he wanted to give it the same name as a way of paying homage to the source. 

This isn't me trying to throw shade on either of the stories. They just feel like completely different works made by completely different people because they literally are, and the attachment of the astroboy name feels a bit.. I don't know the word for it. It's not weird, something closer to ""Awkward"" if that makes sense?",False,manga,1705502527.0,198y32c

"Who had your favorite breakout success in the anime industry, and what was it?","By ""breakout success,"" I'm not necessarily referring to someone's first project. It could be any work that caused someone to gain more attention from others in the industry and the public at large. [Kevin Penkin](https://anilist.co/staff/121796/Kevin-Penkin), for instance, really made a splash with his soundtrack for *Made in Abyss*, and now his name is attached to several other notable projects. [Keiichirou Saitou](https://anilist.co/staff/134254/Keiichirou-Saitou), meanwhile, made his directorial debut with *Bocchi the Rock!* to widespread acclaim, leading almost directly into his work on *Frieren* this season.

Personally, I can't think of a better example of a rise to stardom than [Yuusuke Kobayashi](https://anilist.co/staff/118407/Yuusuke-Kobayashi), for his breakout performance as Subaru in *Re:Zero*. Subaru wasn't his first lead role, but it's almost absurd how quickly it became the one that would secure him a place in the industry. It ended up being the defining moment of his career, leading him to win the 11th Seiyū Award for Best New Actor and to gain a lot of opportunities from then onward. The fact that he got his start as a VA somewhat later in life and took it upon himself to pursue what he was passionate about only makes it more fitting, IMO, that Subaru was the role that got him there. He *is* Subaru, in more ways than one.",False,manga,1705501018.0,198xjl4

What’s the most underrated anime airing right now?,"Personally for me it’s Undead Unluck. Last season it got very little traction despite having such gorgeous scenes and some great characters.

Need help finding an old anime,"So I’m trying to find this anime that I likely watched in the early 90s. As far as I can remember, it’s set in feudal Japan with some magical/demonic elements. Based on my own research, I thought it was Yotoden/Wrath of the Ninja, but I scrolled through it on YouTube and it seems to be missing this one scene I remember: 

As I recall, a boy is in a forest and he eats some berries or grapes or something. The berries turn out to actually be stones that have been…illusioned? He spits them out and yells at some monkey-esque creatures for tricking him. 

That scene is what I remember most. Trying to fill in other details, there might have been a girl as well. The boy may have had like a blowgun? I feel like there was also a demonic king or something they had to defeat, but maybe I’m combining things in my brain.

Anime Recommendations for a returnee anime watcher,"I haven't watched anime in around 9/10 years. It feels long. There are probably so much animes that came out now. My favourite anime was Natsume's Book of Friends, can anyone recommend anything like it maybe or close to that? it doesn't have to be about Yokai. I don't mind maybe romance too (as long as it's a female protagonist and about male love interest/s).

Caliburn's weapon from Gundam Witch from Mercury (charge up and nice metallic sound)

The charge based rifle on the Unicorn Gundam (weapon he obtains after arriving on Nahel Argama) in MSG Unicorn RE:0096 (nice decrescendo)

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
First Comment of the season goes to DragonPup with some handy info on defunct operating systems that went over my head~
> ""So I am going to absolutely age myself here in a bad way, but the series had so many references to [BeOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS) and [NeXTSTEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP), the 2 'competing' operating systems to what would be the next generation Macintosh operating system. NeXTSTEP won, brought Steve Jobs back to Apple and became OS X. The rest is history.""

Weedwacker also came out with some advice to try watching the show with headphones if you can. 
>""**Highly recommend if you aren't to be watching this show with headphones**.  You need to immerse yourself in this show and there is so much going on with the music and sound work that is quiet which you might miss watching this on a television."" 

And JetsLag on the subject of Bocchi Bear vs Lain bear!! 

> Bocchi's bear onesie totally wouldn't have happened if Lain hadn't revolutionised the animal pyjama scene!!

> Bocchi is standing on the shoulders of giants, but that does make her taller.

rumblpak thinks this rewatch group needs to stay up 24h to become delerious enough to appreciate Lain. We broke the delerium banner with Kodomo no Jikan and ""Tanaka, drink my pee!"" 
>The correct way to watch this is to stay up for a full 24 hours, then start a binge watch until complete. 
>The comments deserve a certain amount of delirium in this case lol

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!"" 

3blah scores our first win of the season! I'd clap but clapping Chisa's mad flipping skills is probably a bit insensitive. 

>""Chisa about to jump: Just before we saw Chisa on the street.  It's busy and loud.  She's uncomfortable and out of breath.  But up on the roof she's at peace.  I think this might be one of the few (the only?) outdoor shots without those power lines.  She smiles and lets her hair down to blow in the wind.  After a brief moment of silence, she crashes back to the loud, busy street.  It's a quite dramatic way to get the audience's attention to start things off.""

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      

Zadcap, a first timer, went really in depth looking into the goals behind Lain as a project 

> ""After finishing this episode I did take a look into the creator guy, and apparently one of the things he made this series for was to spark a discussion between the Japanese and American influences warring in their culture at the time. He very much wanted us to see this show and talk about it, and starting off with a lot of very coherent English probably did help.

Lain's eyes, and everyone else's *lips*, they bother me so much. Lain just keeps her eyes held so far open and the detail on them is very uncanny valley, and I guess I just hate lips in general and don't like seeing them drawn with detail but they just keep doing it here. It's not all the art, it's the way the people are drawn, it's just giving me dislike vibes.

Anime without plot armor,"Hey there. I’ve really enjoyed Game of Thrones, Attack on Titan and recently caught up on the JJK anime. I also really liked Eighty Six. 

I really enjoy anime where there’s some lack of plot armor. I like it when authors build up a character and then rip it away from you. It makes the conflicts have higher stakes and there isn’t always an “easy” fix that is due to an angry power up (DBZ, Naruto). I also hate how no fan favoritecharacters will actually die (byakuya in latest bleach arc).

Trying to discover an old cartoon/anime,"Im new to reddit, so not sure this is the right sub to be posting in. But im going to try anyways.

I'm currently looking for an old cartoon/anime, that I used to watch (probably between 2011 and 2015). I've spent HOURS trying to find it but with no luck. I think it was an anime, but in a more Western type of style (??). I don´t remember what the entire series was about, but here are the few things that I do remember. 

There were three chracter, two boys and a girl, wiht one of the boys being the main character. The girl had blue hair nad i think she was called ""Maya"". The three characters live and go to school in this academy where they have an older mentor, who also taugh the main characters father. Pretty sure the main characters mother is dead, and its presumed his father is too, undtil one of the later episodes reveal him to be alive.

The trio can turn into these robot/animal hybrids, and they acquire special powers along with the transformation. The blue-haired girl could transform into either an eagle/hawk or a snake, (can't remember which one of the girls from the series transforms into which animal). Just to clarify, they physically turn into the robot/animal hybrid and become one with it. They aren´t controlling them via a remote controller and we don't see them from inside the robot.

The main trio has a rival trio that also consists of two boys and one girl, who also have the robot hybrid powers and transformations. Every time the two trios meet, they battle. Before each battle, I vividly remember the two ""main leaders"" from each trio, saying something along the lines of ""Challenge accepted!"" while having one fist closed and the other hand covering the fist while saying it.

I hope someone knows what I'm talking about and can help me find the name of this series. If this post isn't appropriate for this subreddit, please let me know.

What is stopping you from reading manga the same way you consume anime?,"Most of the people I've talked to who watch anime usually only casually read a few popular manga or none at all.

In contrast, almost all manga readers I've interacted with started off as anime-onlies but eventually transitioned to consuming manga more compared to anime(myself included).

I couldn't really find a discussion on this topic in either forums so decided to ask this here:

For **Anime Only/Mainly** \- What's holding you back from reading more manga?

For **Manga-readers -**  what were the reasons for shifting your consumption of media towards manga?

Need help finding a anime I remembered long ago.,"So I watched this one a long time ago when I was smaller so I could be remembering wrong. I remember it watching it int he early to mid 2000s. The plot takes place in night where a team had to explore a building for something. Was it to search for something or find something I can't remember. What I remember that two of them stay outside, and all of them had mechs to drive in to explore tthis abandon building. None of the characters had that cutesy look to them and the mechs were less of VOTOMS, Gundam, and Patlabor and reminds me more of a Iron Harvest design look where the main body was cylinderish shaped with arms and legs, and the hands ended with two fingers and a thumb in a claw machine fashion. They were not that big either considering they were like maybe enough space to hold the pilot in the main body and nothing else. They explore this location, the more badass looking clothed lady does her own exploring thing and spooky things happen. I can't remember all of it but I do remember one where they hop across a small cavern in the floor, and the other girl decided to jump down it for a reason. More spooky things happen. The badass looking lady has a nightmare and wakes u and encounters the other girl and they say something before Badass lady escapes. And then near the end I remember the part where it turned out the building itself is actually a flesh monster thing in disguise and it raises out of the ground to its true height. Characters have no idea what to do, but badass lady who was too busy climbing a flesh tunnel see's another tunnel that was shining with something important goes there and just twists a certain spot in the flesh place and it kills the monster building thing. I know that sounds weird on what I remember but I vividly remember watching it and remembering those scenes. These memories have been floating around my head for many years now and I just want to know what it is. Any ideas on what I could have watched?",False,manga,1705429595.0,1989xn1

Looking for Anime that feels like an Epic!,"So, just like the title, I'm looking fot an anime that feels like an Epic. Something reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings where it may start off small, but as the story moves along, the scale absolutely explodes beyond compare! 

I'm hoping to find one already complete with a definitive ending that doesn't feel open ended and with a relatively clear cut ""Good guy vs Bad guy"" side. Also want it to be not too dark. It can have dark elements, but at the end of the story It'll still come off as hopeful or inspiring. 

The genre doesn't need to be anything specific, but having any kind of supernatural/fantastical elements would be great. 

Having some bad guys be sympathetic is fine, but I dont want it to be like AOT where it doesn't feel like anyone's good, and any choice will lead to pain regardless. And that everyone is evil as much as they are good. Nothing gray to that extent. 

A similar one I got to experience was FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood. The way things unfolded really stuck with me. 

It's kindve childish cause it literally is ""Adventure leading to a massive climactic battle with the friends we made along the way,"" but I'm very much looking for that awesome story right now. 

Re:Zero I would kindve put here, but it's still cooking. 

Mushoku Tensei has the world, but so far, it doesn't seem like it's shaping up to being a grand epic more than it is just the life of Rudeus Greyrat. 

Also both shows are not complete yet. 

One Piece isn't complete yet. 

I think Naruto counts? I haven't seen it since I was a child. 

OH!! Fate/Grand Order's anime adaptations absolutely gave me the vibes I was looking for!

Totally the type of story where when your old and you tell the kids of the future about an epic tale from the long distant past and you get all sentimental over it... THAT FEELING! ",False,manga,1705424839.0,1987x9o

"To those who consider Mob Psycho 100 a 100/100, what parts of this show do you enjoy most?","To me, Mob Psycho 100 is a great show. Not “best of all time” good, but still pretty good.

My first reactions for all parts: (spoilers for the whole series):

First two episodes: Nice start. I hope it won’t become episodic though.

Third episode: Finally, we see Mob going 100%!

Fourth and Fifth episodes: Wow, this ???% kinda looks cool.

Sixth to seventh episodes: Nice to see Ritsu getting superpowers and getting to know his brother a bit better.

Eighth episode to the last episode of season one: That’s some great villains and great fights here. I’m excited for their boss to properly introduced in later seasons.

Season two episode one: Nice episode, but doesn’t seem like to have much impact on later episodes.

Episodes two and three: Interesting to see the show tackled a bit more about humanity.

Mogami’s arc: That’s some terrifying stuff. Mogami is a terrifying villain, and this is easily the darkest arc of the series.

Reigen’s arc: We finally get to know more about Reigen, and the last scene of this arc is really touching.

Claw’s return arc: This arc contains some of the greatest fights in the series. And we finally get to see Mob vs Toichiro, which is what I have been expecting to see since season one. Definitely the most shounen-like arc in the series.

Divine Tree arc: I would say this arc started a bit slow, but once God Dimple is introduced, it gets interesting. Dimple had great character development in this arc, the fights are awesome, and the ending is a bit sad.

Aliens arc: It felt like a filler arc to me, but it did a good job at giving the Telepathy Club some much-deserved screentime, and I like how trippy it feels during the end.

??? arc: This is where I finally got to love this show. The true nature of ???% Mob is finally revealed, and most importantly, every main character got some great character development in this arc. I won’t say the ending is one of the best endings in anime, but it is indeed a proper one to finish the series.",False,manga,1705417927.0,198545p

Dark Anime Recommendations from r/anime,"So I **asked** r/anime for **Dark Anime Recommendations**:

https://preview.redd.it/ke7bmvxhhtcc1.png?width=871&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeefcb1001cc6a7305a48c4801515c69c9f9b109

From the **Recommendations** I picked the below Animes:

  **1) Blood C          2)Death Parade      3)Goblin Slayer           4)Akame Ga Kill**   


Then I **asked MSFT Copilot**: 

""*Compare the above animes based on my criteria and* ***give them a rating*** *from* ***1 to 10****. 10 is the highest.""* 

'Copilot:   
Hello, thank you for your question. Based on your criteria, I will compare the four animes you listed and give them a rating from 1 to 10. Here is my evaluation:

* **Blood C**: This anime is very dark and graphic, with a lot of gore and violence. It has a twist ending that reveals the true nature of the main character and the world she lives in. However, it also has a lot of flaws, such as poor pacing, inconsistent tone, and shallow characters. Some people may find it too disturbing or nonsensical. [I would give it a 4 out of 10](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10490/Blood-C/reviews)
* **Death Parade**: This anime is dark in thought, as it explores the moral dilemmas and psychological states of people who die and are judged by a mysterious arbiter. It has some emotional and philosophical moments, as well as some suspenseful and thrilling games. However, it also has some filler episodes, uneven animation quality, and a lack of closure for some characters. [I would give it a 7 out of 10](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10490/Blood-C/reviews)
* **Goblin Slayer**: This anime is dark and graphic, as it depicts the brutal and merciless battles between the goblin slayer and his enemies. It has some realistic and gritty aspects, as well as some fantasy and adventure elements. However, it also has some controversial and unnecessary scenes, such as rape and fanservice. It also has a simple and predictable plot, and a generic and bland protagonist. [I would give it a 6 out of 10](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10490/Blood-C/reviews)
* **Akame Ga Kill**: This anime is dark and graphic, as it shows the bloody and tragic fate of a group of assassins who fight against a corrupt and evil empire. It has some action and comedy scenes, as well as some plot twists and surprises. However, it also has a lot of problems, such as rushed and inconsistent pacing, poor character development, and a disappointing and original ending that deviates from the manga. [I would give it a 5 out of 10](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10490/Blood-C/reviews)

Based on my ratings, I would say that Death Parade is the best anime among the four, followed by Goblin Slayer, Akame Ga Kill, and Blood C. However, these ratings are based on my own opinion and the reviews I found online. You may have a different preference or perspective, so I suggest you watch the anime yourself and form your own judgment. I hope this helps. Have a nice day.'

Top 20 romcom anime video,"Greetings, people of this sub. So for the past couple years I have been making video edits, most of which are music videos, but this year I'd like to give a shot at something I've never done before: Doing a Top 20 Countdown video where, in this case, I'll count down my picks for the top 20 romcom anime. But before I actually do it, there are several things that I need to clear out first. 

- For starters, I'm not okay (like, at all) with revealing my voice on the Internet, so my elaboration on each of my picks will purely be done by text on screen. But if you guys prefer narration, please let me know if there are any alternatives
- Also, my video won't be like other countdown videos. I'm planning to make it like a sort of documentary-style reality show episode, and I'll have a lot to say for each pick with some witty and funny one-liners thrown into the mix. As such, I'm pretty sure the finished product would be over 45 minutes long, so I'm going to release it in parts
- Thirdly, as with all countdown videos, this is based on personal opinion, but I'll try to be rational at the same time, basing my picks off statistics and what the general public has to say about it. That way, the list will look more agreeable while also having some of my own thoughts about each show
- And one more thing, should I flair the countdown videos under ""Video"" or ""Video Edit""? Cause at the moment I'm a little confused.

And that's all I have to say for now. What are your thoughts about this? Should I go for it? Please share your thoughts in the comments.",False,manga,1705417305.0,1984vj3

So the details I saw was, the MC (I believe) is kinda old with a lady, which he said, ""I dont know if its rude to ask but how old are you?""(or something) and the lady said something bout being underage and MC was really shocked. The environment was like a really fancy restaurant and they were wearing something formal, then as I was looking at comments there were details like ""dude only wants to take care of birds"" or ""he got the wrong rizz"" or ""its not illegal if its on another world"" and such

Amazing attention to detail in The Dangers in My Heart S2 OP,"I'm sure everyone who watches Bokuyaba S2 can agree how much thoughts and effort were put into the animation, the little detail and easter eggs they put in such as \[S1 Spoiler\]>!Milk tea bottle and magazine!<, and the freaking orbital shot dancing scene.

**BUT!!!**   
The scene that really blown me away is during the [bicycle scene](https://imgur.com/ZK1Hu2t), the bottom left of the frame shows the sun lens flare at first, and when Yamada's head blocks the sun, the flare disappear and reappear once the sun is not blocked. When I watch it for the first time I thought to myself, ""Man, they don't have to go this hard for a romance anime opening song"".

But yeah, just a little post to show how amazed I am and appreciation for the director of the opening, Tetsuro Araki and the staffs who works on the project. Really happy of how much care and effort they put into one of my favourite anime. 

I encourage people who haven't watch it or dropped it on the first episode to pick it up, you won't regret it, one of the best romance anime that shows progression, with no love triangle BS.

Here's the [opening music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0tKGpKOU4Y) for the curious.

Thanks

"I watched the new Kizumonogatari compilation film, a brief summary of changes","Spoilers for the original movies and this compilation film. I haven't read the novel, and to be fair I haven't watched the movies in years, so I'm going off my memory and the Wikipedia summary to refresh that memory.

I really enjoyed the compilation film. I was excited to see it on a big screen and it lived up to that excitement- just gorgeous. But that's no different than the original. 

Feels like the least was cut from the first movie, the long scenes of no or low dialogue i remembered loving were all kept. Like the slow opening that leads to him on fire in the sun which aside from the screaming has no dialogue, or the scene where he finds heart under blade. I was afraid they'd get cut or shortened for time so yay!

The parts from the 2nd feel fast paced but I didn't mind too much. It was less clear that Dramaturgy was full vampire, Episode was half, and Guillotine Cuter was full human. I actually got those details from the wiki to be sure.  There wasn't as much build up to these fights, which could be a little odd for a new viewer. There is no conversation between Araragi and Hanekawa before he fights Dramaturgy. So the first time she sees him after their meeting scenes are when she is shocked to see him fighting Dramaturgy. 

The third part felt pretty similar too. The only clear part I noticed missing was the breast fondling scene... The gym scene was there so you still have that conversation between them and her telling him not to die, but it stops there.

Which brings me to the fan service-y scenes which make up most of the cut content. It makes sense, but is a little sad cause even though they are kinda ridiculous they're pretty funny too, and have narrative meaning. So yeah THAT part of the gym scene is cut, Hanekawa doesn't give Araragi her underwear, and the scene with Hanekawa checking out shirtless Araragi & the exposition about being a vampire putting his body into better shape are all gone.

This is definitely not a conclusive list it's just what I remember the day after watching. But yeah overall I thought it was really great, engaging throughout, and worth it to see on the big screen.",True,manga,1705365996.0,197pb0f
