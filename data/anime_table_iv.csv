So I've been trying to find an anime that I watched way back, but my memory is hazy around the details. So this is a total hail mary.

The show is not newer than 2003 and probably not older than 98'-99'. It's an absurdist comedy with a team of girls who has pretty much useless powers. One of the powers is, how I remember it, Earth Falldown. She just falls over. 

They do battle against either monsters or aliens and one of the antagonists rise up from the ocean. I also remember wooden poles stuck in the sand at the beach when they do battle.

I'm turning 30 this year and when I was younger I watched a lot more animes than I do now. I liked “old” animes like OG Dragonball, Inuyasha, Cowboy Bebop, and Neon Genesis Evangelion. When I got together with my wife, I got her into anime and we watched Naruto, Sword Art Online and Attack on Titan together. Nowadays, she watches more anime than I do and everytime, she asks me to join her but I can't enjoy for some reason ""newer"" animes like Jujutsu Kaisen or Demon Slayer (her favourites). It feels like I have lost something on the way.. I don't know why but I think it's the newer artstyle of these animes. They look so clean and flawless in contrast to the ""good old, hand drawn"" animes. However, I wanna do my wife a favour and watch a show with her together. Which Animes would you recommend to a person like me? Is Jujutsu Kaisen worth it maybe? Or is there something I might enjoy more? Thank you all very kindly.

Then the main character somehow ends up on an island where he befriends a little girl, and he realizes something is wrong with how the island is ran. Something he finds weird is that there are no animal noises on the island, and no pets anywhere.

My journey in Anime so far,What to Watch?,"So far I have watched anime series like Demon Slayer, Romantic Killer, My happy marriage, Chainsaw Man, Naruto and movies Spirited Away, Howls moving castle, Arietty, Ponyo, basically all the Studio Ghibli ones.

I fell in love with Demon Slayer. The characters and the story line were very interesting. Each fight interesting techniques and each Demon backstop was very moving. The other series that I loved was Romantic Killer. I was hooked right from episode 1. Other than these 2 anime series, I couldn't find other series that are as interesting.

No offense to any fans, but Chainsaw Man was bad. There were no techniques or anything interesting in the fights. There was nothing particularly moving, and no character was worth remembering IMHO. I started Jujutsu Kaisen and I was basically forcing myself to get through till the 9th episode. Again, the fights weren't interesting, no scene in all the 9 episdes kept me to the edge of my seat.

Love is war is another anime that is supposed to be really great. But man, it was too cringe and bad that I couldn't make it past the 2nd episode.

Is it just me or are there others who also feel the same way? I really got into anime after Demon Slayer. I kept searching for other acclaimed anime to watch but I keep getting disappointed on watching them. 

So far the only anime I have LOVED is Demon slayer, Romantic killer. And all the Studio Ghibli movies <3

Anime recommendations for someone in need,What to Watch?,"Hi, I'm looking for a new anime to watch and I have this vibe I'm looking for but I have no idea what I'm looking for. I'm interested in watching an anime that's a little grungy, medium pace that has a bit of a plot to it and not very slice of life but a little soft like one but a little bit of something extra that happens in the universe. Maybe a little bit artsy in a way, more mature in nature but not a lot of fan service and not isekai. kinda thinking along the lines of something similar to Air gear, Bleach, Durarara!!, Blast of the tempest, Bungo Stray Dogs, Tokyo Goul, Blood Blockade, Noragami, The Unlimited Hyobu Kyosuke, Beelzebub and Gangsta. I have no idea if any of those anime fit into the vague vibe, I described or anything in common but I would appreciate it if anyone could help. Thank you",False,anime,1706716710.0,1afl3r6
Any one else notice this common issue with anime?,Discussion,"I started watching Inuyasha for the first time and was surprised how solid the world building was. After thinking about it it was less that inuyasha had a great setting and more that many anime tend to completely forget about the setting.

I don't know if some one else has a better name for this but i call it ""in a bottle syndrome"". Over time the story of many anime feel more and more like they are in a bottle and not at all part of a bigger setting.

Examples would include when the heros fight the villian for a long time and the rest of the world seems to dissappear until they are done, stories set in modern times where people forget police and hospitals exist until its dramatically convient, or most common of all when you get long running anime were there are almost no extras, as of the important characters all exist in a pocket dimension with other important characters and no one else.

I consider this a problem but its not a deal breaker, there are plenty of shows I have enjoyed that suffer from this.

I don't like or watch anime but I am starting to find anime girls very attractive. is this weird/common? Am I turning into a neckbeard?,Help,"I am not into anime but my younger brother always watches it. I went to a anime convention with him last year on november. it was the anime con in NYC at javits center and it was his (and mine) first convention. I saw a lot of merchandise and stuff about half naked and lewd anime characters.

  
he downloaded and watches services like ""crunchyroll"" on his ps5 and when Im in the room as him I also end up hearing and watching the shows a bit.

I never really found cartoons that attractive, I watched things like animated superhero shows with characters like starfire and wonderwoman and I did think they hot but nothing like what I am feeling with anime?

Like the way these ""anime"" characters are drawn somehow entices me? Like their eyes and even hair?  
and its not just their appearance but its also their personalities and voices that somehow entices me?  
out of curiosity I started searching up ""ecchi"" and I found characters like ""rias gremory"" to really captivate me? like the way her body is shaped and detailed, her hair, her eyes, and the way she talks and act really entices me?

sorry about the long body text but I just feel kind of shocked and embarrassed about it. I never felt this way about other animated characters like ""jessica rabbit"" or daphne from scooby doo or any other ""hot"" animated character.  
theres something more charming and attractive about anime girls.  
Like am I turning to a neckbeard?

EDIT: also Why are anime girls so much hotter than other animated characters? Like I never felt this way towards ""jessica rabbit"" or any disney princesses or any video game characters like daisy and princess peach from mario.",False,anime,1706715528.0,1afknlh
Looking for suggestions of a deep/extensive storyline,What to Watch?,"I'm really craving a specific type of anime and struggling to scratch the itch.  Looking for something in the vein of FMA/brotherhood and 7 Samurai or Ghost in the shell.

Shonen or Seinen is cool so long as there is a complex storyline with pay off and a lot of purpose.  Character development is really important too. 

I'd like something dark and brooding but small comedy elements are welcome as long as they're minimal.  

Not to be too specific but either a realistic outdoor setting or a dystopian metropolis setting would be best.  More on the drama/horror/sci fi side than the fantasy side but I'm open to suggestions.  

Looking forward to hearing what you suggest.",False,anime,1706714499.0,1afk9kh

Send me an anime that changed how you think,What to Watch?," I want to fall in love with watching anime again. I'm looking for anime recommendations that stuck with you, ones that you watched five or ten years ago and still think about to this day, or even ones you watched recently that just blew you away in a way you're sure you won't soon forget.

Desperately Looking for Anime Recommendations,What to Watch?,"Hey Anime Family! I was hoping some of you could help me out here, I'm a huge anime lover just like all of you, my tastes range from Isekai, Romantic Comedy, Slice Of Life, Heart Warming, Feel Good, Adventure, Reverse Isekai, Shonen, Harem, Parody and many others but I think those are the biggest for me. The thing is in my real life I suffer from chronic anxiety and depression and in that regard Anime is like a double edged sword to me. When I find a good anime that I enjoy it genuinely helps me, I'm the kind of person who feels everything our favorite protagonists feel when they feel it. 

Whether that be happiness, sadness, anger, world ending terror and everything in between, I'm going through it with them and I enjoy that while I'm watching it because it genuinely distracts me from how depressed I am in my own life I should add that I prefer to stay away from depressing themed animes that have too much suffering or sadness in them, I can deal with some, but for one instance, I'm torn on Re:Zero Starting Life In Another World. The reason why is because the characters, the story, the world building is AMAZING and its one of my favorite animes hands down. However, the depressing apsects if it are genuinely bad for my mental health, it makes me so unbelievably depressed that at times I wish I never got invested in it because now it's too late and I have to suffer as they suffer because I love them. 

Another thing I'd like to add is that it KILLS me when an anime I get into gets canceled or rather in the anime world the forever unknown because they never actually cancel it, we just never hear anything else about it andnwe go on forever hoping it'll get picked up for another season even though most likely it won't, apart from some rare cases like ""The Devil Is A Part Timer!"" Man I was so happy when that got a new 2 cour season even though it was soo many years later. When the anime is left unfinished it breaks my heart and it never leaves my mind which nowadays just seems like the norm unfortunately because as we all know Animes are just a way to get more people to buy the light novel and / or manga. 

So all of that being said (and I'm really sorry this post got away from me and got so long) I'm looking for recommendations for some great anime that are already completed (not canceled) and had a proper ending or its close to being completed (last season coming soon, or so insanely popular there's no way it won't air to completion). SOME of the many animes I've seen and loved (and yes I know some of these haven't finished airing and might not finish and it breaks me, sometimes when I run out of anime to watch I get anxious and have to pick one that's still ongoing, unfortunately for me)

If you guys can help me out with some recommendations based on this list and even if it's something different, if you think it's a good anime, and it has a proper conclusion, the anime finished without being canceled, please throw it my way! I really do appreciate your help everyone thank you so much and I realize this is a long post and goes into a few different issues I have personally so I would really appreciate it if nobody would pick on me for that. Thanks again everyone!

- Isekai

- Slice Of Life
- Feel Good
- Heart Warming
- Adventure 
- Reverse Isekai

- Harem

That's the main thing I remember, this robot could turn it's arm up and bring some guns from it's elbows... Also I kinda remember it had only one red eye and one companion... But this part is kinda blurry.

Gundam Witch From Mercury S1 Episode 8 thoughts,Discussion,"Ik this aired like a year ago, but I was just watching it for the first time when I got this horrendous realization, and I needed to talk about it. Suletta isn't just a pseudonym for Eri so they could avoid the council. Suletta is a new daughter, or maybe a clone of some sort like Erlan was, and Eri was made into Ariel. It just makes too much sense. Eri was 4 years old in the prologue, and Suletta is 17 now, but they say the Vanadis incident was over 20 years ago. It makes no sense unless Suletta was born after Eri was. 

And look how hard Suletta & her mom are pushing the fact that Ariel is family to them. Suletta probably doesn't know it yet, but was taught to think of Ariel as a sister because the Mom wanted them to still have a connection. Also, think about what they said a Gundam was. It's the fusion between man and machine. What better way to fuse them than to literally combine them into one? That's why there's no burden on the pilot of Ariel when they do the Permet thing. The Gundam itself is taking on the burden so the pilot doesn't have to. And remember how Suletta's mom said that they definitely couldn't mass-produce Ariels? It's because it requires the sacrifice of someone with a very strong affinity for the Gundam.

Last and final point, look at the fucking names. Ariel? Eri? Coincidence? I think not.",False,anime,1706689645.0,1afd6e7

I need help finding a scene from One Piece!,Help,"So when I was younger, I remember watching one piece in my family living room on Nickelodeon and the scene has stuck with me for so many years and that memory has even re-ignited my love of one piece later on in life.

The memory itself is very vague but it begins halfway through a fight scene between Luffy and an enemy I can’t remember. They’re in some ruins underground and they’re surrounded by sand and the heat underground becoming so hot that Luffy starts to sweat uncontrollably and his arms start to stretch and become almost like noodle. He starts spinning and spinning until his arms fully wrap around his body and that’s where my memory stops.

This was from when I was very young and I’m now 27 so forgive me if I have very little to go on. I thought it might be a fight between Luffy and Crocodile but after rewatching the series, None of it matches my memory. Perhaps it was one of the One Piece movies or something?

Looking for anime where the Protag gives up like Dreaming Boy is a Realist,What to Watch?,"I've been watching Dreaming Boy is a Realist and really enjoyed it. Giving up on your long held hopes and kinda moving on with life a day at a time is a whole mood I synch with. And I like how most of the characters are provoked into the plot of the series not by anyone doing anything, but by the effect of seeing this one guy they thought they knew.... not doing anything wierd or over the top for a change.

I think I'd like to watch something else with a similar premise.... but I don't know not if it's too cynical like that anime with the children's show host who sings and tells children things that are way too cynical adult hot takes with a fake smile on his face. I want to watch stuff that feels kind of fun and witty like Dreaming Boy is a Realist, but also feels like it has that quiet slightly sad but also liberating acceptance that comes from giving up on something impractical.

My take on the Japanese Anime Localisation Controversy.,Discussion,"（ちょっとしたタイプミスを直した）  
  
I watch anime in both Japanese and English, and I can tell you how shockingly different the shit is.

Yes, translations cannot be 1:1, but these localizers used that as an excuse to justify disproportionate translations of 1 million : 1, by inserting certain quips and slang that removes all context of cultural relativism and the original consciousness of the Japanese material, and those quips and slangs are from the perspective of mainly US/UK audiences, while totally ignoring the fact that other countries SPEAK ENGLISH too.

To be fair, allow me to also bring up bad localisations from the Japanese side with American material, such as the Last of Us video game. In the original English scene when Joel responded with ""Like hell you do"" in response to Tess's remarks about how she knew where the goods are, the Japanese version of this has been localised to　 ""ほんとか？どこだ？"" - which translates to ""Really? Where?"". While this somewhat fits the scene without breaking any narrative of the game, it completely removes the consciousness of the original Joel's character and the remark ""Like hell you do"" was supposed to be a form of sarcasm of sorts, a display of disbelieve while at the same time could very well be expecting the other person to spill the rest of the beans.

With this in mind, Japanese anime fans wanted the same thing, that is:

Do your very best to not remove the Japanese consciousness that exists within a material by trying to ""improve the line"" or ""make sense to the target audience"". Your target audience is the whole, fucking globe of the world, with many other countries speaking universal English that many do not even understand certain slang and quips such as ""mid"". Your attempt to make it more ""gyaru"" merely makes the character likely to be more ""californian"", and that removes the consciousness of the part of the gyaru that is still Japanese.

To bring things into better perspective, imagine every single catchphrase in every single English movie and media being localised into Japanese where the familiar humour is gone, many Japanese localisations do not do a great work to capture the same American consciousness from American movies, for example. Similarly, do not bring in American humour into Japanese material where such zany, verbose expressions of humour do not exists in the general Japanese consciousness where sarcasm is usually involved. Japanese have sarcasm, but it is normally not used to express comedy similarly like the ones you hear in America.

Speaking to you as a person who watches anime in both languages, and the English ones are really bad to bring in ""patriarchy"" where the material has none, or how ""tsundere"" is localised as a ""fragile male ego"" by moralising how a person must be going on in their heads in moments of ""tsundereness"", when in fact ""tsundere"" is merely used as a pop-culture identifier, not as an actual pop-psychology method to actually tell if their egos, male or female otherwise, are indeed fragile or not.

You can in fact, in reality, have a stable ego while still being tsun, so the dogma of localisers patting themselves on the back of this is truly ignorant and disgusting, especially when you learn that some of these localisers don't even speak Japanese, which makes me wonder if they even understood the material CULTURALLY and SUB-CONSCIOUSLY to even think it is not the form of the audacity of the highest order to think you could localise Japanese material by ""making it American"" with reasons such as ""the English have better flow"" or the English one has better humour"", all without realising that you are judging them within the eyes of your own American lenses of what the ""better"" here even is, completely disregarding the Japanese consciousness, and worse, completely disregarding the REST OF THE CIVILISED WORLD who also speaks English, but do not actually speak nor understand any of the quips and sense of American humour.",False,anime,1706666834.0,1af6cce

Might be a long shot but does anyone recognize a scene I remember? It was on tv about 8 years ago,Help,"I only have one memory from a show that I saw one episode of years ago and it's been bugging me all this time. I think it was a city at night and someone was fighting something huge / powerful but I don't know if it was very visible? I don't really remember what it was. Something big and round in the sky maybe?   
The person fighting might have been magical, it's a bit fuzzy. One of the main pieces I remember was a train being launched at the bad thing. I don't think it worked, it might have thrown it back. 

The whole scene might have been a vision, or time travel? I remember it being quite depressing and dark, most of the city was destroyed by the end. I had a look around and Madoka Magica looked promising but I couldn't find anything after looking at some synopses . I haven't actually seen it though, so maybe I just missed it.

It was probably on Australian tv, ABC 3 specifically, 8-10 years ago. I don't think I would have seen it anywhere else.

Hard to believe how distant the age of anime fansubs feels,Discussion,"Just wanted to express myself as I can recall like it was yesterday when WAY back in the mid aughts, I had attempted to see what anime itself was like outside of Adult Swim shows such as Inuyasha and Bleach, and the results were very fascinating.




Like in the mid 00s, I had discovered all kinds of anime going from Shakugan no Shana, Kamisama Kazoku, and Dokuro Chan through the power of fansubs as finding anime legally didn’t really seem to exist back in those times.




I mean hey don’t get me wrong as I am very grateful that sites like Crunchyroll and HIDIVE exist, but it’s just that WAY long ago, those kind of sites didn’t exist, but technically Crunchyroll did, but I didn’t know about it, and I always heard how it was a fansub based site from its early days.",False,anime,1706653650.0,1af1dm4

What anime deserves the respect it needs and has been swept under the radar for years ?,What to Watch?,"Trying to build a solid list of anime to check out when I’m off from work. Would love to hear some of your recommendations.

Mobile Suit Gundam SEED MSV Astray: The introduction of the most bought gunpla kits,Discussion,"MSVs (Mobile Suit Variations) always get the short end of the stick when it comes to recognition. They might get lucky and get a handful of model kits or at most appear as a cameo in a build anime. Hence why I always found it ironic that both the Astray Red Frame & Blue Frame are as popular as they are, since they only appear in these shorts. These 2 episodes are 5 minute shorts that expand on the universe of the Cosmic Era. Anime with a short run time always get over hated since they're really quick. That's what a lot about say about Gundam Breaker Battlouge (even though I thought it was a fun little series). So are these 2 worth watching or not?

* Plot: 
   * Both episodes have a vastly different plot from one another. There's not a whole lot I can say, and explain these in like 2 minutes. In Red Frame; The Junk Guild goes to Earth to an auction to buy parts for their Astray Red Frame. However, they're forced to fight after encountering a couple ZAFT soldiers. As for Blue Frame; While a fight with the Earth Alliance is happening outside, The Serpent Tail are trying to capture a GINN in an abandoned space base. 
   * These 2 episodes aren't really anything special narrativily speaking, as they're by the books and are focused on quick Mecha action. And for 2 episodes with 5 minutes of runtime, can they really do anything more? Overall nothing special to call it good or bad writing.
* Characters: 
   * The short runtime also affects the writing of the characters, as they don't have much to work with. They're not necessarily bad, but they're not necessarily “memorable”. I can easily define them in one personality trait. In the Junk Guild; Kisato is the little sister of the group (and luckily the less annoying kind), Liam is the weirdo, and the Professor is the sex figure with glasses. Not much of a diverse group. 
   * The only one with actual personality is definitely Lowe Gule. He's carefree & easygoing, making him a pretty likable guy. I also do like that the no kill rule applies for him because he's pretty trusting towards others. So ya, Klein is the best guy in the group (I guarantee one of you will understand that reference). As for the Serpent Tail; I can really say too much since they all feel like the same character. There's barely any differing traits that separates them from one another outside of their looks. So overall, Lowe is basically the only one of these characters that's worth talking about.
* World building: 
   * Okay, now let's talk about the best part about these episodes (or mainly Red Frame), the world building. The way they expanded upon the Cosmic Era is great and it shows its unique traits. Auctions are like car shows, but for mobile suits, the Junk Guild are basically a maintenance & Salvaging team, and the Serpent Tail are a mercenary group that'll take on any job. This adds more intrigue into the lore of the Cosmic Era & gives it more personality. 
   * My only gripe is how they never explained how currency even works here. When Lowe bought a BuGUE's head, he spent a million “Earth Dollars”. Makes me wonder if this is the universal currency on earth or there's other types of currency. Now that I think about it, currency is never really explained in the franchise. They never explained that part in any of the entries and just wrote it off as “Colony/Earth Dollars”. Props to After War Gundam X for at least trying to show us how their currency exchange works. Overall, I think the world building was done pretty well here.
* Mobile Suits: 
   * With SEED having such an expansive roaster of mobile suits, this OVA still has a fair amount of those. While smaller, it still has both familiar faces along with some redesigns. But let's get this out of the way, both the Strike Dagger, CGUE, & GuAIZ reappear in this OVA. But they merely serve as cannon fodder. 
   * But we're here for the main attraction, the Astray Red Frame & Blue Frame. Starting with the Red Frame, it always found its popularity kinda ironic since this is its only appearance in any form of animation in SEED. Even its loadout is pretty different from what we usually see. In the OVA, it just has a flight pack, a BuCUE’s head with dual beam sabers & its Gerbera Straight Katana. In lore, it also uses the standard stuff (head vulcans, a shield, a pair of vulcans, and a beam rifle). And yet the master grades always has it with 3 medium gun swords or a bigger sword to make Guts piss his pants. But that last part was for our next Astray, the Blue Frame Second L. Same standard loadout of the original, but in the OVA, it uses said giant sword, the Tactical Arms. This thing can serve as a flight pack, a Gatling gun turret, & you guys guessed it, a big ass sword. Both Frames are pretty good, as they have their own style to them. 
   * As for the other units, It was nice to see different variations of mobile suits we know. The CGUE DEEP Arms was an interesting take on the regular CGUE with its thermal energy cannon & Heavy laser sword. Its also a nice attention to detail to see the cannon have real heat problems, and its nice that it’s actually addressed. We also see the GINN High Maneuver type, but it doesn’t have much outside of just stealing those GN Drives from 00 (Which is weird to say since this came out 1st). The BuCUE Tactical Reconnaissance Type does appear too, but as I mentioned earlier, its head is just used as a double beam saber for the Astray. There’s also Eijiah’s GINN that doesn’t do a damn thing in the anime. And finally we have the Sword Calamity, which just replaces the original Calamity’s back cannons with dual swords. It’s definitely a cool looking machine and probably is a fully capable machine, and it appears only once and never again. Welp, if you want to experience this Gundam in all of its glory, dust off that PS Vita & play the SEED Battle Destiny. I
   * ts nice to see these MSV get the animated spotlight for a change and see them in their full glory. We need more MSVs in anime since not a whole lot of people really know about these designs. And it's such a shame too, since some of them have some really interesting backstories of either being attempted mass-produced versions of existing mobile suits or armored up/upgraded or tuned versions of some. The closest you’ll get is getting to play as these suits in some of the games or even a whole kit with reused parts, if your lucky.
* Verdict: 
   * I haven’t written a review this short since Twilight Axis. But unlike that trainwreck of an OVA, MSV Astray does a better job with what it's given. It may not be much in terms of story or even characters. But it does expand on the Cosmic Era a little and adds some really good designs. At the very least it’s worth watching for the mecha action. All I can say, is that this OVA is the calm before the storm. And oh boy, a storm is coming for the Cosmic Era.",False,anime,1706651927.0,1af0o0g

Frieren is turning into a cultural phenomenon in Japan,Discussion,"Frieren's has been a monster on the r/anime weekly engagement rankings and a popular topic of discussions, but I'm not sure fans of the series outside of Japan realize just how much of a cultural phenomenon Frieren's become IN Japan.

First off, the sales of the Freiren manga has jumped into a different stratosphere since the start of the anime.   The manga was already a big hit with 10M volumes sold before the anime started, from April 2020 \~ Sept. 2023. 10M sold is a large enough number [that some manga websites in Japan](https://manba.co.jp/keyword_tags/1906) use it as a benchmark for what's considered a ""hit"" manga you can filter for.

Over the course of 3.5 years, 10M volumes sold.  But that was before the anime.

In just 2 months after the anime started, the manga sold SEVEN MILLION more copies during Nov/Dec 2023.

[https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2023-12-04/frieren-manga-adds-7-million-copies-to-circulation-in-2-months-since-anime-premiere/.205063](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2023-12-04/frieren-manga-adds-7-million-copies-to-circulation-in-2-months-since-anime-premiere/.205063)

Even at over 3M copies per month being sold, Frieren is a long way away from cracking the top 20 list of [best selling manga of all time](https://www.cbr.com/best-selling-manga-how-many-copies/#naruto-masashi-kishimoto), but the anime is launching the manga into the rarified sales pace of smash hit manga that every Japanese person can easily recognize.

Moreover, Frieren's cultural influence in Japan is jumping into the mainstream.

The phrase 勇者ヒンメルならそうした (The Hero Himmel would have done so) is [a manga/anime meme](https://togetter.com/li/2246854?page=2) that's made the jump into Japanese mainstream culture. It's gotten the name ヒンメル理論 (Himmel logic) where you point out the right/noble thing to do saying this is what Himmel would have done.

A parent [shared a funny story](https://togetter.com/li/2246854?page=2) where their elementary school child didn't want to do their homework and in exasperation, he said ""This is what Himmel would have done"" and the kid was like ""That's true"" and did it. There are multiple groups on social media [devoted to the meme](https://yuusha-hinmeru-nara.quora.com/).  A search for[ヒンメルなら (Himmel would have)](https://twitter.com/search?q=%E3%83%92%E3%83%B3%E3%83%A1%E3%83%AB%E3%81%AA%E3%82%89&src=typed_query&f=top) on twitter (X) pulls up thousands of tweets with people's twists on the phrase.

Frieren's being pulled into crossover advertising campaigns.  Japanese fans were amused when a crossover collaboration between Frieren and Beyblade (a line of spinning top toys popular with younger kids) was announced.

[https://togetter.com/li/2246187](https://togetter.com/li/2246187)

The logic of Frieren ""discovering"" Beyblades was Frieren wanted to learn more about humans... then learned that humans like playing with Beyblades (which cracked up Japanese fans leading to jokes about Frieren discovering just about anything)

It just feels like Frieren is definitely hitting another gear in terms of public consciousness in Japan.  It was already well known among manga fans after it won the reader-voted [Manga Taisho award in 2021](https://www.mangataisho.com/archives/2021.html) over strong contenders like ""Chi"" and ""Oshi no ko"" and ""Monster No. 8,"" but it feels like Frieren is on the trajectory to become something bigger.",False,anime,1706650678.0,1af058d

Who would have thought (Shield Hero Post),Discussion,"I know that this subreddit does not like Shield Hero and that's fine if you don't like it. But as a SH fan myself, I was surprised that a 4th season was announced considering that the popularity of SH has decreased after the disastrous 2nd season from 2 years ago. Yet still, after all the criticisms and hate, it somehow got a 4th season after a improved but ok 3rd season (however, as a LN reader, I was glad that it's much closer to the source material than the first 2 seasons combined). Also, seeing that the Blu Ray sales were pretty low (I think around 500) and the fact that I think the West mostly hates it but it fascinates me on how popular it is with other places outside of Japan.

If there are any SH LN readers in the subreddit, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the announcement and how much they're going to adapt. I hope Kadokawa learns their lesson from the 2nd season that if they want to adapt more volumes, they need more episodes. ",False,anime,1706633276.0,1aesxna
Do you enjoy or dislike realism in anime and why?,Discussion,"I'll preface this by saying this is referring to slice-of-life/romance anime. I had a conversation with someone about how the realism of a specific romance anime I watched felt insanely bland to them and made it boring and seem like it had no driving plot or conflict. I, on the other hand, argued that the realism is what made it such a fulfilling slow burn and provides a sense of grounded comfort. I'm obviously avoiding naming the specific anime to avoid bias.

I personally believe that it really does come down to taste and what you're in the mood for at the moment. There are days where I want to watch something more quirky that is driven by silly tropes for the sake of entertainment, while there are other days that I want to feel more enamored by a plot that isn't over the top or largely glamorous. 

What is your take on realism in SOL/romance? Do you feel that anime should avoid it as this form of media should serve as an escape from reality, or do you think that realism should be embraced to push the plot forward as long as it doesn't sacrifice development?",False,anime,1706633030.0,1aesu09

"Which anime that isn't in the ""slice of life"" genre do you think does SOL scenes best?",Discussion,"I'm of the opinion that a show, no matter the genre, lives or dies by its main cast's ability to keep the momentum going even when nothing momentous is happening. For some shows, this just keeps going until they end, putting them squarely in the slice of life genre. But I always appreciate when a show that has a ton going on plot-wise takes some time to let its world and the characters breathe, and the shows that manage to be just as entertaining in these moments tend to become my favorites.

For instance, *The Apothecary Diaries* instantly drew me in last season due to how much I absolutely adore Maomao and her interactions with the rest of the rear palace. Despite how much I vibe with the murder mysteries, I honestly think I enjoy the non-dramatic scenes with Maomao and company even more now (the fact that Aoi Yuuki's range is completely insane doesn't hurt). And judging by the preview for this week's episode, it looks like it'll have more of Maomao and Jinshi just living their lives, so I can't wait!",False,anime,1706631282.0,1aes3va

I need my fill of wow,What to Watch?,"U kno kurokos basketball, Ahiru no Sora? In both Animes the mc is insanely talented and stuff. 

I NEED MORE

I want to find a sports anime where the mc is already at pro level, like yeah they can struggle but never ever get beat. And if they do then it’s not their fault, it’s the teams fault. 
Anyway, they gotta be at pro lvl but get underestimated all the time cos of their height, figure, personality etc. They’re new to town and whatnot and show everyone what they can do and lead the team to VICTORY. 

Anyway, reference of what I loved like this: 
Sk8 the infinity
That’s it. I basically need another panga but in another sport.
And sport anime I’ve watched:
Haikyuu
Blue lock
Kurokos basketball
Ahiru no sora
Backflip 
Sk8 the infinity 
Stride
That one running anime
And sport anime I’m scared of watching cos of art style or age:
One outs 
Initial d. 
(I don’t spesifically judge on age, just older anime’s have that cringe hair thing. And I’ve been spoiled by mappa for animation.)

I don’t rly care how good the story is. I just need a bunch of arrogant little shts to kneel down to a kid they underestimated.

I forgot an anime movie that I had watched,Help,"Long ago I watched an anime movie that I really liked. If possible could someone help me find what it was?

I watched it before 2018.

I remember it being about a girl going back to her home in the countryside(not too sure). She used to live there when she was young. At that time she was friends with the spirits that inhabited the area. Now she is older she doesn’t think the spirits are real and doesn’t really want to go back.

Two scenes I remember :
1 - she is in the car during the start of the movie as she looks out the window she notices weird spirits flying in the sky. Suddenly something happens witch hides the spirits for a few seconds. After that they weren’t there anymore.

2 - a flashback about her as a baby/child climbing up a big tree with multiple spirits cheering her on. As her parents calls for her the spirits gradually disappear. Once her parents find her they talk about how it was impossible for her to be able to get up onto that tree.


I would say that this anime would be categorized as :
-coming of age
-wholesome

What anime have the most creative titles?,Discussion,"I'm a huge proponent of the idea that a good title can make or break a work or offer some kind of clever insight into the work itself. It's a subtle thing, but I like songs and other pieces with titles that aren't so direct as just copying a lyric or describing the piece and make you think a little. Like a good poster, a good title can also prime our expectations of a work going in.

And to be honest, I think most anime kind of suck at this. I know the whole overly long and descriptive light novel title bit is getting old at this point, but even leaving those aside, the title game isn't great. Not to say that it necessarily distracts from a piece, but a lot of the remaining titles either references the main character (*Frieren, Naruto, Lupin, Baki*, etc.), another major character or entity in the world (*Mobile Suit Gundam, Akira, Pluto, Shiki, Gurren Lagann, etc.*) or a basic part of the world or story (*Amagi Brilliant Park, Hyouka, Land of the Lustrous, Vinland Saga, One Piece, Maison Ikkoku*, etc.). These are fine, but I want to know what titles get really creative.

So what are some titles that really hit you with that ""aha moment"" where it starts to make sense or that make you think ""that's pretty clever""?

Some examples that come to mind are this season's *A Sign of Affection* (a cheeky reference to the MC's hearing condition), *Deca-Dence* (technically another noun title, but one that grows a deeper meeting after some first episode spoiler-y shenanigans), *March Comes in Like a Lion* (a reference to the show's themes of depression and how it too shall pass), *Anohana* (a lot to unpack here, I recommend just looking it up) or more spoiler heavy titles that are the embodiment of the ""those who know vs. those who don't know"" meme like *Girls' Last Tour* and *Your Lie in April*. Special shout out to *Yurikuma Arashi* which literally translates to ""Lesbian Bear Storm"" which is kinda on point.",False,anime,1706627569.0,1aeqnkd

Help me find this Anime,Help,I don’t have a picture so I will try to explain as much as I know about that show. It was an episodic Children’s Anime. The main character was a boy living in a neighborhood. The whole premise of the show was that he had a imaginary friend???? It was like a big fluffy and stupid bunny. He had magic abilities. To be honest I don’t really know if he was imaginary. Besides those 2 there were of course other returning characters living in the neighborhood. I don’t remember anyone besides 2 little girls that were twins. Those 2 annoyed the main character if I am not mistaking. Luckily I can remember one episode. That bunny guy traveled thru the human body for some reason and ended up in the head and he traveled with an elevator only to see a lot of ear wax. One thing I know is that it was like around 2015. I saw it on Disney XD but I don’t know if it was in Germany or in Kosovo when I was visiting my family.

there's one part i rmebebr, but i still can't remember it well. i think it was a doctor who drugs one of the girls and tried to r*pe her but she's not acc drugged and she stabs him in the eyes

i can also remember that, at some point the criminals are let loose. accident? or they were trying to escape so now it’s kinda a game of who catches who first. 

i don't know i don't know how it happened tell me what the fuck it is i'm spiralling

sorry i'm not making sense but if i don't rmebebr thsi then i’m about to write the next hit BUT IT IS REAL I SWEAR  ",False,anime,1706600486.0,1aej06u

Insomniacs After School - Romance doesn't always have to be grand,Discussion,"I just finished watching Insomniacs After School. It would be hard not to sound like a broken record among the other fans who loved the show, but given how much of a hold it had on me, I wanted to get my thoughts out on it and discuss more!

&#x200B;

TLDR: Insomniacs After School feels like the pinnacle of realistic, slow burn, long game romance that is not only adorable to watch unfold, but feels relatable every step of the way.

&#x200B;

As someone who suffers from occasional insomnia (funnily enough turning to romance/romcom anime to kill the time before eventually dozing off), this show couldn't have come at a better time. Immediately from episode 1, Ganta Nakami presents himself as an extremely relatable main character without giving off the cringe ""I hate my life"" or ""I need to be better than everyone else"" spiel. Rather, he is an outwardly off-putting and deeply misunderstood person who can't help but project his previous trauma through his lackadaisical attitude due to his insomnia. Ganta seemingly presents himself to the audience as a somewhat dislikable character for lack of depth that quickly gets answered with a reason to be intrigued by his demeanor.  


Isaki Magari, on the other hand, is seemingly a polar opposite; loud and bubbly in nature, clearly very popular with the rest of her class without having to rely on any type of ""gyaru"" tropes but is genuinely someone that you just can't seem to dislike as she gives no reason to, even if you were to try. Her extroverted nature clashes with Ganta's personality very clearly, which isn't anything new in the world of anime, we see this trope all the time. Two main characters who are seemingly polar opposites but eventually form a deep connection and fall for each other? You might as well be writing the plot to, like, 85% of romance anime out there.

&#x200B;

However, what brings them together is what truly makes their connection unique and weighted with depth. Insomnia is already relatable for a majority of people who watch anime as I'm sure we've all had those sleepless night that we just can't put down a show to continue to watch another episode. But what's so great about insomnia being their ""red string"" here is that it is a constant, realistic reason for these two characters to grow closer to one another. By feeling so helpless in your insomnia, it is no wonder that you naturally grow closer to someone who suffers from the same affliction, knowing that you aren't alone while everyone else around you disappears into their sleep.

&#x200B;

Everything about this show, from its plot to the activities, and even to the conversations had between Ganta and Isaki, can be traced back to their shared insomnia in a way that never falters, there is no reason to believe all of this as just ""anime"" reasoning considering 1 in 3 adults suffer from insomnia symptoms, making this one of the most relatable and realistic main themes that I've seen in an anime. Who wouldn't want to spend those unsleepable hours in the dead of night with someone by their side? It's almost as if you two would be the only ones in the world as everyone around you disappears from the streets and establishments of the world to rest.  


The side characters, who rubbed me the wrong way at first as a flat attempt of adding some world-building, also contain their own depth without stealing the show or being to flashy in their integration.  The relationship between the entire group feels largely organic which is somewhat rare in most anime these days. Granted, what tied most of the group together is Isaki being the glue for most members, Ganta still plays a huge portion in a theme that can also stand to learn a lot from; treat others the way you want to be treated. By extending a hand to everyone he wants to recruit, they feel more than happy to return the favor which ultimately forms a nice group to watch on-screen, even if the reason they got together ended up not happening at the end of it all. What they got out of it was a friend group with a sturdy foundation. Even Motoko Kanikawa, who can arguably be described as the most dislikable character in her introduction, is organically integrated into the group by simply experiencing FOMO and wanting to be part of the fun and center of attention. It's not only in line with her character, but a clever way to add her into the story that feels realistic and natural, and of course we're glad to see that she develops by the end, even if she still has a small chip on her shoulder.

&#x200B;

Lastly, the relationship between Ganta and Isaki grows as naturally as they do. From the beginning to the end, Ganta seems almost unrecognizable in comparison to who he is in episode 13 and who he was in episode 1. What starts off as an avoidant character just looking for any excuse to find some sleep away from everyone else, we see a character who opens up not only to Isaki, but to everyone else in the group when he thought no such notion could be feasible. Isaki, on the other hand, seems to almost have given up on getting any better, despite her outwardly demeanor, to the point where she even hints to dying sometime in the future (thank God that didn't happen, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, mentally preparing). There was a particular scene where Ganta and Isaki are headed to the final photo site where Ganta grabs Isaki's hand as she's running in front of him, saying something along the lines of ""I feel like if I let her go, she'll melt away in this white-hot summer"". I guess to an extent, he was right. Isaki seemed to have hinted at eventually disappearing, but Ganta, with the growth he experienced over the course of the series, developed the strength and the courage to hold on to her, letting her know that she is seen for who she is and what she means to him. The climax of their relationship is probably one of the most natural, organic, and fulfilling confessions I have ever watched in anime. Nothing about it felt rushed, in fact at a certain point I found myself thinking ""Dude, just tell her already!"" but Isaki's insistence on waiting till they reach the finish line made the payload hit that much harder, truly tugging at the stiffest of heart strings.

&#x200B;

Overall, Insomniacs After School firmly cements itself in ""I can't believe I haven't watched this before"". Considering how much I love a wholesome slow burn and the occasional insomnia I suffer from myself, this show seemed right up my alley. However, even if that doesn't seem relatable to you, I couldn't recommend this more to anyone who wants something heartfelt to watch as the themes don't discriminate against those who aren't insomniacs, or night owls, or photographers, or astronomers, etc. There's much to pick up on life as a whole from this show, and I'm so glad I took the time to give it a thorough watch.

Anime like “Our Dating Story”,What to Watch?,"I just finished “Our Dating Story: Experienced You and the Inexperienced Me”. I binged 10 episode in one night and just finished the last two, and would love to keep watching, but unfortunately it is only one season. 

Does anyone have recommendations for anime that are similar to “Our Dating Story”?

I started with “Horimiya”, then “More Than a Married Couple, But Not Lovers”, and lastly “Our Dating Story”. 

I would prefer to watch an anime that has good animation and toned down fan service. I think “Our Dating Story” had very well done animation and the fan service was well balanced. When it was shown, the characters did not simply act like perverts, but instead chose to have a committed relationship. I am a few minutes into “My First Girlfriend is a Gal”, and the fan service is already over the top and I will likely stop watching.

“Our Dating Story” is definitely my favorite of the three romance anime that I have seen, and I would go as far as to say it is one of my favorite anime in general. I loved the characters and their devotion to each other as well as their desire to love each other before committing to the act.

Was this anime real or a figment of my imagination??? (Help),Help,"Okay so I was doing my hw just now and suddenly remembered this really old anime that I definitely recall having watched before but when I was LITTLE (like around 5-6) but when I tried searching for it I got no results...

&#x200B;

From what I can remember there's this young, brown haired poor/slave woman that gave birth to two red-haired twins (not ginger I mean actual red) and she was friends with this big cat (either sabertooth or regular lion idk) and not long after they were born he kidnapped the both of them and ran off as the woman chased behind, crying to not take her kids away. Either from guilt or some pain the big cat left only one of the twins behind and took the other to some evil lady.

Few years later the woman is working on some land, on the same land the kidnapped twin happens to be running around there and sees her before being escorted back by some creature thingy. After some time the woman dies and is put in a grave by the twin that was not kidnapped, I remember other kids his age having thrown stones at said grave and he chased them off.

&#x200B;

Next thing I remember is them being adults, the kidnapped twin goes through some ritual (I think) and is struck by lightning, and I believe he then saw who his real mother was (?) or something like that. Skippity skip- he reunites with his twin brother and they save this woman... the kidnapped twin falls in love with her and he and his brother get into an argument. 

&#x200B;

Now the LAST thing I can remember from this: was the kidnapped twin's lover giving birth to this ugly alien looking baby that did something to the world and brought down chaos to it all. And that's it. That's all I got.

Now I know Reddit is full of detectives so I need ya'll to help me figure this out or not, I'd really appreciate it because I can't stop wondering if I'm just delusional or nah-

What did Madoka do to earn Homura’s undying loyalty?,Discussion,"I’m one of the minority that found Puella Magi just good-ish, and not “best masterpiece 10/10” material in my opinion. 

I’m fairly sure the main focal point of the series is probably how you see the two leads. One of my main questions is what did Madoka do other than simply being friendly and kind with her that prompts Homura to devoting her whole life to this one girl she has known for a few days at most? 

She does save her once from a labyrinth, but that’s also just the duty of a magical girl in the first place. Madoka wasn’t alone either, she was with Mami. So it’s even less personal or intimate than if ONLY Madoka had gone out of her way to protect her. 

My suspension disbelief was broken just though this wild jump in Homura’s behavior. I think a few more episodes could have really helped explain their bond better. More time with showing their friendship growing stronger maybe, and seeing them connect in more than superficial ways. Basically, I think episode 10 felt rushed to a certain point. The backstory seems good on paper, but seeing it play out in story left much to be desired for me. It should work, but we BARELY get to see the stuff in the middle that actually builds their connection.

Looking back at the runtime of ep 10, there are about 6 total minutes between Homura meeting Madoka, and Homura crying over her corpse. Logistically, I should feel more for them  but the condensed and extremely fast pace of the episode makes it kind of hollow for me. I need more than a mere 6 minutes to explain a plot integral relationship to me for it to be believable.

Not a huge fan of sci fi but I'm not really that picky with the genres as long as it includes compelling characters and storylines. I also don't mind if it's long or short.

I'm a huge fan of comedies, dark comedies, psychological horror, dramas and thrillers, I also love romances (but obviously I don't mind if the recommendation doesn't include romance).

Need some recommendation on seinen animes,What to Watch?,"Hi people, I'm looking something to watch that is outside the shounen sub-genre. I watched Demon Slayer's last season recently, and it was getting on my nerves the fact that you know that the main protagonist or his friends aren't actually in danger, and despite villages and a lot of extras dying, it doesn't really feel like an impact. The main protagonist was always ""omg, I'm so weak"" * cries *, ""I need to protect my sister but I don't have the strength"" * takes strength out of his ass *, ""yay, I killed that bad guy after 5 episodes of me crying and internal dialogue on a technique that I can only use once, but I'll use it again because fuck you"" * monster gets a power up and the cycle repeats for another 5 episodes until the bad guy actually dies *. The bad guy had a rough backstory is a good thing, but it got to a point that's just ridiculous. EVERY ONI WOULD HAVE A TRAGIC BACKSTORY, it was beggining to feel like a punchline to a joke. It's not good anymore, when it gets to a point where you can literally tell what happens in the next episode, and so on. (Sorry for the rant, I know it's a convention on the shounen sub-genre, and the anime is a good shounen take).


I'm looking for animes like more like Paranoia Agent, Perfect Blue, Paprika, Welcome to the NHK, Serial Experiments Lain, Spy X Family (this one is surprisingly well written, while having a good story and character dynamics), Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop, Fullmetal Brotherhood (kinda shounen but things actually happen, matter, and progress in a good way), Fate/zero (this one I watched a long time ago, I remember it touched a few mature themes). 


TLDR: I know it's corny, but I'm looking for more ""deep"" animes, that touch on more complex themes, a more complex narrative and ""makes you think"" a bit more than ""yay, me kill bad guy"".

Which Japanese Artist has the strongest lineup of Anisongs to their credit?,Discussion,"Minimum I'd say for consideration are 5 songs across different anime

Just some that come to mind

LiSa

* Fate/Zero - Oath Sign
* Sword Art Online - Crossing Field
* Irregular at Magic High School - Rising Hope
* Nisekoi - Rally Go Round
* Demon Slayer - Gurenge

Yoasobi

* Oshi no Ko - Idol
* Frieren - Yuusha
* Gundam Witch From Mercury - Shukufuku
* Beastars - Kaibutsu
* Pokemon Scarlet and Violet - Biri Biri (technically not an anime but anime adjacent)

Man With a Mission

* Log Horizon - Database
* Seven Deadly Sins - Seven Deadly Sings
* Gundam Iron Blooded Orphans - Raise Your Flag
* Inuyashiki - My Hero
* Vinland Saga - Dark Crow

Edit: Glad to see this raised some good discussion! Some clarifying points 

* For me personally I'm looking for both breadth (ie has worked with multiple shows / franchises) and depth (has high quality bangers, bonus points if their songs have transcended their status as ""just"" and OP or ED.) If we were to compare it to sports, I couldn't really call a player a Hall of Fame player just because they have maybe 1-2 really good seasons under their belt, you want to see them having sustained production over a period of time. Likewise, a good ""workhorse"" player who doesn't make mistakes but also doesn't make big plays won't necessarily come to mind if you're asking about who the GOATs of the game are.
* An interesting point I hadn't considered - I was initially thinking mostly about performers (ie singers) but some people brought up composers (Yoko Kanno, Hiroyuki Sawano, Aki Hata) who maybe didn't sing or perform the songs themselves, but contributed to songs in general. I'll leave that up to you if you want to include them in this list, personally I think Composers and creating Soundtracks is a different skill than an OP/ED.
* While I initially asked who had the strongest lineup of Anisongs, one question that I've since been wondering - given that many prolific artists might have a legacy based on quantity (looking at you Mr 1200 songs Ichiro Mizuki), which artists would have the strongest 5 or 10 song lineups of their best songs only? 

Anyway here are the most commonly mentioned ones that I missed with more than one mention - not exhaustive by any means. 

* Aimer (by far the most common)
* Asian Kung Fu Generation
* JAM Project (as a group - of course the members have their own individual songs as well)
* Flow
* ClariS
* TM Revolution
* UVERWorld
* Sayuri
* Nano
* Megumi hayashibara
* Myth and Roid
* Kana Boon
* Spyair
* SiD
* Kalafina 
* Konomi Suzuki
* Masayoshi Ooishi
* Meg Rock",False,anime,1706556721.0,1ae3wzn

"kids, anime and ratings",Discussion," 

i'm somewhat confused in the wake of the ""death of shojo"" & a few posts asking for recommendations for x aged kids.  
my kid saw me watching aot when she was 7  and i told her she wouldnt understand. she was pretty adamant about  seeing it so i warned her that it might be uncomfortable and watched the  first episode. it took us more than an hour because i had to explain a  lot of concepts. and i had to translate simultaneously.

we  ended up binging the whole thing (2 seasons at that time) in 3 or 4  days and spent most of the time we wetent watching talking about it.

the  list of anime we watched since(5 years) is pretty wild and i gotta say  that she has grown as person and learned english well enough to participate in school competitions without any additional effort. and  she took up volleyball becasue of haikyu!!

by grown as a person i mean gained a lot of understanding in what motivates people, morality etc.

why  do people abide by age restrictions when it is clearly an arbitrary  number that tells you nothing about how your child would react to it. same goes for ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" shows.

"""Fate: Unlimited Blade Works"" Is My Latest Disappointment",Discussion,"2024. The year in which I finally committed myself to watching Fate series.

After some personal research and fellow enthusiast recommendations, I decided to start with Ufotable's remake from 2014. First of all, the animation really popped - it's fantastic! Many recent shows wished they had that level of quality to their presentation. However, that's the full extent of my praise for the show...

1. The soundtrack is decent to good. Has some cool atmospheric tracks but nothing that got my blood pumping. Maybe that's just a symptom of watching the anime 10 years later than I was supposed to, when standards were a bit lower. Still, not really a negative but rather a neutral point - which I decided to point out first, as the rest will be all negative;
2. The artstyle is... odd, to say the least. Facial features look bland (maybe due to how the nose stands out when compared to how the other features are drawn). It's also intriguing how the design of certain secondary characters seemed better to me than the two main characters;
3. The story is not exciting, even as a character-driven tale. The so-called Holy Grail War feels like what you would get if you considered a Battle Royale map, but dropped just 7 players there rather than dozens of them - without some ""cloud of doom"" sense of urgency. The narrative felt like it was shambling forward, without a sense of momentum. A lot was said about life goals, something that was regurgitated over and over again (one specific episode before an important late S2 battle was focused entirely on delivering that message yet again) - this makes the show feel less intelligent as a result, pretending that its themes are deeper and more complex than what they are. The character-related twist was also extremely predictable;
4. The fights are very dull, despite the stellar animation. Most of them were either fast blade clashes without any sense of choreography (like a kid smashing a piece of LEGO against another) or projectile spams. Again, maybe I am spoiled by recent products, but I feel like there was little creativity put into the moves themselves.

As such, I am left with an okay anime that excels in one front, averages on many others and underdelivers on a couple more. It's especially disappointing since it's apparently regarded as one of the finest products of the Fate series - so chances of enjoying the rest are considerably lower.

EDIT: Forgot to mention, under ""Story"" topic: there was an absurd amount of rule-bending in this anime. Things that shouldn't have been possible, suddenly were, for the sake of plot - Servants ignoring Command Spells, power levels going up and down depending on whether they attacked other Servants or Masters, Servant summoning other Servants, mana consumption, resurrections etc.

Looking for a specific kind of romance anime. (Challenge Mode: I've seen 95% of the obvious recommendations!),What to Watch?,"Watching a good anime romance is probably one of the most entertaining experiences I've had watching anime. So, I'm looking for some recommendations. Here's what I like - 

1. More comedy than drama. Rom-coms are always fun. Don't get me wrong, SOME drama is ok - Oregairu, Masamune's Revenge, Our Dating Story etc. Just no ""other guy"" business. Basically, don't want NTR crap.

2. The FMC realizes her feelings early on. She doesn't need to be super sure or confess early on. But she knows she feels something and the series is just gonna progressively build on it - Kaguya, Dangers in My Heart, Angel Next Door etc. Basically, don't wanna drag the ""I'm not sure I like him like that"" portion too long.

But I've probably seen most of the obvious recs and that's gonna be a challenge. But still, I'd love to know what you all liked that like this.",False,anime,1706545909.0,1adzfa1
I don't like Anime but read first....then help?,What to Watch?,"Hi, I hope I can make this as detailed and concise.

I am a film and TV addict there isn't much I don't like(apart from romcoms or musicals lawrd lol) but Anime I can't get my head around it. I love animation though I watch ALOT of animated shows and films.

Now I love Studio Ghibli and honestly didn't think it was under the Anime category cus it looked and felt different I thought only sharp drawings and wacky characters were Anime cus they all look kinda the same tbh.

**Reasons**

\- The way it's drawn i really just don't appreciate that sort of art and watching it isn't enjoyable. I do prefer the art of things like Spirited Away, Blue Eye Samurai, Carol and the end of the world, Rick and Morty, Star Trek : Lower Deck, Master of the Universe things like that just more appealing to my eyes. ( I mean I'm someone who watches Cupcake and Dino to go to sleep lol so my art taste is varied)

\- Its just a lot going on and very dramatic and feels like there is no plot sometimes, like the cinematography isn't my fave something seems very anxiety-inducing and not very smooth to process reminds me of trying to watch Pokemon as a kid and just hating it.

\- Colour pallet - the colours are very harsh and don't fit the scenes alot everything is SOOO BRIGHT

\- I find it very wacky that they just talk sooo dramatically like RELAX this isn't a kdrama lol even their expressions its just seems like I can't take it seriously. And I am all for a bit of wild narratives but it feels like there is no downtime.

\- Anime community is the weirdest community I've encountered in the realm of visual media. Every other film/tv fans are happy to really talk about scenes and quotes and the actors but with anime is very much a ""If you know you know"" and i don't care about being part of some cool club i just wanna enjoy film and tv lol

&#x200B;

What I have tried - I have tried many more but these ones I gave a good conscious effort.

\- Now I have tried **Castlevania** as a friend recommended it and we have same tastes. it seems like it would be slow with nice colour pallet and less waky but i honestly couldn't stand the art the way the characters are drawn and considering I love Rick and Morty weird.

\- **Cowboy Bebop,** a few reddit comments mentioned this as its more adult and lawrd bored to death and honestly hated the art but I watched the live-action - it was good enough.

\- I did enjoy **Akira** in the cinema I really liked the cinematography, storyline and what an ending it was a whole experience i still go to the anniversary showings of it cus wow amazing!

\- **Tokyo Ghoul** \- loved the start cus I thought okay wow  never seen anything like this with the blood dripping then it switched to those harsh yellow colours with the boys in the cafe and those sharp lines they use to draw them and immediately put off

\- **Kotaro Lives alone** \- honestly one of my faves the storyline was just 10/10 for me no matter what the art looked like. It reminded me of My life as a Courgette loved it.

\- **Lookism** now this was just a very interesting but random storyline lol it makes me laugh this may be one of the series that i truly enjoyed and laughed a bit  that resembles that sort of classic anime style I don't really like but very dramatic in places but they did have downtime from the wacky facial expressions

&#x200B;

What Id love some help with- with all I said could you recommend some anime where the artwork is different and smoother? I feel like all the reddit comments I see only mention the same 10 animes and i dont like any of them, if there is another corner of this anime world Id love to know-

&#x200B;

\- Looking for :

\- 3 really good films to sink my teeth in with amazing storylines

\- 3 good series I can get into the storyline and characters that have nothing to do with vampires.

\- 3 good ones that are slow and nice to sleep too but none of that pitched cutesy stuff

\- any good LGBTQ ones would be amazing but i don't care about an amazing love story, if it isn't ripping their hearts out with some sort of scandal then leave me out of it

Some things to note:

\- I don't like coming of age stories unless its like the film Belgium 'Close""

\- I don't like stuff set in schools

\- No vampire stuff

\- Love heist films, sci fi, action, psych thriller ( Lady vengeance, Lobster, The Skin I live in vibes)

Thank you!

&#x200B;

**Quick update**\-29th Jan- Thank you soo much for those who have replied! I am coming from a place of open mind and open heart that is why I made my post. ✉️  


Today was the first day I sat down and tried to think why I didn't like anime hence why coming across as ""critical"" but i never thought about it deeply before if I didn't like it I would move on but I wanted to come to this community with some details so I don't waste everyones time just arguing in the comments and wanted to come from a well throughout place.   


Everything that gets recommended today I will take seriously and watch at least 2 episodes of series recommended and 30 mins of a film recommended! I have already started 2 and loving it already so I guess me not liking Anime is slowly wearing off so quickly - just had to find the right genre it seems?

My focus this week will be
- Chainsaw man
- Perfect Blue
- Lupin

 Thanks again people will update on my thoughts on the ones suggested.

What are some people’s favorite romance anime with proper conflict?,Discussion,"Just felt Iike having such a discussion as I’ve been watching KimiZero sometimes recently, and I wanted to understand why it kind of had a hard time resonating with fans of modern romance anime.




But then I believe it’s because the show doesn’t have a lot of conflict or drama going on as I’ve seen about 5 episodes so far, and from what I’ve seen, don’t get me wrong as I do like the moe aesthetic that it has in its presentation such as Runa Shirakawa’s design, but I feel like the show is playing it a bit safe as again there’s not a lot of conflict going on in the series.





TLDR: I just wanted to understand what makes a solid romance anime such as the stuff that makes people love modern romance series, and I was using KimiZero as an example to understand what people expect in a modern romance show, like if conflict is necessary to establish, although maybe I am wrong about that.",False,anime,1706545231.0,1adz5ml
Name of the anime with this plot it’s not called papercraft,Help,"Plot:
Haru is a young girl who stumbles upon a mysterious portal hidden in her attic. Curiosity getting the better of her, she steps through and finds herself in a breathtaking world entirely crafted from paper. The landscape is filled with intricate paper sculptures, towering paper buildings, and vibrant paper forests.

As Haru explores this fantastical realm, she encounters various challenges and puzzles that she must solve to uncover the secrets of the paper world. Along the way, she befriends a diverse cast of characters, including talking animals, sentient origami creatures, and wise paper spirits.

However, Haru soon discovers that the paper world is in peril. An ancient curse threatens to unravel the very fabric of this delicate realm, turning everything into ordinary paper and condemning its inhabitants to a fate of dissolution. With the help of her newfound friends, Haru embarks on a perilous journey to find the source of the curse and save the paper world from destruction.

Themes:
The movie explores themes of creativity, imagination, and the power of friendship. Through Haru's adventures, viewers are reminded of the beauty and fragility of the world around them, as well as the importance of cherishing and preserving the wonders of the imagination.

Animation Style:
The animation style of Papercraft is whimsical and enchanting, with lush, hand-drawn landscapes and characters brought to life through vibrant colors and intricate paper textures. Each scene is meticulously crafted to evoke the tactile sensation of paper, creating a visually stunning and immersive experience for the audience.",False,anime,1706545153.0,1adz4gm

"What do you think of the protagonist of Classroom of the Elite? Should I watch it, if I don't like him?",Discussion,"Ok so for the longest time I've seen people praise this anime, but to me the protagonist just gives off edgy cringe teenage boy vibes. Btw, this is all just assumptions, I just want to know if I'm wrong or right about this.

Like he looks like

1. Allergic to emotions or expressions
2. Tries to act cool 24 7
3. Is an asshole
4. is self insert (like those isekai or harem mc type)
5. has a harem for the reasons mentioned above

Please help me remember the name of this anime,Help,"Ok, i saw this anime on a tiktok and for the life of me cant remember the name,

From what i remember the MC is a highschooler who for some reason IDK goes onto the school roof or something similar where he meets a girl, (i assume the love interest) Shes there sleeping, but with a petal on her face. He attempts to take it off her but only ends up waking her up, after a very brief accusation of ""taking a peek"" She says to make it up to her they should skip school and go shopping. the MC has some sort of powers that allow him to see emotions via colours emmited around a person, however this girl who i believe to wear a yellow jumper (school uniform?) doesnt have any colour emitting from her.

&#x200B;

That is about all i can remember, I think the guy has black hair and a standard anime school uniform, while i THINK the girl is wearing a skirt and yellow jumper as the school uniform, I think the girl may be blonde but honestly might be a guess.

Need Guidance on Anime Watching Order – Beginner Looking for Recommendations!,What to Watch?,"Hey fellow anime enthusiasts! 👋🏻

I recently got into the anime world and I'm loving it so far. I started with Attack on Titan and now I'm diving into Baki. However, I've got this list of other anime that I'm eager to explore, and I'm looking for some advice on the best order to watch them.

Here's the list I've compiled:

* Attack on Titan (already watched)
* Baki (currently watching)
* Jujutsu Kaisen
* Demon Slayer
* Solo Leveling
* Magic muscles
* Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
* Hunter x Hunter
* Death Note
* Blue Lock
* One-Punch Man

* Vinland Saga
* Chainsaw Man
* Castlevania
* Made in Abyss
* Cowboy Bebop
* Blue Eye Samurai
* Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
* My Hero Academia
* Black Clover
* One Piece

I was thinking of starting from the ones with the least runtime and then moving to the longer ones. Additionally, I'm open to watching Original Video Animations (OVAs), just like I'm currently doing with Baki.

Why promiscuous anime dudes are so rare?,Discussion,"Ok, most of the male anime characters are either super chaste/celibate when it comes to their sexuality or others are sex offenders/perverts who are straight up criminals and also violate sexual boundaries of other people/women.

Anyone else tired of the main ship always landing successfully/ be blatantly obvious in Romance/SoL? (Spoilers for ToraDora and Oregairu),Discussion,"Has anyone ever noticed that whatever character the main hero/heroine interacts with is usually always the one the one they end up with.

Like for example Oregairu's main love triangle ( we all know Iroha was never gonna win ) is interesting because maybe season one/early season two it's kinda of a toss up on Yui and Yukino but like season three any chance of Yui winning was sent to hell to the visual novel alt route devil. Although it makes more sense narrative wise to why Yukino won + it wraps up 8man's character arc but I'd be lying if I said I didn't want Yui to win because I thought they had more on screen chemistry in the earlier seasons.

ToraDora is the biggest culprit of this. Don't give me a character like Ami who's super compelling and interesting when I know it's gonna be a washout near the end of the series because Taiga is essentially the main character of the series.

I'm not saying I hate it completely. Most of the time it makes more sense for the story. It's just kinda disappointing to see the character relationships develop and the story trying to build up the myster who will win when they do an awful job at concealing it",False,anime,1706498711.0,1adldgh

The Fire Hunter - Anime of the Week,Weekly,"Welcome to the weekly Anime of the Week Discussion Thread! Each week, we're here to discuss various older anime series. Today we are discussing...

## The Fire Hunter

Human civilization no longer revolves around fire, but is instead now driven by fear of it. Repeated wars have changed human biology, and people now spontaneously combust when they get close to natural flame. However, a new source of energy prevents society from complete collapse: a stone-shaped material used to produce light and steam lies within the bodies of monsters that infest numerous forests. Those tasked with collecting this precious resource are called fire hunters.

Touko, a young village girl, is saved from a forest monster by a fire hunter who perishes during his heroic action. After the hunter's dog, Kanata, heals from his own injury, the girl's family sends her to the capital in order to return Kanata and the hunter's fire sickle to his relatives.

Elsewhere, the fire hunter's son, Koushi, and his sister are adopted by a wealthy family. Koushi learns some troubling facts related to the country's ruling royal family. He conducts secret research on a special fire stone found by his late father, kickstarting a race against time between the country's leaders and those trying to save mankind from its ultimate demise.

1. Greed Island: Everything in this arc just clicked with me. Gon and Killua’s bond with Bisky, the introduction of their Nen abilities, the dodgeball game, and the Greed Island video game itself perfectly shows Ging’s viewpoints on life and gives us insight onto who he is. 10/10 Godsend

2. Heavens Arena: I’m a sucker for tournament based stuff, so this was an immediate hit for me. Gon and Killua had so many badass moments here. 9.5/10 Truly Amazing

3. Yorknew City: Kurapika is a total fucking boss, and the Phantom Troupe is an awesome antagonist group. 9/10 Amazing

4. Chimera Ant: This arc has some flaws that I think some people overlook, particularly Gon and Killua’s sidelining, but the fight scenes were great, I like some of our new allies, Meruem’s great, and the arcs Gon and Killua had were peak, so I can forgive most of my issues. 8.5/10 Fantastic

5. Hunter Exam: An awesome start to an amazing series. Also, Illini fucking sucks! 8/10 Awesome

6. Zoldyak Family: A great five episode arc that helps expand on Killua’s already great character. 7.5/10 Cool

7. Chairman Election: It was okay, but the boring-ass election and Gon being out of commission for most of it kinda threw me off. The manga got lucky due to being able to continue after this. 5/10 Okay",False,anime,1706483572.0,1adg4bk

Mawaru Penguindrum Rewatch Interest Thread,Rewatch,"***”Listen, you lowlifes who will never amount to anything.”***

---

Hey guys! I’ve been toying with hosting a rewatch for Penguindrum since basically right after I finished it- It’s a really fun show, compelling in its subject matter, but it also contains incredibly complex symbolism, and without a lot of concentration, it’s very difficult to get what the show is going for. I had a fantastic time with the Utena rewatch I hosted back in 2021, and being that it’s made by the same director, this is a very similar type of show, and it should hopefully produce a similarly enjoyable rewatch experience. 

Additionally, two movies under the name of Re:cycle of the Penguindrum were released in English last year, and I hope to include those in the rewatch as well. I believe they’re mostly recap movies, but they also contain new scenes, and in any case, it should be fun to compare the two.

With the interest I’ve seen already from CDF over the past couple of years, the rewatch is almost certain to happen, but this thread is to gauge how much interest I should expect from the rest of the subreddit. I hope you join us!

**Summary**

Shouma and Kanba Takakura receive the news that their sister Himari has at most a few months left to live. They take her to the aquarium to go see the penguins, but while they’re there Himari collapses, seemingly passing away. However, in the hospital, a miracle occurs- Himari rises from her hospital bed, wearing a novelty penguin hat purchased from the aquarium. But everything has a price, or so the spirit within the hat claims. The show escalates from there.

Penguindrum draws inspiration from the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin attacks. It looks at the lingering trauma of such events, as well as the societal factors and conditions that create them. The show isn't directly about the sarin attacks, but that focus forms the thematic basis of Penguindrum's core motifs alongside works such as Night on the Galactic Railroad. It will be helpful to keep these influences in mind.

Anyone knows the title of this anime?,Help,"Hello. I’ve been looking for years for an anime or Japanese animation I’ve used to watch as a kid. I was watching it in the 2000s, so it is was definitely released before 2010, at least the first episode (I don’t know how many episodes there are or even if there are other episodes as I’ve always been watching the same part).
I have no idea of what the title could be and only vaguely remember a few scenes, so I’ll try to describe what I remember with as many details as possible.

- The main character is a young boy. In a scene in the beginning, he is eating food from a bowl with chopsticks with his family and his father is on the opposite side of the table, reading a newspaper holding it mid-air, covering his face. At some point, the boy hears something that disrupts him and spits the food on his dad’s newspaper.

- in a later scene, the boy is walking in the city, if I remember well along the river. Suddenly, the time freezes, and long, mechanical serpent-dragons piloted by people led by a wicked woman appear. A fight starts and some structures, including tall factory chimneys, are destroyed due to the collision of the dragons on them, and the boy finds himself piloting one of these as well.

- Later, the boy finds himself in a building. We don’t see the outside of the building, but it looks like an industrial style building, mostly made of metal and with metal bridges. It appears to be the evil people that attacked him earlier with the dragons’ lair. They are still led by the wicked woman and are chasing him. At some point, he is trying to escape from them with another girl.

- In the final part, the boy is holding at the edge of one of the metal bridges, trying to avoid falling into the dark and seemingly endless pit beneath him. The girl he was escaping with is leaning above him. At some point, he loses his grip and grabs the girl’s necklace, then falls into the dark.
In the scene right after, the boy crashes through the building’s wall (that for some reason I remember is made of some kind of fabric), miraculously saving himself holding to a bar. He is now outside, and we now see that the building is actually a very tall tower, and he is hovering over the void. It is dawn, and the boy looks at the horizon, seeing other towers. He realizes that he has been transported to another place, maybe another world or dimension. Then the episode ends.

That’s pretty much all I can remember. Some details may be inaccurate, but I hope I gave sufficient clues to find the title of this anime.
Thanks to anyone who can help.",False,anime,1706479571.0,1adek73

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
Hirmuolio has some extra details about the Lain game for us to explore! 
>When the anime Lain was made a the same time a ps1 game Lain was also made.

>The ps1 game is some weird shit made up from disconnected audio logs and video scenes. The story is very different and more disturbing.  

>Here some sort of playthough of it: https://youtu.be/5m5CTaF-qHE?si=zaRFuBR0Frq6QeSm

>Also a short comic for the ps1 game https://e-hentai.org/s/fc548e26b4/1667524-1



 zoospor made [a very in depth comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1acm6bt/comment/kjwqeva) yesterday that I strongly recommend reading all the way through 

Ytar is on team Adorable Bear onesie!! 

> I don't want to admit to the idea that Lain of the Bear Onesie is a ""fake"" Lain. Simple as that. All of her versions seem to be equally fake and equally real. [It's still real to me damn it!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yvd3aEsThbc&t=12s)



Weedwacker gave us an adorable bear onesie explanation~

>The [light](https://imgur.com/abVD0Tj) coming [through](https://imgur.com/OtGYTYl) the [bear pajamas](https://imgur.com/FLVWuNS) is such a beautiful sequence representing Lain coming out of her safety blanket and accepting who she is.

>The idea for the bear pajamas came from the character designer, Takahiro Kishida, and was initially opposed before being incorporated.

>To quote Chiaki Konaka

>> When Lain has to communicate with her family, she wears the pajamas, and she puts on the hat with the bear character when she goes out.  It's like a shield to protect her from the outside world.

* Lain is very much one of those series that you're not expected to *""get""* your first time around. Is there an anime series that comes to mind that you gained an appreciation for long after your initial viewing? 
* What would you say was your favourite episode of the show? Favourite moment? 
* Is there another series you would recommend to fans of Lain if they want more? 
* Please tell me what your favourite Question of the Day has been? Which one gave the most entertaining answers to you? 
* Is Lain literally you fr fr!? 
* Had Lain inspired you to invest in a new animal themed onesie yet? 
* And for our last Question of the Rewatch... Its YOU!! Everybody please nominate their top rewatch member!! Who's comments have you eagerly been refreshing the page to read their thoughts each day and night? Is it Tarhanlindur and his spoiler sense crossovers? Alphie and their consistent efforts to dominate the Abyssbringer corner? Or maybe you want to congratulate RadSuit for somehow managing to finish the rewatch without cracking?

>Lain is fucking dead. She decided that the world was better off without her and ended her own life, dreaming that she could be forgotten so all of the suffering she blamed herself for could be undone. She meets not just *her* father, but *the* father, who lifts her from that purgatorial space she had subjected herself to, believing she deserved it. Lain weeps when her love is recognized because that is all she ever wanted. He tells her that he'll make tea ""next time"" because Lain isn't really gone; she lives on in the hearts and minds of the people that cared about her.

>The only one that sees her is Arisu, whom I already concluded was having some Lain-centric hallucinations last episode, but perhaps she was sent down to get another chance to learn that she truly was loved. Arisu - and any of us, for that matter - can see Lain at any time because we can always remember her and the impact this story had on us. Or we can rewatch the show

##Next Rewatch! 

I've moved this down from the Question of the Day cause it was kinda clogging the whole thing up XD 

So our next rewatch is up in the air... I would like to cover both Haibane and Texhnolyze to complete our trifecta and due to personal interest I will likely host Haibane first. What I would like to ask however is if you'd appreciate a ""palette cleanser"" to help brighten us up? Apparently Haibane isn't as happy and iyashikei as I expected and Lain's a pretty big downer. I have a few possible options for us. We could do I could do [Otome Yokai Zakuro](https://myanimelist.net/anime/8476/Otome_Youkai_Zakuro) which is a softer romance that has a totally stacked VA cast that this rewatch group would appreciate. The last option would be to go straight back to a pure comedy. So Asobi Asobase or Chiyo's School Road. I really don't know tbh... Another possible fun option that's been mentioned a few times is [Kuma Kuma Kuma Kuma Punch](https://youtu.be/WnwcCXr1v7c?si=4sv8DzqdBTjqY2E3) which could satiate this rewatch viewerbase's massive obsession with bear onesie and pyjama parties. I'm happy to do whatever you all like. If you think you can cope with diving straight into Haibane Renmei, please say. I'm happy to host anything you fancy so long as its not about a transgender piss activist

The Sky Crawlers Rewatch Interest Thread,Rewatch,"Hello, r/Anime! Today I’m here to try and commemorate one of the most obscure and underappreciated anime of all time, The Sky Crawlers.

#What is The Sky Crawlers?

The Sky Crawlers was a 2008 film directed by Mamoru Oshii, of Ghost in the Shell fame, and animated at Production IG, adapted from the 2001 novel of the same name. The premise is as follows:

In the near future, where war is waged between corporations, a fighter pilot named Yuichi Kannami transfers to a new airbase called Area 262. However, as he adjusts to his new environment and starts to grow close to his compatriots (especially his commanding officer, Suito Kusanagi), a mystery begins to emerge which might redefine everything both he and the audience knows about themselves and the world.

#Why should I watch it?

The Sky Crawlers is a bizarre yet fascinating film. Despite its premise which might lead you to believe it’s full of warfare and action, the movie is fundamentally a slow-paced, atmospheric thinkpiece. It invites you to indulge in and contemplate the overpowering, ever-present feeling of wrongness and emptiness which is masterfully crafted through its sharp direction and somber soundtrack as the layers of its world and themes unfold before you. And as the plot progresses, all the pieces laid out to you through its presentation begin to fit together and coalesce, creating a clear, impactful critique of society which is just as biting today as it was when the film first released.

But beyond its high-minded philosophy and thick atmosphere, the Sky Crawlers is fundamentally a very grounded, very human story about two people trying to find their place in the world. Both Kannami and Kusanagi are excellently-characterized, with a level of subtle nuance and growth which ties the whole film together.

#Where can I watch it?

The film is available for rent or purchase digitally on [Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.96a9f7b8-852e-a1aa-3354-f7206adde1fd?autoplay=0&ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/movies/details?id=ayn8Akrm93g), [Apple TV](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/the-sky-crawlers/umc.cmc.6hrcpf84uu2dr3xegj4ms2raf?action=play), and [Vudu](https://www.vudu.com/content/browse/details/The-Sky-Crawlers/143317?cmp=OrganicSearch~Vudu~GoogleWatch).

I have always been weird about anime and thought it was weird for people to watch. But recently I remember this video game I used to play on PlayStation 2 it was dragon ball z and remember how much I liked it. So I want to start on a anime series of my own to form my own thoughts.,What to Watch?,Is Dragon Ball z a good show to start watching.

Chat Gippty failed me. Can you help?,What to Watch?,"I'm new to Anime and have a Crunchyroll subscription. I tried asking Chat Gippity for a recommendation on what to watch next but I wasn't satisfied with the answer. I've watched the following animes so far:

Absolute Favorites:

* Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation
   * The first anime and Isekai I watched. It has been hard to find one I like more. I really enjoy the story, the magic system, the character growth, just everything about it.
* ReLife
   * I'm a sucker for some romance and the characters being adults (although still in a highschool setting) I found interesting. The last few episodes was a roller coaster of emotions.
* Re:Zero
   * My second favorite Isekai. I found the character's development to be good, although very painful, in the end was very rewarding. I appreciate some of the psychological horror aspects.
* To Your Eternity
   * This one really made me emotional. I appreciate anime that can really move me, and this one definitely did. Lots of bitter sweetness in this one.

Runner up Favorites:

* Spy x Family
   * This one is just super cute and I love how wholesome it is.
* Kaguya-Sama: Love is War
   * This was the first romance anime I watched and it set a high bar. I enjoyed the slow burn and the absolute comedy that was the narrator. It really was quite cute.
* Your lie in April
   * Like with To Your Eternity, this was a tear jerker for sure. I do like the bitter sweet ones. It almost has some Omori (the game) vibes to it.
* The Quintessential Quintuplets
   * I was in a harem kick for a bit and this one came up, and was not what I expected. I loved the 5 way tug of war and in the end felt satisfied with the result.
* Code Geass
   * From the first episode this one was both a brutal and captivating anime. The action and the emotional turmoil was top notch.

Pretty Good Ones:

* The World God Only Knows
   * I loved how this one poked fun at a lot of tropes. Very fun watch.
* High-school DxD
   * Loved the story and character building, and of course the ecchi elements.
* Toradora!
   * Romance wise I thought this one was cute, though I felt the ending was kinda meh.
* Hyouka
   * Again romance themed, I thought this one was fun, especially the mystery almost Scooby Doo elements.
* Kill la Kill
   * I just love how unhinged this anime was. I felt like someone put the story in a rocket and has it do laps in orbit.

Alright Ones:

* Your Name
   * A pretty good romance anime movie. It was a bit predictable, but not in a bad way.

Meh Ones:

* Paranoia Agent
   * I had really hoped this one would have been better. The story was relatively interesting but the ending had me wishing there was something more/different.
* Shuffle!
   * Like with Paranoia Agent it was really strong at first and then just kind fell off at the last few episodes.
* How Not To Summon A Demon Lord
   * I was in a harem ecchi kick and I thought this one would be good, but I just felt the story wasn't that great.

Given this list, and that I only have a Crunchyroll subscription, what would you recommend I watch next?

The Supernatural Battles show looks very interesting,Help,"I mean sure I haven’t seen too much of aside from the “I don’t understand it” moment, but it’s just that I recall like it was yesterday when it was still a fairly recent anime in general.




I mean sure I should just go see it as it’s done by Studio Trigger themselves, but my concern is that I don’t know how much of the novels it covers, but I guess what I am trying to get at is that the show is fascinating to look back for its somewhat dark nature.




Like again even though that “I don’t understand” moment is basically all I know about the show, my point is that to me it’s quite fascinating how a modern anime series can pull off such a tone shift as back then, it seemed that viewers were expecting a standard moe based fantasy when it first came out, but it seems that particular moment really caught viewers off guard as it was pretty jarring due to the aforementioned dark tones that episode had.",False,anime,1706470525.0,1adaxys

# IMPORTANT NOTICE:

I watched and read the Semi-final and the Very Final ahead of schedule and I am going to say, that ***I STRONGLY RECOMMEND*** to read chapters 687-698 after finishing the Semi-Final OVAs ***because*** those two OVA episodes are abridged version of those chapters and besides of leaving out some jokes like [the girls torturing Hijikata, and leaving him in a state of Post Mayo Clarity](https://imgur.com/a/TohpEZg), Semi-Final OVAs left out an important scenes with Takasugi and Katsura, that are crucial to the Very Final Movie.

*(Although the Movie will very briefly mention what they were doing during Semi-Final with a sentence or two.)*

Plus Chapter 691 wasn’t adapted at all.

If you won’t read chapters 687-698 before watching the Very Final, you can read the summary of what was omitted from the adaptation of the Semi-Final OVAs in my comment during next Sunday.

**Regarding spoilers:**

Rewatchers please don't talk without using spoiler tags \[Spoilers\] >!like this about events which still didn't happen in anime, don't name characters that weren't introduced yet, don't post pictures of characters yet to be introduced, and try to refrain from using arcs and episodes names yet to be introduced.!<

There will be first timers discussing it together with us and I believe nobody here wants them to be spoiled.

"What Have You Watched This Past Week That is NOT a Currently Airing Show? [January 28th, 2023]",Weekly,"Title says it all - talk about the anime you watched this past week that are not a part of this Winter 2024 season (like **Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun 2nd Stage** or **Dungeon Meshi**), or a show that's continuing from previous seasons (like **Sousou no Frieren**).

With regards to Fall 2023 shows, however, it would be fine to write about them as long as you only began them after they finished airing. For example, it's fine to talk about watching **The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You** or **Arknights: Perish in Frost** if you started them after the final episode aired. Obviously, use your best judgement on this.

**Please use spoiler tags**; it's super simple stuff. An example below:

        [KonoSuba Ep 9] >!""THIS WAS A VERY BAD EPISODE, DARKNESS DID NOT DESERVE THAT!<

comes out to be [KonoSuba Ep 9] >!""THIS WAS A VERY BAD EPISODE, DARKNESS DID NOT DESERVE THAT!<

What is the meaning of black swords that often can be seen as an important sign in anime/manga?,Help,"Tanjiro’s sword from Demon slayer, Mihawk’s sword Yoru (meaning dark) which is the strongest sword in the world and Ichigo’s Zanpakuto are all black swords, that belong to important very strong characters. In one piece it is said that a lot of will power/ambition spirit or whatever is the exact translation of Haki can turn a sword black. In Demon slayer it is said that black swords are rare (and again it’s no other than the owner of the sword himself that  turned it black) and in Bleach ichigo is the blade and the blade is ichigo and it is as dark as void and in his bankai form he is dressed in black just like his surname Kurosaki (black cape) suggests. Whatever the case it is always hinted that black swords are strong or important, but what do they symbolise? Is their meaning destruction, strength or maybe even discipline?

What is a good anime to watch with no weight to it?,What to Watch?,"I want to watch an anime that is honestly kinda ""pointless."" Something that doesn't have any real plot and I can kinda just watch whenever I want. Something that doesn't make me feel the dire weight of the dire ongoing plot of the show.

I did see an anime like this once, and it is now my favorite. It is called Nichijou. So👏good👏.

Thanks!",False,anime,1706455774.0,1ad5483

Stuff like bandersnatch, cat burgular, or the newly Netflix interactive series choose love. 

It's something getting explored a bit more but it's still super obscure I'd say. So I thought, what if an anime had choices and you take the helm of someone who's a complete Joe shmoe. A character that is you but you make choices in a world that isn't through cgs like visual novels. Rather a moving world through animation and choices can make the viewer experiment what path, people, and things happen within the story.

Top 10 hardest anime universes to live in?,Discussion,"If you had to pick a universe , 10 being the easiest to survive and 1 being the hardest what would it be?

I was sitting here trying to figure something out and I was having trouble. Oddly enough I think rise of the shield hero is up there with hardest to live in because waves spawn everywhere and depending on who your heros are they may be inadequate.

Naruto would be hard if your not from the leaf, otherwise your fine because the leaf is stacked

Bleach is kinda safe oddly enough for regular people, the soul society does a good job hiding battles.

DBZ your whole planet could die

Hunter x hunter is probably not that bad for regular people

MHA can be pretty dangerous

Goblin slayer would be fucking scary

Are there any anime you wish had the same style as the manga?,Discussion,"I can think of many examples that my friends have said such as maybe fire force or chainsaw man- both have distinct manga styles but the anime look a little too generic and samey to other productions.

I know loads of manga have a too intricate and beautiful style that would be too time consuming to animate, but I'd love your thoughts! :)

I prefer the more 'soul eater' style of the manga since I love the art the mangaka has done

"Looking for a specific anime, thank you!",Help,"I'm hoping I'm doing this correctly and whee I need to, if not feel free to remove. I'm looking for an anime that I watched several years ago, around the 2000s. So the main character is a teenage guy who's living in a rather remote village, one day a girl (At least I think it was a girl) drops in because she's been looking for the legendary weapons of the heroes. Some more stuff happens but then I remember he summoned one of the weapons, as the heroes left all their weapons to him, and fights against a demon with it. Then some stuff happens where the demon lord (Or their ranking official) and then they fight in a few episodes. I think (Heavy emphasis on think) that it was only one season with around 24 episodes and he had weapons like a sword, a bow, a spear and more (I think there was around 5-10, somewhere in that range). It's an older anime so I'm hoping someone will know about it because I want to watch it again. Thank you for your time and help!",False,anime,1706419785.0,1acv97x

"Best Valentine's Day Episode in Anime for you, and did you ever get inspired to try something similar?",Discussion,"Since we have quite a good Valentine's day episode today (Boku Yabai / Danger in my Heart S2), and the day is only a little more than a fortnight away, this gave me the idea of the community service of ""think back on the Valentine's day episodes you watched and did you learn anything to apply in your life?""

Just on top of my head, the very best episode of Valentine's day sadly hasn't been actually adapted yet (Haruhi), but in the Haruhi-chan parody it's got a fairly [funny version](https://youtu.be/WNqeHRrMXLQ) as a [2 parter](https://youtu.be/BT1SJ6Md_Gk).

The Nagato spin off also had a really nice arc that culminated to a [little gag](https://imgur.com/DMM011T) of [status quo](https://imgur.com/a/zduQS4H).

Komi-san had a pretty nice episode (but I think was marred by a significant production value drop) that has a really rewarding scene that was earned through the almost 2 seasons.

Going back much further, Kimagure Orange Road had a bit of a chaotic episode, but the end scene was so very nice and again earned.

Unfortunately for me I really don't have any situation that I can apply to, but someone just might :)

The man in the suit would show up and point at the person and the screen would start flashing. This anime looked pretty old but I wouldn't know the time frame.

Paranoia Agent 20th Anniversary Rewatch one week reminder,Rewatch,"Hey, guys. Holofan4life here. 

I am pleased to announce that I will be hosting the 20th anniversary rewatch of Paranoia Agent

##What is Paranoia Agent about?

The infamous Shounen Bat is terrorizing the residents of Musashino City. Flying around on his rollerblades and beating people down with a golden baseball bat, the assailant seems impossible to catch—much less understand. His first victim, the well-known yet timid character designer Tsukiko Sagi, is suspected of orchestrating the attacks. Believed only by her anthropomorphic pink stuffed animal, Maromi, Tsukiko is just one of Shounen Bat's many victims.

As Shounen Bat continues his relentless assault on the town, detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa begin to investigate the identity of the attacker. However, more and more people fall victim to the notorious golden bat, and news of the assailant begins circulating around the town. Paranoia starts to set in as chilling rumors spread amongst adults and children alike.

Will the two detectives be able to unravel the truth behind Shounen Bat, or will the paranoia get to them first?

##Why should I watch Paranoia Agent?

Paranoia Agent is the brainchild of Satoshi Kon. He is the director of acclaimed films such as Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, and Tokyo Godfathers. This is his one and only TV show he was the creator and director for. I've really been getting into his work as of late, and I really want to check out the TV show he created. And what better timing given it's the 20 year anniversary than to watch it with you guys?

I'm looking for a relatively big anime that I'll have good memories off,What to Watch?,"In few weeks my vacation will finish and I'll start a new stage of my life, so I want to binge-watch an relatively big anime in a week or half to be some sort of my last memorable anime in a while. I want one that I will always remember in future for its quality, eccentricitie or some stuff like that. About the length of the anime, I don't have any quantity in specific, but I want something like 40+ eps but not super big so I can actually finish (at least one season) in a week or half binge-watching.
I like almost any kind of genres in anime so feel free to recommend me any! Also, I have my myanimelist in my bio if u want to see what I've already seen or something like that

To make it easier, I'll say some animes that I like and maybe has a similar quantity of eps as the one I'm wondering to find:
Fullmetal Alchemist;
Monster;
Monogatari Series;
Jojo;
Kaiji (S1 and S2);

I haven't watched so many big animes so I already considered watching some that are in my plan to watch: Sailor moon, HxH, Sakura Card Captors, Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu, Gintama, Haikyu and some others. But I can't decide one to watch and I want others ideas and suggestions too.",False,anime,1706392829.0,1acm799

What's scarier zoospor? Going to school with a god, or the introvert suddenly becoming outgoing? 

- God Lain is up in the classroom cracking jokes to her classmates she was previously too shy to say a word around. God powers be giving her confidence and shit. Alice is correctly terrified by Lain, as she knows that Lain manipulated reality and changed everyone's memory. Can you even imagine sitting in the same classroom as God? Understandably scary.  

Mofish and Smiley score a jab jab punch one two combo! 

>> If she is this powerful, where exactly is there supposed to be dramatic tension for her?

>After I finish an anime series, I sometimes wonder what the experience would be like if I had watched the last few episodes first (akin to Oscar Wilde's quote about reading a novel backwards).

>You're the only poster thus far I've seen mention that the implications of this episode make the previous ones totally irrelevant in a dramatic sense.

Vaadwaur gave me the funny image in my mind of Eiri getting mad and shuuing Arisu

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      

Alfie wins our last Abyssbringer prompt! Woohoo! 

>  Lain did an instrumentality.

> It's hard for me to spin this one to my preferred ""this is all a hallucination"" explanation, but here goes: Since the last episode we've changed the lens through which we view this world from Lain to Arisu, who is also beginning to experience psychosis, which she associates with Lain putting her in a spiral of ""lose grip on reality > think about Lain > lose grip more > etc"". Lain and Arisu have strong feelings towards each other so they end up in their own world and Arisu's focus on Lain makes *everything* about Lain, especially stuff related to the Wired with which she knows Lain is obsessed.

> It's not that the psychosis is contagious, but perhaps Arisu was always so considerate of Lain because she understood the struggle. Either she but wasn't as bad, was on meds, or hadn't even realized her own condition (maybe a weird comparison, but kinda like how gay and trans kids are often drawn to each other before they even come out due to other aspects of their personalities).

Need help finding name (it’s eating away at me slowly),Help,"I need help finding the name to a really odd anime that I remember watching as a kid on DVD.

Pls help it’s been on my brain for years eating away at my soul I need to know. 

From what I barely remember the plot was centred this group of adults(?) who did live theatre but the B plot had bombs and guns and shit. I will list what I can remember.

- For what could have been a Christmas episode (or movie special I’m still not sure if this was a show or a movie) they were at some sort of outdoors small festival/party. One of the characters, a blonde (?) woman who was very adept with guns, shoots a bullet in the air and another one after at a man dressed in a tree costume and they ricochet one of bullets embed themselves in the wall and the other does not kill the man but hits a target on him.

- Later on the same episode/movie while some of the group were watching/acting in a play the women from the previous scene is having a face off with the episodes/movies antagonist while two (more or less) friends diffuse bombs that are planted in plant pots under the plants I believe. The antagonist is a man with a suitcase. The suitcase is the controller (a device inside the suitcase he inserts his arm into) for a large mech/robot. This robot having a mini gun type gun (three barrels) for an arm. The woman and the antagonist during this fight shoot at each other at the same time and their bullets hit eachother straight on (one golden one silver bullet). She mentions having past ties to mafia in this episode.

- In a different episode (maybe or it’s all one movie it was all on the same disc) the little sister(?) of one of the members of the group runs away for some reason, eventually stumbling on a man telling a story to a group of children, he is a street performer who sells cookies, she wants one but doesn’t have the money for one because she ran away obviously but the dude gives her one anyways (in secret I think). The women from the last two scenes I listed eventually finds her.

- I also loosely remember some B villains who were used as comedy relief. They were shot by the robot in the second scene listed and appear injured in the third scene listed.

- I also remember the group going to a festival where they threw rings or horseshoes.",False,anime,1706386752.0,1acjxos

Watching it actually relaxes me a lot after a stressful day. I've finished watching it twice now and I'm looking for something very similar. An anime that's super chill and wholesome. Any suggestions will be really appreciated!

Thank you!",False,anime,1706379013.0,1acgz29

Jujutsu Kaisen’s fights are the narrative/story.,Discussion,"I don’t know if it’s an unpopular argument but I believe jujutsu kaisen has very good writing. I have seen people throw the argument that it’s just fighting with no substance and weak writing. 
This argument perplex me because sure on the one hand the characters in jjk are nothing special in terms of their personal goals and beliefs.  But well executed and creative fights with lots of moving parts that makes sense is a robust example of great writing. This story is about fighting. It is the substance. Whether it appeals to someone or not is based on personal taste. It does not pretend to be some deep character study but rather focusing on the intricacies of curses and the clashes caused by them. That is what Akutami Gege is writing this story for. Jujutsu Kaisen roughly translates to “Sorcery Fight”. Hopefully I was able to clear some confusion about why jujutsu kaisen seems to be hyper focused on only Fights. 
I would love to hear everyone else’s opinion on the matter.",False,anime,1706377588.0,1acgf76
Looking for a Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro OST,Help,"The soundtrack I'm searching for is not included in the 33 official tracks listed on the Fandom Wiki.

It plays at the end of episode 10 (the one about the singer Aya Eijia), starting around 19:55
It's a melancholy insturmental track with lots of piano and probably saxophone in the background. If anyone knows the title, that's already great help!

I don't know whether the source for the episode I found is illegal or not, so I won't post any links.

Thanks in advance for any help!",False,anime,1706375738.0,1acfpk6

Animation budget was wasted on [Reborn to Master the Blade],Discussion,"The story and plot are complete dogshit, steelblood plot was a bit interesting but but they decided to shove it aside as side stories, so instead of some interesting we got the same generic OP MC bs with a genderbent twist as its ""unique"" thing.

The info about the highlanders was way more interesting but we got none of that, instead all we know is that they are a bunch of assholes, who treat humans (our MC's side) like literal slaves.

One thing good about this anime its animation and art style, not an animation expert but the character movements looked smooth and nicely shaded. Better than most isekai's and otome villainesses genre animes.  Its peobably better than blue lock whose manga sales competes with the likes of JJK and CSM.

What magical girl show takes place in the most realistic (not necessarily dark) setting?,What to Watch?,"I'm looking for a magical girl show where the location or the setting feels the most realistic and natural. Something reminiscent of our real world. So something very close to our world, and the magical girl ability and the monsters that emerge say from the evil sorceress truly feel like anomalies. 

So far, the magical girls shows I've seen (that I'm willing to count as something I properly watched) are Sailor Moon, Cutie Honey 79 and Shin, the Fate/Kaleid Series, the first 10 or so episodes of Cardcaptor Sakura, Re:Creators (kinda magical girls show), this season's gushing over magical girls, first 2 episodes of Madoka, Magical Girl Site, and Tokyo Mew Mew. 

I find it hard to explain the vibe I'm looking for. 

Cardcaptor Sakura so far is I'd say the most grounded one, but there are still scenes that imo are a bit unrealistic. One of them is quite early on, there was a infiltration of a museum, and the way it was handled got me thinking ""no, you definitely would've been caught.""

I'm not really against the magical girl transformations, it's magic after all, but I want those scenes to be treated as if they truly are special things that you won't see anywhere else in this world.

Cutie Honey (the ones I've seen at least) are very cartoony, one being a 70s show an Shin taking place in a dystopian future. Also Cutie honey is a lot different from the 'precure' type magical girl shows we get today.

Sailor Moon takes place in a realistic-ish setting, but a lot of things are simplified and exaggerated (since obvi the demographic is for little girls). 

Fate/Kaleid is another one I'd consider super grounded, but the magical girl element doesn't feel special and unique since rather than being the main point of magic in that world, it's more of a subcategory of magecraft.

Gushing over magical girls kind of has what I'm looking for. The magical girls are treated like celebrities and they somewhat give explanations as to why they aren't instantly recognized, but.... y'know-

Re:Creators work great here, they go through great lengths to keep the world as grounded as possible, but it's less about a magical girl show more than it is anime in general. The magical girl also came from an anime (reverse-isekai) rather than a girl from the 'real world' getting magical girl powers.

The last time I asked, I've heard people suggest shows like magical girl site, but I don't really think it's what I'm looking for. The setting isn't this bubbly fantasy world, but it's really just taken to the other extreme with dark horror that feels like shock value for the sake of it. I'm looking for a realistic location and character reactions, but that doesn't necessarily mean I want it to be grimdark and cruel.

Imagine if a magical girl does the pose and she cringes because she's self aware. Or maybe she faces a scary monster that actually ends up hurting people and (being a little girl) she freezes and cries at the sight. She goes home and cries to her parents if her parents are present at all. There's a lot of fantasy flashy stuff, but the characters themselves feel 'real.' This is really hard to explain because magical girl shows usually do take place in the 'real world', but the vibe feels somewhat tilted towards a direction I can't explain. 

I guess the 'take' I'm going for is something similar to what Grimgar was for Isekai. It took that concept and played it incredibly grounded with how it would actually be if people got sent into a fantasy world. 

If not that, then this season's Bravern. The world outside of Bravern is played as serious as it get get, but Bravern itself feels so out of place. Imagine a 'Bravern' being the magical girl essence in an otherwise normal 'real world.'

I know what I'm looking for beats the purpose and demographic for magical girl shows in general since it's geared towards little girls, but I am very curious if a show like that does exist.

Edit:

I'm fine with silly and comedic light hearted moments, as long as it isn't anything that feels too exaggerated and slapstick-y.

This is more of a perosnal preference, but please no sci-fi elements like Mechs. This doesn't really break the main point of realistic settings, but more so me not bring a fan of blending magical and sci-fi.

Anime about a blonde girl that can talk to and helps animals from early 2000s or 90s maybe?,Help,"I remember quite a while ago watching an anime series about a blonde girl, who would help animals in the human world that would sometimes be peoples pets etc and then to fully help the animals problems she’d go to an animal world where there was just talking animals etc. I remember one episode there was a nerdy kid in the girls class who played games and had a pet bird, the boys name was Mario I distinctly remember that because in the dub (because I remember watching it in English) he says something along the lines of “yes like the video game character” when asked about his name. I also remember an episode about her helping a dolphin at the beach. There was also another episode where she came back from the animal world and I think she ending up in/near a bush, and then she saw her family out of nowhere? Any ideas?

Trying to find a song (maybe from Banana fish),Help,"So this might be a bit of a stretch but does anyone remember a while ago on tiktok (I can’t remember if it was trending or i just got a lot of videos like it on my fyp), there was a trend of using images from banana fish in a slideshow and on each thing it would say something like “me when I wake up in the morning”, “me when I get home” “me when I see my dad” “me and my dad because we are the biggest haters” etc (it didn’t have to be that in specifics but it was something like that.) but in every one of those videos there was a song in the background and I can’t for the life of me remember what it was and I’ve been trying to find one of those slideshows to see if I can find the song but I can’t find any.

Most sickeningly toxic anime(s) you've seen?,Discussion,"I'm talking about anime that you see as blatantly preaching and condoning some really toxic messages or values that would be frowned upon outside of the story.

I'll start:

- **Darling in the Franxx**: ""if you see a loved one obviously getting abused by a spouse who even claims to not care if her partner DIES as a result, then unless the person explicitly asks for your assistance, DON'T YOU DARE take any action to help him, even if his life is at stake, otherwise, you're just a selfish asshole who only cares about making yourself feel better. After all, if the victim doesn't open up about it, then obviously his situation is as healthy as it can get, right? What? Stockholm syndrome? Don't be stupid. There's clearly no such thing! (sorry. This section turned into a bit of a rant) 

- **Your Lie in April**: well, I think by now, it's been brought to light just how HORRIBLY toxic its handling of abuse and trauma is in regards to parental and romantic relationships.

- **Don't Toy with me miss Nagatoro**, at least that's the impression that the 1st episode gives. I'm still yet to see the rest

- **Most of Pokémon's first season**, condoning narcissistsic bullying towards those less skilled than you are, victim blaming, pokémon abuse, heck, even justifying murdering opponent's pokémon just because you can. Thank God they stopped with this vibe from season 4 downwards.

- **Rising of the shield hero S1**, though it was only the part where Naofumi was accused of somehow being made out to be at fault for the abuse and slander he's received, and just because he doesn't want to go out of his way to ""Win over"" the people who off their own judgement decided to frame, insult and harass him just for existing

And those were the examples I could think of. How about you? Please bear in mind that this topic is mostly YMMV and that you shouldn't be an asshole to others just because you don't agree.",False,anime,1706351933.0,1ac84k0

One Piece: The main culprit and my favorite series - I'm too lazy to type out every flaw, but the episode of sabo was labeled S15 a long time ago .... WHY???

What do you is the correct age gap for a couple if one of them is reincarnated,Discussion,"Like if you are writing a story where 25 something guy get reincarnated as baby, would you write his girlfriend his reincarnated age or would you consider his past age or their sum or something else because it feels like it will be weird either way for either mc or his gf

Mc has to date someone

lifespan in isekai world is same as on earth, so mc can't have a girlfriend after he is 1000 years old

Usually it's just to skip the cliffhangers but I've also noticed that the time spent waiting for the part 2 is usually when I end up just dropping the show. For example, the show 'Ron Komonohashi's Forbidden deductions' had a few of these and I ended up not finishing it because of that reason.

Edit:
I completed the series and I felt like I wasted my time on such an absurd show. I understand that they somehow created a pseudoclosure for Shinji's character by addressing his existential dread and creating a sense of meaning by the end. But the series is plagued by endless issues.

For starters, why go all the way in creating a dystopian post apocalyptic world only to address the existential dread of a not so likeable protagonist.

Mobile Suit Gundam SEED: Paving the way for a new generation,Writing,"Yup, we're here. With the 2 previous AU series not releasing to the west till the late 2010’s (ya, that freaking long), it would've been a good 10 years till we get another Alternate take of the series. But this time, it's taking more ques from the original Universal Century and creating the Cosmic Era, the most divisive Gundam Universe in the franchise. You either think it's a creative way to reintroduce the series or you hate it for existing. I'm in neither camp, as despite not being a big fan of the CE, I thought the anime itself was pretty decent. Kinda funny that this came out 2 years after I was born, and yet didn't watch it until summer of 2020 during a road trip I was on with my family after my highschool graduation. I have quite a few points I can make on this show (both positive & negative) and make some comparisons to some other anime in the meantime. So for anyone who hates reading walls of texts, you might wanna exit now. Otherwise, buckle up, cuz I got a lot to say

* Plot:
   * In the year Cosmic Era 71, a group from the colony of Heliopolis must endeavor on a journey to Earth away from ZAFT (Zodiac Alliance of Freedom Treaty). But as 4 of the 5 Earth Alliance Gundams were stolen from the enemy, Coordinator Kira Yamato must defend his friends with the Strike Gundam from his own kind and even his childhood friend Athran Zala. However, little do they know that the Earth Alliance may be more dangerous than ZAFT.
   * Did the 1st half sound familiar? While obviously not beat for beat, this anime really takes a lot of ques from the original Gundam series. A crew of lower rank soldiers and civilians running a prototype warship while a civilian is only one capable of using the Gundam, while on the run from space fascists, ain't it quite the same. Although I will dock points for reusing the plot, I can at least say that ZAFT stealing 4 of the 5 Gundams does add a lot of stakes to the series. With Kira being the only who can pilot the Gundam, it makes the fights more tense as he stands between the Archangel living or dying.
   * The plot also has themes of hatred towards “the other” affects us. We see throughout the series how hate can affect us; like how damaged the relationship between Kira & Athrun became, the Earth Alliance nuking a colony because of the threat of the Coordinators, or both EA & ZAFT doing heinous war crimes to get rid of one another. It shows how hatred blinds us and makes us do stupid things. So while the series has some holes here and there, on the whole it's just ok. Nothing too special and it's just your standard Gundam series carried by the mechanical designs and Mecha action. Though the pacing could be a little better.
* Character:
   * I think this is where most of the criticisms come from when talking about the show's divisive reputation, the cast. This is them most K-Drama/Telenovela you'll see in a Gundam series.
   * Let's just talk about the one person you MC hating otakus hate the most, Kira Yamato. It's no secret that he's on a lot of people's shit list of “bad anime protagonists”, but I think the hate is overblown out of proportion. While one my 1st watch, I thought I might hate the guy, but I was just indifferent and thought he was pretty decent. He just starts off as your typical computer nerd who hangs out with his friends. But is pushed into battle after seeing the destruction of his home. I honestly think the problem is that we don't even go that deep into his character, especially certain parts in the last half.
      * But I'll start with stuff I like, I just like that he's just a selfless guy. There's a lot of things he doesn't want to do, but does anyway because he cares about his friends that much. I also like that he frees Lacus without a second thought just because it was the right thing to do. I also like that there are times where he does regret killing some pilots. He also has a great rivalry with his older best friend, but I'll get to that eventually.
      * As for stuff I don't really like about, while not bugging the shit out of me, it is still understandable why he's not viewed in the best light. For starters he acts like a total dick to his friend when he finds out that he had an affair with Flay, and instead of recognizing what was wrong, he just brushes it off and never brings it up again. Also the reveal that he's the “Ultimate Coordinator” feels half baked and doesn't even go anywhere. But let's address the Gundanium elephant in the room, his Luna titanium plot armor people love to bitch about. But I'll save that for an eventual Destiny review. Another problem is that the anime is that it speed-run through his development. Went from fighting out of desperation to non-lethally destroying mobile suits. I'm just gonna say watch Unicorn to see how this development is done better. Banagher is just better than written Kira. Hell, Kirito from Sword Art Online is a better written version of Kira.
   * Now let's get to the opposite side of the spectrum, Athrun Zala. He's honestly a pretty good character in his own right, as he actually has a character arc. He starts off as someone who fully believes in ZAFT and what they're doing is completely justified after what the Earth Alliance has done. But he eventually learns that ZAFT aren't that much better after meeting Cagali and joins her & everyone else to stop both the Alliance & ZAFT. It's a great character arc for someone on the other side. I also like that he has a hard time fighting his best friend and tries his best to convince him to join him, which makes his rivalry with him more interesting. But like Kira, there's a few things I'm not a fan of. The big one is like another ZAFT pilot, he isn't really called out for brutally murdering a pilot in an aircraft by any of the members of the Archangel and is barely confronted by the consequences of his actions. I also find it insane that he's more flexible & fast than either the pilots or just the typical ground soldiers. I'm not sure if the others went through the same training or part of those coordinator genes, but damn, that white boy can move.
   * As for the love interests, they were okay. Lacus Clyne and Cagalli Yula Athha are alright. Lacus is your typical gullible princess who thinks everyone should get along, but doesn't understand it's not that simple. But then just steals weapons of mass destruction. I… I'm not gonna question it, she does her. But in all seriousness, she has a similar problem as Kira, that this would've worked if it was actually developed but it just isn't. Again, watch Unicorn since Audrey is a better version of this.
   * Cagalli has a little more depth to her as she does have a pretty interesting character arc. She wants to get involved in the war since her home country remains neutral and is rightfully upset when she learns her country is working for the Earth Alliance to develop mobile suits. She has a good character arc. However, when she learns that Kira was her twin brother, nothing really changes either. The anime treat it like a massive reveal, but their relationship doesn't really change all that much.
   * And there's the relationships between the 4, okay… there's a lot, and I mean ALOT to unpack. Let's start with the big one, Kira & Lacus. I think they're a fine couple since they share the same beliefs. They believe that the best way to stop the fighting is through non lethal means. It's definitely better than his relationship with a certain bitch I'll get to later. But honestly Athrun x Cagalli are the better couple, as they have way more depth to them. They both agree that the Earth Alliance must be stopped, but they challenge each other's viewpoints. Athrun has her think about how her people's neutrality might not work in the long run. As Cagalli makes him consider that, despite their pretty justified intentions, ZAFT might be just as bad as the Alliance. It's a good dynamic, and shows how much they deserve each other.
   * I've already mentioned Kira and Cagalli’s relationship, so I'll cut to Athrun and Lacus. Despite people memeing on it, I felt that these 2 didn't really belong with each other. Although they do care about one another, their beliefs are too different. While they do believe in both ZAFT & the Coordinators, Lacus believes that both Coordinators & Naturals could get along while Athrun (at least in the beginning) strictly believes that all Naturals are the cause of the war. So all adultery jokes aside, Lacus x Athrun wouldn't really work, since its an arranged marriage set up by their parents.
   * So as we move onto the other characters of the 3 factions, you'll notice the paragraphs I made explaining the main 4. If the numerous marketing placed on these 4 haven't made it obvious, it goes to show that they had more focus in the whole series compared to the other characters. However, there were still some good apples on both sides. So let's start with the ones on the Earth Alliance.
   * Starting with the main three; Murrue Ramius, Mu La Flaga, & Natarle Badgiruel. These 3 were easily the best of the whole Archangel crew.
      * Murrue follows a similar role as Bright from the original Gundam series, where she's an underranked soldier who's forced to take on a commanding role and lead under trained soldiers as well as civilians to safety. You can see her growing into the role with the amount of the struggles that came with the territory.
      * Next there's Mu La Flaga, need I say more. He's your typical hotshot pilot and all the better for it. And he can put his money where his mouth is, as like another badass pilot without plot armor (in this anime at least), he can go toe to toe with a whole ass mobile suit with a spaceship and a jet. Now that's how to assert dominance. However, he might need to work on his wording as he can easily piss off some people without meaning too. As for his relationship with Murrue, it's easily the best. Not too different from Hal x Carol from DC. A hotshot pilot & his sexy boss who swore off dating other pilots until they got close together. And as they grow close together, one of them makes the ultimate sacrifice to protect the one they love. That last part may be done to death nowadays, but I think it works better here since we genuinely spent time with these 2.
      * And then there's Natarle Badgiruel who's a really underrated character if we're being honest. She serves perfectly as a foil to Murrue as her tactics are pretty brutal and highlights how fucked up the Earth Alliance can believe. Hell, she straight up suggested to use Kira's parents as hostages to force to him into piloting the damn Gundam. She perfectly reflects how Murrue might have turned out if she didn't stick to her morals.
   * But as go down the EA list, we realize that we're starting to hit the bottom of the barrel. I'll start with Kira's buddies; Sai Argyle,Miriallia Haw, and Tolle Koenig. Sai Argyle is basically Futoshi but NTD’d harder and Tolle is Miriallia’s BF till he gets shielded in the face. Ya… Miriallia is the only one with anything to do. And its highlighted in that scene in the sick bay. She almost killed a ZAFT soldier in the hospital out of revenge for Tolle and nearly ended up like the majority of the Earth Alliance we see. That YT I've mentioned in the beginning already covered how much of a good scene that was. It's just a damn shame she doesn't do anything else for the whole series.
   * And now we're scraping at the bottom of the barrel, the bigots of Electronic Arts. Let's start off with proto Myne, Flay Alster. I hate this bitch. She's easily the most hated girl of seed and for good reason. For starters, she's a fucking xenophobic who hates coordinators, to the point where she threatened Lacus. She also guilt trips Kira with a child. Oh, I'm not done yet. Did I mention that she cheated on her fiance for Kira just to manipulate him? The lion, the witch, and the audacity of this bitch. I deadass felt nothing but joy when she got brutally murdered.
   * On to Blue Cosmos, Muruta Azrau is just a rich racist prick who tortures 3 kids (Shani, Orga, & Clotho) into fighting. He definitely got what he deserves. and the rest of the Alliance are the same
   * I'll just cut to ZAFT. Mainly the Ra Le Creuset team. 1st of all, let's discuss the masked menace himself, Ra Le Creuset. The man is just delightfully cunning as he has a good read on people. I also do like how he progressively goes insane over time. And then totally freaks the fuck out the moment his true face is revealed. Towards the end, they don't even hide how much he wants to kill everybody. It's so hilariously insane that I can't take him seriously. As for tradition for every Char Clone, he's gotta have a sexy voice. And thankful Mark Oliver delivered as he went hard AF. Rent was due, and this lad was paid.
   * As for his war mongering members of marry men, I can't really say many positive things about them. Outside Athrun who I've already gone into deep detail with, barely any of the Rau team are likable. The only attempt they had was with Dearka Elsman. He's basically a chill guy with an actual character arc. When he got captured by the Archangel, it highlights how heated the rivalry between the Naturals & Coordinators are. He makes fun of the Naturals until meeting them and nearly gets killed by them. It's a wake up call for him and shows him that Coordinators aren't that different from Naturals in both positive & negative ways.
   * Yzak Joule & Nicole Amalfi are easily the worst. Yzak is just a straight up asshole and the anime doesn't even try to hide it. They tried making into a loveable jerk, but completely forget about the loveable parts. Once he shot that transport with INNOCENT CIVILIANS, that was when I grew a deep hatred for him. What's worst it's that he never learns that the craft he shot had civilians. As for Nicole, I also don't like him, though not as much and for different reasons. The only personality trait is that he likes playing the piano. Other than that, he's more invisible than his own Gundam. People mourned Nicole’s death, but I ain't one of those people because not only he had nothing I can latch onto personality wise, his death is more on him because he changed head on towards without a second thought. People blame Kira, but honestly I would've done the same thing as a flight or fight response.
   * I'm not going waste time with the other characters from either ZAFT or Orb. All you need to know is; Patrick Zala has a superiority complex because his wifey died, Uzumi Nara Athha blows himself up, the Astray sisters (Asagi, Juri, & Mayura) are basically the Shrike team, Ledonir is Cagalli's dark skinned butler (interpret that as you will), and Andrew Waltfeld is Rambal Ral if he survived & had plot armor.
   * Here's the TL;DR, the characters are very, VERY divisive. One minute you can tolerate them or in the evening think they're cool characters, the next you think they're annoying or are the worst person known to man. Who you love and/or hate is up to you, but I've said my piece (writing about the characters are always the hardest part of these reviews).
* World building:
   * Since this is a new take on the Universal Century under the name “Cosmic Era”, surely they would have a unique form of world building….. right? Well….sure…. but not by a lot. There's there's things about this world that are pretty unique to this universe, with other things that are basically meaningless in the grand scheme of things.
   * For starters, why do space colonies look like hourglasses? Like, how does anyone live in thes? Also do you know that NewTypes exist in this universe along with fucking SPACE WHALES? Does this add anything significant to the SEED lore?.....Nope, it's so meaningless that you can take these out and it wouldn't make a difference.
   * But in the case of the Coordinators, I can at least say they the Cosmic Era a little interesting ... for the most part. They don't have the mystique or sense of wonder of the NewTypes from the original Gundam series, but they still have their quirks. Ever seen the movie Gattaca, well it's basically that but with anime hairstyles. The concept of babies genetically modified before birth is an interesting concept and it adds a lot of commentary about the ethics of genetic modification. There's an episode that shows us how the Coordinators came to be and how violently Naturals (normal human beings) reacted. It led to various hate riots, protests against each other, and the infamous Junius seven bombing that led to the Bloody Valentine Wars. Although not 1 to 1, it kinda reflects what happened in our world for many years with various races. People always fear things they don't understand. It was pretty brutal, and it luckily didn't end with one side dropping power blocking drills.
   * Speaking of which, the N-Jammers are kinda overkill. They basically block all forms of nuclear energy making nukes and power plants useless. Basically anti-Hiroshima the whole earth. It's one thing to make nukes useless, it's another to make towns that rely on nuclear energy to power their homes. They do introduce N-Jammer Cancellers, that nullify said Jammers, a jammer that jam jammer that jams nuclear energy. But instead of using them to fix their energy crisis, they're used for Gundams and nukes.
   * Which leads to my next point, both the Earth Alliance and ZAFT are the most evil factions in all of Gundam, I'm only half joking. These 2 sides does so much fucked up shit that it's really hard to root for any of them. The Earth Alliance bombs space colonies, uses children as experiments, and is funded by a hate group called Blue Cosmos. As for ZAFT, they caused various nuclear power outages, attacked colonies, and ravaged towns that don't even support the Earth Alliance. Did mention that they a fucking space laser on each side. Seeing the Cyclops system and GENESIS (Gamma Emission by Nuclear Explosion Stimulate Inducing System) popping people into a bloody mess like balloons is something that's always messed up to see. One side runned by xenophobic space bigots, while the other are runned by genetically modified assholes with a superiority complex that can't even reproduce. You have to be fucked up to join any of these sides.
   * The only side that you actually want to root for in this anime is Orb. The Orb Union are the ones who don't have the urge to commit war crimes since they stay neutral throughout the whole series until the last few episodes after Uzumi blew himself up along with Orb, where Cagalli joins up with the 3 ships alliance. So these factions follow the same problem as Zeta and AWGX, the 2 opposing forces are so fucked in the head with their evil beliefs that you obviously want to root for the less evil ones. I know Gundam's well known for ambiguous “no side is fully good or evil”, but EA, ZAFT, and Orb are so obviously one part of the spectrum that it removes the ambiguity of the morals of these guys.
   * One last thing I've found interesting is how eerily similar this is with Code Geass. Hell, Code Geass is more of a copy of Seed than it is with any other Gundam series. Let's run them down;
      * A war started because of racism
      * One side having the upper hand because of having giant robots 1st
      * said Mecha always getting hijacked
      * 2 childhood friends turned rivals because of differing ideals
      * one of them have inhuman like reflexes
      * a gulibe pink haired princess who may or may not die
      * supernatural abilities involving eyes
      * a tsundere turned Mecha pilot
      * the tsundere being trapped on an island with the enemy
      * a horny racist thot
      * a figure in power that just so happens to be the MC’s dad who's also a dick
      * even the same character designer
   * The people working on Code Geass were clearly taking inspirations from SEED. I find it weird that people often compare it to Sword Art Online and not Code Geass since the comparisons are right there (and this is coming from someone who saw and liked all three). Either way, they're honestly not a whole lot for the Cosmic Era. It's basically just a reimagining of the Universe Century, but with not much of the charm of said universe. It's kinda hard to see why Japan has a hard on for this universe right next to the Universal Century.
* Mobile Suits:
   * Now it's time for the best part about these reviews (if you guys read em), the mobile suits. Starting off with the Gundams, let me tell you, Bandai pulled out all the stops with these Gundam designs. There's a total of 11 Gundams, ELEVEN, DOUBLE DIGITS. And I'm not even counting variants, MSVs, or other mobile suits. No joke, we haven't gotten THIS MANY Gundams since G Gundam. We have under a dozen mobile suits to cover, so let's get to it.
   * However, 3 things bug me about the mobile suits.
   * 1.) The beam effects always feel weak with those spammy green beam colors. They should've stuck with the usual pink & yellow designs when it came to the beam colors. The red beam designs look good though
   * 2.) While I do like the idea of the Phase Shift armor being made for anti-ballistic defense, I don't like that it changes the color of the mobile suit. Mecha that changes colors is one of my many Mecha pet peeves as it feels unnecessary and it could've just been painted its iconic colors
   * And 3.) despite being the GTA of Gundam, it's weird that it's only Gundams and the ones doing the hijackings are the coordinators. Apparently they're the only ones that can use mobile suits. I'm also not a fan of this idea because I'm so used to mobile suits in general being able to be used by anyone. And it sucks that the rules change depending on the series. Sometimes you can be an average Joe and use a mobile suit, sometimes you can't. Sometimes you have to be a NewType and sometimes you gotta get surgery to use one. And I hate how some of the characters get all cheeky and go “um obviously you can't hijack mobile suits. Duh, this is real life. And in real life, we fight giant robots with tanks and bazookas”. Like it's all bullshit anyways. The military don't use bipedal machines yet, so just play it straight. I typically prefer shows where anything works. In the original Universal Century, you can hijack a mobile suit in a million different ways, making the stories more interesting. The Turn A can be used by anyone, making it more deadly. And yet people get scared shitless when a MS shows up with I shit you not, a machine gun and a small ass sword. You shouldn't be acting big with a loadout like that. With that being said, I still think these designs are pretty good. Starting with the basic boy itself, the Strike Gundam.
      * Although I'm not a big fan of the french fries attena, the base design is pretty good. By itself it's a by the numbers machine with nothing more than a pair of Igelstellung CIWS guns (good luck pronouncing that) and a pair of Armor Schneider combat knives. But once it gets the Striker Packs, that's when things get interesting.
      * The Aile Striker Pack gives it a beam rifle, 2x beam sabers, a shield, and a backpack that grants it high mobility in both the atmosphere and in space.
      * The Sword Striker Pack has the Schwert Gewehr Anti-Ship sword that makes the Dragon Slayer look like a toothpick, the Panzer Eiser rocket anchor for some grappling hook action, and the Midas Messer Beam Boomerang for some Crikey action mate (insert Australian joke here), good for getting up and personal.
      * The Launcher Striker Pack has the Agni Beam Cannon and Combo weapons pod (a mini gun & 2 cannons), just hang back & shoot.
      * And finally there's the Multiple Assault Striker Pack that takes all 3 packs and turn the Strike into the Perfect Strike. Basically the good ol’ all-in-one Gundam to get the job done.
      * There's also Strike Rouge that's just a pink Strike that supports the Pink Ribbons. It can use a bazooka BTW. This is just one Gundam and we're just getting started.
   * Next we got the 4 stolen Gundams.
      * Starting off with the Duel Gundam, an all round machine made for any situation with your standard load out (vulcans, shields, a pair of beam sabers, and a beam rifle with a grenade launcher). But things get interesting once it gets the Assault Shroud, which not only gives it extra armor, but also the cannon/missile combo that's found in a lot of Mecha (especially Gundam).
      * Next we got the Buster Gundam made exclusively for medium to long range attacks. With its missile pods, A Gun launcher with ballistic weapons, and long beam rifle for any situation from a distance. And if he needs some extra firepower, combine the 2 and use a super sniper or super shotgun for some more dakka. However, its only downside is that it doesn't have any melee weapons to defend itself from up close attacks. Though since its main role is long range support, I'll give it a pass.
      * Next we got the Blitz Gundam, a stealthy suit given to the wrong pilot. With a Trikeros shield with some wonderful toys (a beam rifle, a beam saber, & darts) and the Piercer Lock “Gleipner” for some grabby grabby action from a distance. It can turn invisible with the Mirage Collide, giving it an advantage in stealth (hence why I'm more mad that it was given to a stupid ass pianist who got his dumbass shish kabobed by a fucking sword with a beam edge. Why didn't he turn invisible to stop the Strike? Is he stupid?).
      * And finally we have Aegis Gundam, and it's a transformable Gundam that um…..who wants Takoyaki. In MS mode, it has the usual vulcans, 4x beam sabers with one saber on each limb, and a beam rifle. You know, the usual stuff any mobile suit can have. And there's the Mobile Armor mode, and sweet Christ what was the designer on when it came to the transformation. God damn, is this thing a squid girl cuz that beam kuchi can squirt (I mean it is called the Scylla so……). All I can say is that Athrun can bring out the most out of the damn thing.
   * Before I move onto the other Gundams and eventually the mobile suits, let's talk about the team’s dynamic of the Rau Creuset team. Compared to the previous Gundam team, I say it's a massive improvement in terms of roles. The Aegis & Blitz are great for close combat, the Buster is good for long range support, and the duel is a good mix of close & long range combat with its equipment. My only complaint is the pilots. Outside of Athrun and Dearka, use their machines pretty effectively, Yzak & Nicole just don't really fit these suits. Especially with the former acting like a total count the whole time. Nicole used the Blitz fine at first to sneak into a base, and then after that he just forgets that he can turn invisible 90% of the time.
   * Next up are the 3 Gundams used by EA’s pet Coordinators.
      * The Calamity is a Gundam that's a bitch cuz bitches love cannons. Aside from the aforementioned cannons, it has a chest cannon, a shield with 2x beam cannons, and a bazooka. So basically an artillery MS.
      * Next is the Aqua boy, the Forbidden Gundam. CIWS guns, machine guns, 2 rail guns, a beam cannon, and a scythe, this loadout makes this thing the terror of the deep end.
      * Finally, there's the Raider Gundam with a MA mode. For starters it has a dual beam rifle onits shield, the Zorn beam cannon on its mouth, and the Mjornar mace for bonking action. As for its MA mode, while a little weird, still looks better than that mechanical squid monstrosity. And it has a better loadout too; 2x shoulder machine guns, a nose machine gun, and a short range plasma cannon that can also act as a short beam blade. Funny looking, but effective.
   * I won't say much about the team dynamic since these machines came in last minute and we didn't have the time to flesh out the dynamic since they're too busy doing their jobs.
   * On to the final 3 Gundams, made by ZAFT but 2 of 3 of them got stolen by Lacus.
      * Starting off with the main boy himself, the Freedom Gundam. This thing ain't iconic for no reason by aesthetics alone, as it has an angelic figure to inspire a sense of hope towards it's allies. It's definitely in the wings, which aren't just for show you know. It has the High-Mobility Aerial Tactics mode (Hi-MAT for short), which grants the thing great maneuverability in the air and in space. As for its load out, it has the goodies. It has the usual stuff like a beam rifle, 2x beam sabers, 2x Picus CIWS guns, and an anti-beam shield while also having 2x Plasma shoulder cannons and 2x hip rail guns (we need more mobile suits with hip range weapons). It also has the Multi Lock-on system, which is an aim-bot that locks onto multiple targets at once. There's also the Full-Burst mode that shoots all the listed weapons all at once. This thing is an Angel with a Shotgun (just replace shotgun with a beam rifle).
      * Moving onto the Justice Gundam, and this is easily my favorite Gundam in the show. The horn sensor may look silly AF, but I'll take it over the fucking squid. As for its weapons, this this is also packed. There's the usual; Sagittus CIWS guns, a beam rifle, a shield, and 2 beam sabers that have double beam blades. As for its extra weapons, it has Australian fever with its 2x beam boomerangs and its backpack known as the Fatum-00 (no relation to the 00) that serves as a standing glider with some extra goodies as well. We got some machine guns, turrets, and 2x beam cannons. This Gundam also has the Multi Lock-on system.
   * Before I move onto the last Gundam, let's talk about the dynamic of the former two. These 2 were made to fight together as a duel, and it's done really well. The Freedom was made for long range to support the Justice while said unit was made for close combat. These 2 units really complement each other really well. Thau is mainly because Kira & Athrun are already pretty close to one another in spite of their disagreeing stances in the anime.
      * And finally, there's the Providence Gundam, the final boss. This thing was made to be evil, and it has the stuff to back up its dastardly look outside of some simple Vulcans; a chunky beam rifle, a left arm with a beam shield, beam saber, & 2x beam guns, and how can I forget this show’s answer to bits. With a total of 11 Dragoons (3x big & 8x small), this thing can beam spam for days.
   * Now let's move onto the Other mobile suits before I lose you guys’ attention span. Starting off with the 1st ones with war MS, ZAFT.
      * We got the Ginn, a by the numbers unit with a mohawk. It has the usual goodies; a machine gun and a ballistic sword. Sometimes it has some rockets.
      * There's the Long Range Reconnaissance type, with a radome & a sniper rifle.
      * The WASP type for some fun Unda da seas, with missiles and beam cannons to fight alongside the ugly ass aquatic MSs, the G00hN & Zn0.
      * And then there's the Tactical Air Reconnaissance Type with its close beam rifle and machine. It also has the Mirage Collide System that's hopefully used better than how Nicole used it.
      * That last one paved the way for another mobile suit ZAFT made, the Dinn. It's the same, but with a Shotgun this time, no Mirage Collide, and sexier wings.
      * Next up, our mechanical doggos, the BuCUE & LaGOWE. The BuCUE has a beam saber in it's mouth instead of a stick and can use either a pair of cannons or missiles. Not a lot, but enough for our K-9 of death. The LaGOWE is similar to the BuCUE but with claws and the twin beam cannon. It's also Buffalo sauce orange for Mr. Waltfeld.
      * The CGUE is a high mobility version of the Ginn with the same stuff.
      * The GuAIZ has hip anchors and Claws bub. And finally the GuAIZ has the goodies of both the Freedom and Justice.
   * If you thought Zeon had a lot of mobile suits, ZAFT went like “hold my beer”.
   * As for the Earth Alliance, they only have like one mobile suit, the Strike Dagger. A mass production version of the Strike Gundam. Being a toned down version of the Strike, all it has are vulcans, a shield, a yellow beam saber, and a beam rifle w/ a grenade launcher. Unfortunately it can't equip Striker Packs. There’s another one that could, along with other variants based on the other 4 Gundams. But since they’re MSV and didn’t appear in the anime, I won’t count them. A+ for effort though.
   * Moving onto Orb, all they have is the M1 Astray. And before you ask, no it's not the Astray Red Frame as those are vastly different units. As for this one, all it has are a pair of vulcans, a shield, 2x beam sabers, and a beam rifle. Another good unit that can keep up with the Ginn and even the GuAIZ & CGUE to some extent. A shame they got the Gun-EZ treatment (if you know, you know).
   * When I said Bandai was Cooking in this series with the mobile suits, I wasn't joking. Hell, these are the most popular HG kits right next to the UC kits. Bland beam effects aside & reused animation aside, the fight scenes are also pretty good too. So basically, if you don't like the writing, the Mecha fights can serve as monkey brain entertaining.
* Verdict:
   * It's honestly tough to say whether or not this anime is a good entry in the franchise. On one hand it has good commentary on hate groups (Xenophobia, Racism, and even Homophobia depending on how you look at it), decent character drama, voice acting that ain't half bad, top tier mechanical designs, and interesting action scenes. On the other hand, the story is a little hard to keep up with, some characters being hard to handle, and needless plot armor, this anime has its fair share of problems. And if it weren't for the commentary on prejudice it would be a pretty by the numbers Gundam anime.
   * Looking at it now I can only imagine the impact it had on western fans. Keep in mind, both After War Gundam X & Turn A didn't get the same treatment, so Western Gundam fans must've waited nearly a decade for more AU stuff from the franchise.

An anime where a character snaps,What to Watch?,"Today, while engrossed in an episode of MHA, witnessing Midoriya channel his anger for a triumphant victory, I couldn't help but feel a bit fatigued by the common trope of the 'angry protagonist prevails.' You know the drill: typical action shonen scenario where the hero taps into rage to protect his friends and save the day. Well, I wanna try something different.

Basicallly the title, I want suggestions of an anime where a character (not necessarly the mc) just snaps, and when I say snap, I mean they really lose it, crossing a line that contradicts their morals and principles. (I don't mind if it's gore or dark, aamof I would love if that was the case)

Looking for Mecha Anime Suggestions,Help,"So I know I will probably get flamed for this. But im looking for some good mecha anime, that isnt like 100 years old. I know Gundam, Votoms ect. are amazing ect. But Im just not a fan of old cartoon graphics. Just really not my bag. So looking for some Good anime that have some amazing fight scenes and arent just endless drama. Tired of finding a Mecha anime and its 20 episodes of the mc just crying, bitching, and moaning. Just being all emo about shit. I just want good solid action man. Feels like the last good mecha I actually watched was Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans. Hated the ending, but man watching all the fights and seeing  Barbatos  getting upgraded and becoming just a monster. Was just amazing. 

So yea not trying to bag on older/drama based ones. Just looking for some good new fresh action mechas. Thanks",False,anime,1706318529.0,1abyqxf
Sometimes it’s fascinating how certain titles will be kept in Japanese,Discussion,"I mean I don’t know why I had to bring it up, but I guess it’s because lately I was looking back at how titles like Mushoku Tensei are still kept in their Japanese title as I guess my point is that I want to understand the way that translations work when it comes to bringing Anime over to English.




Like why sometimes titles like again Mushoku Tensei or say YuYu Hakusho have their titles kept in Japanese whenever they’re brought over to the USA as lately I didn’t understand why distributors will do that kind of practice instead of say translating the whole title.",False,anime,1706318410.0,1abypf2

Anime/manga like JJK that isn't Demon Slayer or Chainsaw Man?,What to Watch?,"I just caught up to the JJK manga, and I really enjoyed it. I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much back when the first season came out. I really hated Gojo because he felt like such a Mary Sue, but I recently decided to get back into it, and the second season (+ the manga) definitely made Gojo a lot more tolerable to me. The only issue is that now I really want something similar, but most of the anime people I know (which admittedly isn't a ton - most of my friends don't even know I watch anime) have only been able to recommend either demon slayer or CSM. 

Before I proceed, I want to highlight that I, in no way, shape or form, mean to insult either of these series. They're well liked for a reason, and I acknowledge that objectively speaking, they're good. They're just not what I'm looking for at this time.
 
I've seen quite a bit of both - read further into the CSM manga, and I didn't really enjoy them. Something about Demon Slayer just seemed a tad too childish for me, and I found the protagonist boring. I'm also really big on characterization and character interaction, and I don't feel like I got nearly enough of that with Demon Slayer. CSM was a bit more enjoyable for me, but the crude dark humor and reliance on gore just came across as overly edgy to me. 

With that in mind, are there any other series you could recommend? I don't know if this helps, but other animes I enjoyed were Fullmetal Alchemist, Samurai Champloo, and Cowboy Bebop. I know character interaction wasn't that big an element in cowboy bebop, but I still loved it nonetheless. One of my favorite makeup products is called Space Cowboy (the glitter by Urban Decay its sooo pretty) and I literally only bought it because of this show.",False,anime,1706316239.0,1abxxwx

Mizuko kuyō in Anime,Help,"Hello,

 I am doing research for my bachelor's thesis and preparation for a short presentation on the topic of Mizuko kuyō (水子供養) (Buddhist memorial service ceremony for unborn children) and I am wondering if by chance someone has come across a mention or a scene regarding this ritual in some anime.

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
RadSuit thought my Abyssbringer prompts would *ever* be faked~
>I honestly thought the screenshot of the day for this episode was a shitpost Photoshop.  *Wow.*



Sky postex exactly the sort of post you don't want to see right before your finale 
> **Serial Experiments First-Timer, subbed**

- [](#lost)


Weedwacker hasn't seen enough inflation art to never tempt the feeder fanbase. 
>> I mentioned this in a comment in one of the other discussion posts but I really don't think there's a single scene in the show where we see Lain *actually* consuming food.  Maybe there's a scene of her drinking water.  Even in the dinner scenes with her family she's just stirring her soup not eating.

Does this hint at anything about what kind of existence she has intentionally and reinforce Eiri's insistence that Lain's physical existence is merely a hologram?  Or is this just a coincidence/accident that they never showed her eating and i'm reading into this too much?


Silcaria noticed that they kinda ran out of content towards the end. 
>  *Alright guys. We're 10 mimutes short on what we're suppose to deliver to the network so let's fill one of the episodes with a recap but let's not make it too obvious.* The recap.

zoospor got some affirmations from our software≠consciousness chats! 
>honestly it feels really good to read another comment that mentions the parallel the show makes between software and human consciousness. i've never seen anyone else put it into words before and i believe that's the core of the entire show! i noticed the cord reaching across alice's room also, definitely funny but i love that attention to detail -- the thing can't run on batteries! and i would definitely be triggered if there was no cord. helps to remind that everything is connected!

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!"" 


Xtsim wins yet again with a dapper Abyssbringer prompt!

> Abyss: After all that she's been through on the wired, Lain just does what she feels like, cause it does not matter anymore. She can be in a dragon form, isekai hero form, or alien. Like online, we can create our own furry avatars on a zoom meeting for work, Lain's alien form is like an avatar and it is so normal now, from profile pics to workplace zoom meetings. I do not see anything wrong with this.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      

Alfie had one of the better explanations for Lain having an affinity with aliens. 

>  # 🏱︎☼︎⚐︎💣︎🏱︎❄︎

> The alien represents otherness. Lain isn't from this world. She no longer feels as though she belongs among ""normal"" people. Nearly the same thing as Umika in Stardust Telepath. Simultaneously, Lain is developing a stronger connection to the Wired which is functionally a different world

If I think Seirei no Moribito is the best thing ever made what else should I watch?,What to Watch?,"I haven't watched anime in over a decade but recently decided to watch avatar and legend of korra and that left me wanting more, I don't care to watch cartoons so I turned to anime and after some research I was recommended kingdom, demon slayer and seirei no moribito (guardian of the spirit)

Since I read kingdom early on is kinda ass I went with demon slayer but watched the first scene in the snow and decided the art style wasn't for me and the main little dude gave me naruto screaming for the sake of screaming vibes, and that's not what I'm looking for

I don't have any specific genre I'm looking for because my knowledge of anime is 0. I've only watched naruto, some bleach, some dragon ball and death note. Recently I also watched One punch man and vinland saga

Since apparently no one liked Moribito because all I see is like 5 threads online and 3 reviews on youtube, and people saying the anime is slow paced (????) I can only asssume I'm a superior specimen with refined taste

But really, I'm looking for something with decent realistic art style (no anime titties or hentai voices, or characters that look cartoonish to compensate for lack of personality), world building and character development (by this I don't mean something like Canute being a big clueless pussy his entire life and suddenly hears one speech and unlocks omega brain, I like vinland saga but some things feels very childish in the way they are portraid)

So yeah, if you read my whole post you might think I'm dumb or an ass hole, which you're probably right, but help me out still. If nothing comes up I'll probably research more Nahoko Uheashi's work or try to find more stuff made by Moribito's studio

And if you haven't yet, watch the anime and ask everyone you know to buy the books so I don't have to learn japanese just to read all volumes, thanks",False,anime,1706296428.0,1abqa7z

Not sure if I'd necessarily call [Kaiba's soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rwp31GeENEA) all that weird or experimental, but it does sound rather unusual and otherworldly.

Are there any harem genre anime that include physically disabled love interests?,Discussion,"I thought about this after watching the 100 girlfriends anime.

I went looking, and I was able to find a visual novel, katawa shoujo, and a few romances like a silent voice.

My short review of Cardcaptor Sakura.,Discussion,"# Overview

This is something I've wanted to do for awhile now after I watched Cardcaptor Sakura, and my god let me just say I absoultely loved this series, and it's sequel clear card.

# Premise

For those who may not know the series is about a 10 year old girl named Sakura Kimamoto who one day opens a book in her father's basement that releases these magical artificts called Clow Cards, and awakens a small little beast named Kero who makes Sakura into a ""Cardcaptor"" to collet all of the Clow Cards and bring them back to the book.

# Characters

I really love the characters of this series, even ones who seem bad at first can grow on you.

Let's start with Sakura herself. What I like about her is that she acts her age. Desptie being burden with this heavy responsiblty you are constantly reminded that she is still a child, and she gets scared, and confused by the situations she's put in. In the beginning she doesn't want to be a Cardcaptor, but as the series progresses she does learn to overcome her fears, and doubts. I also love her relationship with her brother because it feels like they are actually siblings where it's clear that they annoy each other, but also love each other greatly.

Next we have Tomoyo who is the only one of Sakura's friends to know about her secret. While it may seem over the top when she tries to get Sakura to where her dresses, but she's really supportive, and a wonderful friend.

Sharonn Li came off as a jerk at first, but as the series progressed he became a nicer, a really good friend to Sakura. It was also cute when he got jealous of other boys paying attention to Sakura.

The same can be said for Mei Ling who again started off as mean, but is now one of Sakura's best friends. I espesaiclly love her in Clear Card where she gives Sakura advice

I think all the other characters are wonderful two espiescially Sakura's other friends from school.

# Animation

I think the animaton is great. It was a 90s anime so it looks old timey, but still it's very good.

# Overall

Overall I'm really glad I watched this series, and I can't wait for more of Clear Card to come out hopefully sometime this year.

What’s an anime you have a love-hate relationship with?,Discussion,"There’s been heaps of questions about what’s “objectively the best/peak” or “what’s overrated/mid/bad”, so I thought it’d be nice to strike a balance between the two, having an anime which has aspects that you like and aspects you dislike at the same time (or love and hate)

For me, a big one would be JJK. It’s dope as fk, the anime fights are awesome, but sometimes it makes me wanna pull my hair out. I’m sure manga readers would agree with me lol",False,anime,1706263731.0,1abf1lt

Real World Novels That Appear In Anime,Help,"Salutations All!  

Have you ever been watching an Anime, and notice a character reading a book? Then, the camera zooms in to the book cover so we as the audience can read the actual title of said book?  

The most recent anime I can think of where this happened is Gundam: Witch From Mercury in which Elan was reading A World of Will and Representation by Arthur Schopenhauer. This was shown fairly early, and if you looked the book up, it gave a pretty good hint about Elan's character. I will refrain from going much more into detail to avoid spoilers.

Why I hate Adonis from The Kingdoms of Ruin but like Eren Yeager from Attack on Titan,Discussion," If there's a recent anime Character that I can say I dislike it's Adonis from The Kingdoms of Ruin a young man who sets out to kill all of humanity after the death of his witch mentor Chole. This is simlar to Eren's goal of wipping out all of humanity as well. Yet dare I say I still like Eren very much though.

Now this may come off as crazy, and some of you are wondering How I can like Eren, but hate Adonis. Espescially when you consider Eren has done much worse then Adonis. Well it has to do with their personalites.

Eren was wracked with killed and remorse over what he was doing, so much so that he kept his eyes closed during the entire Rumbling, and don't forget about his apology to a little boy he saves only to kill later.

Another reason I prefer Eren is his reason for doing The Rumbling. Eren sat and listend as the entire world went into agreement that Paradis Island had to be destroyed, and everyone on the Island need to die. Eren did all of it to protect his people, his family so that they could have a future.

Adonis on the other hand is a jerk to everyone, and doesn't care who anyone is, even to Dorako the girl who tries to make him see that revenge is wrong, but everytime she speaks he basically just tells her to shut up.

Second his reason is just out of petiness and hurt. Sure Adonis has ever right to kill the king of Redia, and possibly some Knights. But wanting to wipe out all of Humainty who had nothing to do with Chole's death is pure selfishness.

Oh also if you think about Chole's death is basically Adonis fault in the first place, because he tried to do some dumb shit, and got himself captured only for Chole to try and save him then get captured herself. So really Adonis only has himself to blame for Chole's death.

Also it's safe to say he doesn't even care about Chole and just wants to kill people, because he acknowledges that Chole wouldn't want him to seek revenge, but he still does it anyways

So yeah that's why I think Eren Yeager is better then Adonis",False,anime,1706233238.0,1ab6glu

PSA: What you need to know to watch Meiji Gekken 1874,Writing,"A newly streaming show on Crunchyroll called Meiji Gekken 1874 has some of the biggest splits of opinion I've seen between my Japanese anime-watching friends, and the opinions I can see on MAL or other places where non-Japanese anime fans gather.

Meiji Gekken has thus far gotten a COLD reception on MAL, sporting a putrid 6.48 score, and yet some of my Japanese friends (particularly history buffs) are pretty psyched about this show through the first 3 episodes.  The action scenes are well choreographed, the animation quality is solid, and the VA has been solid.

The reason for the split isn't hard to figure out... the show is very clearly written for a Japanese audience that's already familiar with late 19th-century Japanese history and doesn't hold your hand AT ALL, making it rather impenetrable to many viewers unfamiliar with the background.

This show is a cool late 19th-century period piece that covers some of Japan's dramatic moments in its history, so for those who want to get to know Japanese culture and history, I think this is a  really great show.  But to understand what's going on, you need some basic knowledge about 19th-century Japanese history that any Japanese viewer would be expected to know (and the show assumes that you know).

1. Japan was ruled by a stable relatively decentralized feudal de facto monarchy called the Shogunate.  The shoguns put Samuari on the top of society, who were lived off of pensions/salaries that each family held by hereditary right.  This system kept the peace for 250 years and led to a period of prosperity and economic growth, but growing dissatisfaction from merchants and peasants.
2. The Emperor continued to rule as the sovereign of Japan but in name only, as a symbolic figure.  The Emperor and the court weild little practical political power.|
3. Japan lived in isolation during this period, only trading with the outside world through a few ports.  All foreigners were barred from entering Japan except in these limited areas, and Japaense people were prohibited from leaving Japan.
4. In 1852 and 1855, Commodore Perry leads the Perry expedition, forcing Japan to open up its borders for trade and commerce at literal cannon point.  Britain, France, and numerous other Western nations follow, signing a series of ""Unequal treaties"" that forced unfavorable exchange rates on Japanese merchants.  Many Japanese are upset, and rally around the Emperor who was opposed to opening up Japan.
5. 2 regional lords of the Satsuma and Choshu provinces, also called the ""Sa-cho"" (from the first 2 letters of eacH) form an alliance that leads a successful coalition to persuade the Shogun to give up his power without a fight to the emperor.  For various political reasons, the Shogun agrees.  This is called the **Meiji Restoration,** as it restored the Emperor to a position of political power.
6. Some samurai who served under the Shogun refuse to accept this surrender that they see as a betrayal of their values, and continue to fight.  This leads to a civil war called the **Boshin War**.  The Imperial Forces are well funded and equipped with western rifles and cannons, and the Ex-Shogun forces (while also armed with guns and cannon, but fewer) are driven north.  Many surrender.
7. The last province to surrender to Imperial Government forces is Aizu Province, who fought to the bitter end.  The MC of Meiji Gekken is from Aizu.
8. Because of this bitter resistance to imperial rule, people from Aizu faced frequent discrimination for years after the Boshin War as the most disloyal citizens of the Emperor.
9. With the new Imperial government seated, and adopting Western-style governance and rule, the Samurai class begin to grow discontent as the Imperial government begin consider removing their special privileges from the Shogunate era, like their pensions and exclusive right to wear status symbols (katanas).  They even are no longer called Samurai but are given the title ""Shizoku.""  Meanwhile the central government views even such remaining privileges as being incompatible with Western Style governance that they want to adopt.
10. The Meiji Era is a period of rapid change as Japan sees itself as backward and begin aggressively importing both Western technology and Western culture and values.

In the opening scene, the protagonist  Shizuma is a samurai from Aizu and is fighting for the Shogunate forces in the Boshin War.  They are engaged in the last, futile resistance against the Imperial Army.  

Also know that most of the high government officials (Prime Minister Okubo and Minister of the Right Iwakura for example) are historical figures from history. As a shorthand, you can think people in western clothing in government are pro-reformist/pro-equality, those wearing kimonos are either lower class or anti-reform/Pro-Samurai (shizoku) privileges.

To anyone who has an interest in Japanese history and culture, I think this is a good show worth watching!

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
Kwokinator is a dirty based lolicon... Lain, get the men in black on him!! 
>""Myu-Myu claims that younger is better for girls. Please list three reasons why she's wrong!! We are all Hag lovers!!"" - sorry, lonely loli loli kami kourin, I can't hear you over the sounds of Ui BEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAM!!!



Specs64z is kinda right... The ""reflection"" period in Lain is often just ""check out these weird visuals.""
> I'm noticing that this anime doesn't really dedicate any time to reflect on things. Arguably that's part of the appeal, but it also leads to a number of ""sure that happened"" moments.


mgedmin apparently has thought that Lain's passiveness towards food was just that her mums cooking was minging. 
>> How would a hologram eat?

>IS THAT WHY WE ALWAYS SAW LAIN STIRRING HER SOUP WITH THE SPOON BUT NEVER SAW HER ACTUALLY PUT ANY FOOD IN HER MOUTH?

>But anyway, ""hologram"" is a fancy word, I don't think there are actual hologram projectors installed in her house, school, and everywhere in the city where Lain goes.  It's been established before that Lain can manipulate people's memories, through the 8 kHz resonance, so my theory is that whenever people think they see Lain, it's actually their memory being edited in real-time.


AlphaNull's little lore dump analysis of the episode!! 
> [I see two sides of this scene:](https://i.imgur.com/EX4as3Q.png)
   >""This is all real"" interpretation: Eiri manipulated everyone's memories (and perception) to strip away any connection Lain has to the physical world in order to encourage her to abandon her physical body
 > ""This is all psychosis"" interpretation: This scene is metaphorical. Lain is experiencing a paranoid delusion that she has nothing left and has been abandonded even by her closest friend. She states that she [""always tried not to say anything weird""](https://i.imgur.com/7lRISfX.png) because she always felt like this was a possibility, given her condition, but after one of her alters did said something horrible it doesn't matter how careful Bear Lain was. This is made all the worse because the person that she relied on the most, Arisu, wasn't there for her in that critical moment so Lain's mind leaped to ""she abandoned me on purpose"" hence [""Arisu"" saying this.](https://i.imgur.com/hG1D0dT.png)

Vaadwaur says [""daisuki!!""](https://youtu.be/RwG-Kg_JDdk?si=iibo4Hy5lPj0HbDC) 
>And now onto Vaad's special corner: What version of love did the anime use? Lain's father/the professors says 'daisuki', like a reasonable parent would. Karl also says 'daisuke'...which raises questions but there are acceptable reasons for that. Good ol' 'God', unfortunately, use 'ai shiteiru', which is what yanderes and other psychopaths say. He also wants Lain to 'aishita' back, which I think is almost as negative. Caveat here: The Japanese may not have been as hostile to Ai this far back, but then again Mai-HiME seems to have been...

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      

JustAnswerAQuestion posted their full comment with info loredumps clearing up the discussions from yesterday. 

>  Some comments on yesterday's comments.

>The exposition was in 3 groups, flavor (UFOs), thematic (development of web and connectivity), and plot (Protocol 7).  You might think only the last one needed to be there.

>The plot critical points were Eri, Protocol 7, and the connecting of human minds to each other, and to the wired, via the resonant cavity between the Earth and the Ionosphere.  This connection allows any manifest existence in the weird to connect to people's minds.  This technomagic had a natural predecessor: marine mammals.

>Thematically, this connectivity was presaged by early networking attempts.  Machine networking, yes, but also pure information networking, like hypertext.

>Human psi, I am unsure on this point. The collective unconcious is theorized, but here, it is real. Via the Shumann resonance, which has always existed, people could touch each other's minds.  However, the psi in the show may also be a means of changing reality. Not sure.

>On that aspect, what is reality?  What is truth?  What is history?  The UFO story tells us that Truth and History are malleable.  So much more so, now, with people's mnids and the Wired linked in a bidirectional manner, much more intensely than through weak, natural psi.

>But this is not presented out of left field.  Eiri is presented as the last in a line people of who changed the world, starting with Vannevar Bush and MJ-12, the mysticism of Lilly and the hypertext of Ted Nelson, and the global wireless satellite network of Xanadu.

>Power lines make for fantastic ELF antennas. That's how he coupled the Wired to the global electromagnetic field. The power lines are everywhere.

>As for Taro and, in my first pass of the thread, somebody felt his speech was an indictment of ""One Truth"" but I read it as the opposite.  People lust after the One Truth.  Wouldn't you work for the Knights if they offered such a thing?

>Eiri's frog face at the end of yesterday's episode reminds me of [the Master Control Program.](https://www.google.com/search?q=tron+mcp&tbm=isch) 

And lastly from Vaadwaur

>I will only add that I think Eiri is trying to insert his 'truth' in at the end to retroactively make it a reality, like he becomes 'God' because he always was 'God' and history took a while to figure it out.

**Questions of the Day:**	

1) How close to Earth would you estimate the moon would have to be to cast such a well-defined shadow over such a large area for such a long period of time?

2) Is it any real shock that Pride's true form is a literal baby?

Bonus) I swear to fucking shit, I am so fucking over this series twisting reality around Ed to let him avoid having to kill that I'm on the verge of giving myself an ulcer.

Pokemon vs Digimon: Which had the better dub?,Discussion,"In 1998 Pokemon was dubbed by 4kids entertainment and it was a hit in America at the time on the Kids WB network. While the dub has been the target of criticism and controversy throughout its history due to censorship and changes to the story . Despite these criticisms, most of the English dub is well-received, and has many viewers, some even preferring it over the original Japanese anime. Saban Entertainment and Fox Kids  in 1999 was try to find a show that could rival Pokemon and Kids WB in the ratings and the answer to that was Digimon. Digimon while revived some edits, they’re not as extreme as Pokemon and it was a huge success because of that.

The /r/anime Sweet 16 Fanart Contest!,Announcement,"Hello everyone! As part of our Sweet 16/9 mill/Awards Extravaganza, we wanted to bring back an old favorite. The past fanart contests produced incredible works of art, such as /u/Earth2Mars's ""[CURIOUS](https://i.imgur.com/sE74IpQ.jpg)"", /u/manip21's tremendous ""[Gate of Karma](https://i.imgur.com/ZP3e2yH.jpg)"" (which remains @RedditChan's background to this day), and a [submission from /u/SrGrafo themselves](https://v.redd.it/chtpl6xezd531). I don't know how many of you know that even our thumbnails were created as the result of a contest, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5ak6p9/snoo_and_thumbnail_update/) (or to the left of any post).

With this long and great history of wonderful fanart being generated, we thought what better way to use [Reddit funding](https://files.catbox.moe/1vwh05.png) than to spark another round of inspiration and creativity?

#Rules and Guidelines

Your task is essentially the same as the [10th Anniversary Reddit-chan Fanart Contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/7raa3g/10th_anniversary_redditchan_fanart_contest/). Create fanart of (or including) our very own [Reddit-chan](https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/AQ_47wQPWDOEuP0LohFeFYpoa3fdLcqWrgIxDYvU_PI.png). You have free reign here, however, creativity will get you far. Here are a few more guidelines to follow.

* All fanart submitted must be your own work.
* All fanart submitted must depict our mascot [Reddit-chan](https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/AQ_47wQPWDOEuP0LohFeFYpoa3fdLcqWrgIxDYvU_PI.png) in a substantial way. You may include other anime characters, as long as they are not your OC.
* Only light NSFW material is allowed and must be tagged in the submission comment.
* Tracing is not allowed in any form.
* Digital and hand drawn fanart is allowed (No basic photoshop edits are allowed).
* Minimalistic/vector art is allowed, but cannot be traced
* No meme related work is allowed.


The **top three scorers** will receive the following prizes.

#Prizes

**1st Place - $200 Crunchyroll gift certificate**

**2nd Place - $100 Crunchyroll gift certificate**

**3rd Place - $50 Crunchyroll gift certificate**

***
Please note that these aren't just for Crunchyroll's streaming service (which would be a horrible ""prize""), they apply to most of [Crunchyroll's online store](https://store.crunchyroll.com/). Especially now after they've taken over RightStuf (RIP), you can have your pick of any number of manga, anime vinyl, and of course figures (if I won, I'd be eyeing [this one](https://store.crunchyroll.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-crunchyroll-master-catalog/default/dweb8c9891/rightstuf/4934054037759_figure-power-chainsaw-man-artfx-j-primary.jpg) 👀).

#Submission Details

We are doing something a little special for this contest. We know that fanart has had a bit of an up and down history with the subreddit, so we are relaxing the submission rules for fanart—only for fanart contest submissions.

**You may post your fanart contest submission as an image/link post, as long as it is appropriately flaired.**

Your submission must be in the form of a reddit post to /r/anime between now and the deadline of **March 25th, 2024**. Please ensure your contest entry post is flaired as ""Fanart Contest"". This is a new flair created for the purposes of this contest. Your post must abide by our fanart guidelines [as seen in our rules here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/rules#wiki_oc_fanart) **Contest entries will be allowed to made as an image post.** All spoiler-heavy images must be properly tagged according to our spoiler policy. You can only make one submission to the contest. If for whatever reason you submit multiple fanart pieces to the subreddit for the contest, only your first submission will be counted.

**Link your submission as a reply to the stickied comment below in this thread.** If you do not your submission will not be counted.

Your must have been created expressly for the purpose of this contest. You may not reuse your own content that was made before the announcement of this contest—self-plagiarism is plagiarism!

#Selection and Eligibility

The top three prize-winning entries will be selected by a panel of judges. They will be evaluating for difficulty of execution and degree of creativity. You may look at the submissions (and winners) of the [last Reddit-chan fanart contest for inspiration.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/7raa3g/10th_anniversary_redditchan_fanart_contest/dsvbidz/)

Now for a bit of disappointing news. Since these prizes are funded through Reddit, there are certain regional restrictions. Namely, in order to be eligible for prizes, you must be a legal resident of **the United States of America, the United Kingdom, or Canada (excluding Quebec)**. You must also meet /r/anime's new account restrictions, namely **be an account older than 8 days and have more than 10 karma**. You must not be banned from /r/anime (duh!) and must be in good standing with the community.

***

That's it! We thank everyone in advanced for participating. I know this stuff *isn't easy*, and the hard work that goes into each and every one of these pieces is both evident and appreciated. The last art contests we've had have produced some of my absolute favorite drawings, and I'm sure more of those will be created here.

I want to find an anime movie I watched a few years back,Help,"I forgot most of it but I'm wondering if anyone would be able to help find it again. I saw it on Youtube, it was in Chinese,  It's set in a modern cyberpunk ish like place and the main character and his friends fight a lot of stuff. They probably had an intense fight near the end of the movie, and then it leads to the main character falling into a white space where there are thousands and thousands of pages. 
He finds out that those pages document the movie, breaking the fourth wall, and he then falls in the blank space to his death. 
It then cuts to a scene of his friends, where the guy dressed head to toe in blue is supporting the girl who i remember was dressed in purple.
I'm not sure if it was a billibilli creation or an actual movie, but hopefully it can shed a bit of light.",False,anime,1706197953.0,19fcfoz

Looking for this old anime...,Help,"Edit: FOUND IT! [OP of the anime in question ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-v7e5tg2YbQ)

This is hard for me to explain as my memory fails me and I was very young at the time but here goes, back when I was a kid (I'm 23 now) in my country the TV aired very few anime in our main cartoons channel, I remember very faintly them having this ""detective?"" anime, I remember more little bits (more like the melody) from the ending theme.

I say detective but it just felt mysterious and the the characters also sounded/looked very young like they were in school still and the anime style was very old too like... sailor moon kinda style..?

Also one of the main characters had blonde/light hair, I know this isn't much but if anyone could help me find this anime I would appreciate it so much, almost starting to believe it's not real but I still have the ending theme on my mind so I thought I'd ask for help and hopefully find an answer :')

Thank you.",False,anime,1706185477.0,19f85c0
When do you watch a Remake over the Original?,Discussion,"I'm at the age where many of the classics I've seen (or missed) from my own childhood are getting modernized revisits, and I wanted to know where people fall on watching the more modern or ""classic"" take. To me it seems that some of these shows are so ingrained as classics that watching the more modern version is like watching the Robocop Reboot; probably fine but definitely a pale imitation of something really special at the time. At the same time, there are some of these shows that definitely suffer from a lot of nostalgia bias, or are getting remakes that are being made with a lot of love and respect for the source material. Best example I can think of is when past 90's OVA's got a ""proper"" adaptation in the 10's, specifically Jojo's and Hunter X Hunter, and the later shows are definitely classics in their own right.

Off the top of my head I can think of:

* Urusei Yatsura
* Sailor Moon Crystal
* Rurouni Kenshin
* Shaman King
* Kino's Journey (to a lesser extent)
* Spice & Wolf (soon)
* One Piece (coming up)

So, what do you usually do? Do you go back and explore the older show first? Do you generally default to the newer version? Do you somehow have the time for both? Or does it depend on a show by show basis, and if so, which shows do you think the new version is better than the old? Also, any examples that I missed?

In particular, I'm curious about what people think of new Urusei Yatsura and new Sailor Moon, because they are definitely old enough where the oldness can throw some newer people off, and they seem like they're very thoughtful adaptations but the older shows definitely have older qualities that the new ones are missing. Finally, I think the worst thing for me personally is if Spice & Wolf old and new end up being very good in significantly different ways, because I don't have the free time to justify trying to watch the same story twice.",False,anime,1706184881.0,19f7z6p

86 Part 2 is mostly terrible,Discussion,"PS: ""Please don't post LN spoilers""

Edit: Few corrections made in the post - Frederica is a kid, changed mystery to lore.

My review (thoughts) for both parts as follows:

**86 Part 1 - Rating - 9**This anime is not clear when it comes to combat presentation like you can't see what is happening clearly on screen many times, but communicates the message/emotions it wants to convey really well. High production quality & Amazing Animation. So depressing. Damn, why did they have to do that at the end?! 😭

**86 Part 2 - Rating 4**First of all, they made the first part ending meaningless by bring 86 back. Fine! At least we are happy they are alive!

In regards to this season, First two episodes were actually good, but it became a slog afterward. It was so boring/annoying to the point that I started skimming through one of the episodes to reach the climax. The main culprit is the mech fighting - it is still terrible. It is not a seamless presentation, and it is hard to see what is happening on the screen most of the time. It is just the weird angles and camera cuts coupled with the english sub. You have to put more effort to understand, because of these issues. I'm not going to put effort in watching it, if I'm not getting rewards for it. Because the plot is terrible as well.

The lore in part 2 isn't worth exploring either. Frederica is annoying AF. Also, why should we care about a character about whom we don't know anything about? Just because she is a kid? Don't remind me about Frederica's ghost!

The only reason I was watching was for the major to meet the 86. Got what I wanted at long last in the last two episodes. But still take an L. Terrible season with a satisfying ending made the score go from 3 to 4.

*Sorry, I'm not a native English speaker, so forgive me for any grammatical errors. These are just my thoughts that I noted down while watching the show.*

What do you think? Did you have similar feelings? or did you enjoy it more?

Goblin slayer question - is there only the simulcast version of season 2?,Help,"Hello! 

Just wonder if there’s an uncut version of goblin slayer season two? I only see simulcast available on Funimation unlike season one with has uncut and simulcast, and I find it’s just a much less impactful or really good show without any of the gore or horror scenes like from the first season. 

Weird thing to want I know but I liked the show for it being dark and it’s just not! I’m about halfway through though so just let me know if it’s about to get dark again and I’m just a bit early lol I wanted to ask now before having to rewatch the entire season as an uncut version 

Is it on another streaming program or will it just come out later? I dont think I saw the option on Crunchyroll but maybe I just missed it of can’t see it since I don’t have a subscription to it

In search of an anime I dreamed of,Help,"I had a dream today - a dream that I already had before. I dreamt about an anime, where the dream felt like watching a whole episode of it. It was so vivid that I can't dismiss it as just a fraction of my imagination, even though I am confident in my ability to imagine things. I'm making this post in the hope that someone recognizes the anime and can provide its name.

In the dream, the main character wore an alien suit with a mask that allowed him to communicate with it. It felt like an own character. I'm not sure about his motive for fighting, but it seemed like aliens had attacked planet Earth, and he fought them using the abilities of the suit he possessed.

He was searching for information, expressing his determination by saying something like, ""If they did all this just for fun, I'm going to kill them."" I recall a powerful scene where he walked down a passageway, repeatedly uttering ""revenge, revenge, revenge"" (""Fukushu"" in Japanese).

Simultaneously, there were side characters in a hospital, lying inside a capsule-like structure and undergoing testing. Some, if not all of them, seemed to be aliens who sided with humans or, at least, with the main character.

One female character from this group reached the roof after the test and called some kind of air vehicle that could fly. While she was trying to board it, a government official, possibly also female, destroyed the vehicle. She couldn't leave, and the government official intended to keep her under close watch. This angered the female character so much that she used her mental abilities to destroy the entire hospital, killing everyone in it (the animations were intense in that scene 😂). The government official panicked and immediately apologized for her behavior. She asked if she could restore the hospital to normal, offering the female character the freedom to leave without interference.

The female side character restored the hospital to normal, showcasing her power to manipulate time, and left in her vehicle, expressing a desire to see the main character with the mask.

That is my dream. Like I mentioned, it felt like I watched a whole episode of that show in Japanese dub, with exceptionally good animations and an old art style. It seems too clear and well-constructed to be just a dream, especially since my dreams tend to be somewhat awkward and random, which this one wasn't. Also, it wasn't the first time I dreamt exactly of this. Does anyone recognize this anime, perhaps?",False,anime,1706161928.0,19f2d90

What should I watch after Death Note,What to Watch?,"# Overview

Now, I wasn't satisfied with what I found on other posts, none of the answers include why that show specifically. That's why I have to tell you a few things I am not looking for, why I liked DN and what I am not looking for

&#x200B;

# Why I liked Death Note

I liked DN because:

1. Pacing - The story is pretty fast but not too fast, in the first episode you can see Light picking up the DN, reading some of the rules and testing the notebook, a fast strong start that tells you a lot about Light and the DN while not being overwhelming, in the second episode you already know his intention, if you don't know that in ep1 already and learn that Light is a very careful person and is already hiding the notebook very securely.
2. The characters - The characters are great, I loved how Light, L and Near are so intelligent. I liked how Light was half evil half good, having a good intention of killing the criminals and had a sense of justice.
3. The storytelling - I loved how this anime told it's story playing what the characters are thinking out loud
4. The genre - I like how it was a lot about human psychology and that it was a thriller
5. The music - I did not like the second half of the show's theme music. But seriously L's theme and the starting theme and ending theme of the first half of the show are masterpieces in my opinion.
6. Not much action - I liked how it didn't have much action
7. Plot-twists - A lot of plot-twists, for example Light joining the investigation.
8. The story - The story is very good.

# What I am not looking for

1. Long anime - I am not looking for anime longer then 50 episodes.
2. Anime with lots of action - I do not like action, I tried code geass and I did not like how much action there was
3. Slow paced anime - Anime with a really slow pacing
4. Too fastly paced anime - I do not want it to be overwhelming

# What I am looking for

Which anime do you think is in everyone's top 10?,Discussion,"To contrast with the other thread, do you think there are certain anime which is in everyone's top 10 (assuming that they have watched it)?    
 
Rules of thumbs:    
1. Let's agree to judge the ANIME not the MANGA. So if an anime is unfinished, judge it based off the unfinished product. If the manga is better, still judge based on the anime.   
2. If an anime spans multiple seasons, try to count it all as one long product. For example, don't separate out Monogatari series into different parts.     
3. If an anime has different versions (FMA), judge it based on its most popular version (FMA Brotherhood).      
4. By ""everyone"", I'm taking a Western centric POV. So for example, I'm not expecting Detective Conan even though it's huge in Japan.

It is my pleasure to become part of the reddit community. I had an inquiry regarding an anime that I saw a short reel about on Instagram but did not catch the name and really think it would be a good watch.

The entity proceeds to cause his death multiple times in increasingly different ways.

90s/00s animé name? - Dark alley scene,Help,"Hello, my first post in here so I'll try to be brief. The only thing I remember about this animé is this scene where the main character is in an alley or street and kills this other guy or maybe even two guys. Bear in mind I was a kid and many years have passed so the details are a bit blurry. Anyway, what may give you the solution is that the character that offs the other/s was a cyborg with human head but full metal body, and his body, when he was killing in this scene at least, had a lot of guns. I mean his shoulders had guns, his belly, legs, arms, not like Inspector Gadget with little robot arms holding these guns, we could only see the barrel of the guns on the body of the character and the muzzle flash for each shot. Needless to say it was a gruesome death and that's why it traumatised me. Now I'd like to see it again but I don't know the name of the animé and won't know until I see that scene again.

Help me get back into anime!,What to Watch?,"**Don't hesitate to drop recommendations even if they don't exactly match anything on this post. Maybe I could use a game changer.**

A time ago I was reallllly into anime. But I mostly dropped it 3 or 4 years ago to focus more on other things. Now I've been considering getting back into it, I hear there's a lot of new amazing titles out - and I'm sure a plethora of old ones that I'd be really into that I've missed.

I can be a little picky, at least I was - maybe my tastes have opened up more now. A big problem I had with anime was how perverted or extremelyyyy generically tropey they could be. Understand that this is pretty... Ubiquitous in most anime tho, so maybe disregard that preference if the anime is good enough. I liked anime that subverted conventional tropes or expectations with how bizarre they could get, and I love it when anime blends some sort of psychological aspect into the mix or is trying to give the viewer a message.

**Some of my favorites:** *FLCL, Hellsing Ultimate, Gurren Lagann, Welcome to the N.H.K!, Sonny Boy,* and *The End of Evangelion*. I'd put *Steins;Gate* as a favorite definitely... But I haven't seen the anime, I played the visual novel.

**Others that are nearly favorites:** *Welcome to Dr. Irabu's Office, Violet Evergarden, Nichijou,  Now And Then Here And There, Berserk* (1997)*, Made in Abyss* (Yes! I need to watch season 2!), *Gankutsuo: The Count of Monte Cristo,* and *Promare*.

It is also infamously long and notoriously hard to get into (Good luck getting your friends to watch low quality animation by late 70s standards if they won't even watch high quality animation by 90s standards). Still its influence is undeniable and it still maintains a solid fanbase who will live and die by the franchise.

I find given the nature of the franchise, most people online fall into one of two camps: they haven't seen Gundam or they really REALLY love Gundam. However, in my own experience I've found that like any franchise, Gundam isn't without its highs and lows, both of which get smoothed over with a simple dicotemy like that. So I want to open up the floor to more nuanced takes and see just what the general masses think of the franchise that launched a thousand gunpla.

So, have you watched any *Mobile Suit Gundam* series? If so, how much and what do you like and/or dislike the most about the franchise? What are the best and worst Gundam entries? Why is *MS IGLOO* actually kinda based? What do you think is the biggest factor holding people back from watching Gundam? If you haven't yet hopped into Gundam, what's been the biggest thing holding you back? ",False,anime,1706134905.0,19et5bt

Man Yoshiyuki Tomino does not hold back when it comes to melancholy,Discussion,"Just saying that as I got Aura Battler Dunbine a couple of months ago, and holy cow does it get dark fast as after at least 14 episodes, the tone changes hard as without giving too much away, I will just say that things don’t go too well for him when he returns to Japan.




True, the show might have some odd parts in it such as the character names, or how people in Byston Wells can understand a man from Japan who only speaks in Japanese, but man has the show been really engaging to watch as it has that standard Tomino style where things go well at first, but then the plot goes hectic real fast as ABD does not hesitate to show how a man can be misunderstood within his own country.




I don’t know if I can gush about the show here as I’ve seen about 20 episodes so far, but I just wanted to share my appreciation of it as while I do miss when Tomino used to make anime, I have heard that there have been directors in the modern anime scene that can replicate his show (no pun intended) no mercy style as I like anime series that can catch people off guard with a huge tone shift as sometimes there are shows that start off fairly peaceful, but then get dark all of a sudden as those shows are fascinating to me personally.",False,anime,1706134111.0,19estph

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
3blah believes narration clips aren't based
>I covered some of it already.  An uncharitable reading might be that it's to pad out some of the runtime.  I don't
think it's a spoiler to say that we'll come back around to some of this stuff, but not necessarily all of it -- you
could say that about just about anything we've seen so far.  Maybe it's a way to tell the certain people that are
watching ""We get you, man. Isn't this deep?""  Maybe it's a different way to do an infodump; we've had a number of
these already, and doing it this way makes it feel like we are researching these things on the internet along with Lain.


Mgedmin is being affected by the curse of the Wired... Is he gonna get Mika'd? 
> Also, what happened to the ED visuals?  My GNOME desktop suddenly lost the ability to update the picture on the external screen and it's now saying ""to Be continued"", forever.  Playing with the display cable didn't help, I had to power-cycle the monitor itself.  Ominous.


SMSmith was blown away with our new reveals!! And our cute little grey bro! 
>Holy shit, the green/red stripe shirt finally showed up and it’s an alien???  Wait did this whole episode just describe how the Wired was created and the humming is the 8Hz frequency connecting everyone?? 🤯


Kwokinator is waiting for the aliens to take us in and welcome us to the greater universe. 
> Did the extended Area 51 chats mean anything to you or do you still just see it as the funneh alien UFO zone? - both can be possible. Aliens have always existed, it's just now that Lain has evolved enough for aliens to detect and acknowledge

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      

Weedwacker legit blew me away... I know I shouldn't be saying that as host, but I never had aliens on my radar. 

>  The Roswell UFO incident and Majestic 12 are referenced to imply that The Wired originated from alien technology or influence, by bringing up Vannevar Bush's connection to Majestic 12.
Vannevar Bush was a real (and very interesting, and unrelated to George Bush) scientist who did lots of work involving microfilm, and theorized that technological advances would allow a ""Memex"" device that could store and access all information, and that such technology would change how we think.  Presaging and inspiring many advances in computing.  Basically every guy who was working on Hypertext systems in the next few decades said they were inspired by him.

Recommend me an Anime that would legitimately make tear up.,What to Watch?,"Something that takes its characters seriously. None of that forced crap where a character dies in 20 seconds that I knew for all of 20 minutes and had no emotional attachment to. I’ve watched Clannad, but that did nothing for me. It was too anime tropy for me. Good story, but found moments to be kinda cringey. 

I want something like Avatar the Last Airbender. A scene akin to Zuko apologizing to his uncle for betraying him. We’ve been with those characters, know them, are attached to them. They’re beautifully written and acted. That moment truly tugged at my heartstrings and got a legitimate, earned tear out of me.",False,anime,1706129837.0,19er2sa
Berserk aka STRAIGHT TESTOSTERONE SIMULATOR,Writing,"One of my favorite mangas is Berserk created by Kentaro Miura a man who never not looked happy and who had a crippling addiction to Idolmaster, I'm not even joking about that last part, it was actually believed that any time Berserk went on hiatus is because Miura was too busy playing the new Idolmaster games to focus on writing a new chapter. It's funny, Miura was such a private man that there are hardly any pictures of him online yet everyone knows how obsessed he was with Idolmaster, somewhere in a different reality instead of creating Berserk, he created the best Idol manga ever.

So for those of you who have never watched Berserk before, it's a super dark fantasy manga/anime about a roaming merc named Guts killing demons and searching for the man responsible for his suffering so he can kill him in the most brutal way possible. Now as someone who's seen the animes and read the manga, I stand by the statement that while Berserk may not be the best anime in the world, it's definitely one of the best mangas in the world. And I'm not just talking about the story or characters, the artwork is a straight-up masterpiece, there are so many iconic panels in Berserk they should be hanging up in museums.

Anyway, I wanted to talk about Berserk 1997, the best Berserk adaption we'll ever get. It starts off just like any D&D campaign, in a tavern with a group of guys who look like they have a subscription to ugly bastards weekly, harassing an innocent barmaid and her grandfather. Yeah, very clearly these guys need to die, and die they do, when our hero Guts, a man who looks like he can break stone with his chin, enters and massacres them. Shoots a few of them up with arrows but the real golden chainsaw goes to the last guy after Guts takes him out with his priced sword, the Dragon Slayer, a sword so badass it even has its own introduction.

He tells the only survivor to go let his boss know the Black Swordsman is coming for him, and yes, Berserk came out before SAO so Kirito's scrawly ass stole it from Guts.

So Guts leaves and has one of those PTSD nightmares, it is pretty terrifying.

We later catch up with the big bad of this episode, the most horrifying thing you can imagine...a bald guy. Oh and he's like a snake demon too. So he hears about Guts and gets pissed, so pissed that he decides to destroy the village he's lording over. Luckily Guts shows up and the two have a fight that Guts totally won but the demon is a rotten loser and transforms.

He knocks Guts around a few times, disarms him of his sword but makes the mistake of not disarming him of his prosthetic arm cuz that fake arm doubles as a real cannon. Guts blasts him in the face, chops him in half, and puts the jackass in an early grave. Then we flashback to the past and a very young Guts.

So that's about it, I believe Berserk 1997 is the best adaption we'll ever get. I really love the story and think Berserk is a masterpiece. It takes a huge risk by setting up a story with Guts as a demon hunter then taking a turn and spending the majority of the timeline in the past with a story about political espionage, self-discovery, war, human suffering, the supernatural doesn't even show up until like 20 episodes in when Zodd pops up to shake things up. Anyway go watch Berserk, it's for free on YouTube.",False,anime,1706127081.0,19epyht

Their very and one and the only reasoning is that Anime get's broadcasted on Television.

Which means Anime are TV Show. It does not matter what I said and how I compare or note that there are other mediums or platform to broadcast anything in the form of videos, like Streaming services, Netflix, Youtube. Smart phones, Radios. Or types of media, like movies, short films etc. So if a porn somehow got broadcasted on TV, they will consider it as a TV show too. To them, TV Shows are TV Shows, TV series are TV Series.

There were just so convinced that by the fact that Anime are Broadcasted on the Television.
