[Harem] Is there a manga where the mc has a harem of girls older than him ?,,"Hello everyone,

I know this title seems a bit weird, but lately I've been reading and watching some popular harem series ( megami no café terrace, the mikodono sisters are surpisingly easy to deal with, we never learn etc... ) and this question crossed my mind.

I know that the harem trope is pretty famous and has a wide variety of settings, but is there a serie where a male mc somehow gets a harem of ""older"" girls than him ?

What I have in mind are relationships like the one in we never learn between Yuiga and his teacher, or the ones in Oregairu between Hachiman and his sensei, or even with Yui's mother.

I don't even know if such a serie exists, but considering that there are many different kinds of plots out there, even really questionnable ones with degenerate series, that maybe a ""classical"" plot with a young boy seducing different senpais of his might exist ?

If anything comes to mind, I'd like to hear your recommendations, fanservice/ecchi is okay but I'm not interested in hentai.

Furthermore, even if it's not harem, feel free to share any romcom or romance manga with a man and his senpai, that could interest me aswell ! ",False,manga,1707951861.0,1ar0k3q

So, what am I looking at is a Shonen/Seinen (I think) that's... Really, anything. It doesn't have to follow some scrict guidelines.

Story-wise I'm open pretty much to everything, but it MUST have that ""name your move"". If that makes any sense.

I don't want to tell what I already read because if you suggest something I've already read that scratch that itch I'd re-read it without any problem. Ofc don't suggest Naruto/Boruto/Fairy Tail/100 Year Quest :P

I will leave the literal translation of the synopsis that the OP gave, but from the sound of it it is possible that it is some hentai or very unknown manga, I hope you help me.
""A boy when he was a child was bullied by 4 girls, he was from a very poor family and was skinny, one day those 4 girls crossed the line and due to fate the boy's parents died (his mother was pregnant) the boy He pretends that he committed suicide and says in a letter that it was because of those 4 girls. After faking his death, the boy goes to live with his grandfather who trains him to take revenge. His grandfather was very rich and one day the protagonist finds out that the reason his family was poor was because his grandfather found out about Her daughter's pregnancy threw her out on the street, then our protagonist kills her grandfather and inherits his entire fortune (the protagonist gained her trust and made sure it was in the will and then killed him) after that she plans an elaborate revenge against the 4 girls and the girls are harassed for having killed a family. Then in the future the boy returns to his city to take revenge. The protagonist will not forgive the girls like in many other mangas but rather makes them suffer psychologically until one commits suicide, another goes crazy, and I don't remember the other 2.""",False,manga,1707949368.0,1aqzlr0

If you want a deep story there isn’t here my friend, or at least for the first 3 volumes. The characters are relatable but sometimes they are just really annoying for no reason than other to be annoying, but I might have adapted to that humor by the 3rd volume because I was laughing so hard at this volume, that my mom was giving me looks.

\- **I've Been Kicked Out of an S-Rank Guild. But Only I Can Communicate With Dragons. Before I Knew It, I Became the Greatest Dragon Knight** 

These we're great because the dragons weren't just unstoppable forces or MCs that became human (therefore boring) midway through. I love the worldbuilding of the second one and that there's different species of dragons and etc.

The first one was great because it was a dragon trying to integrate in to modern day life.

My Top 10 Overpowered MC Manhwas,," 

**My Top 10 Overpowered MC Manhwas**

I’m by no means a writer so bear with me, but I can’t contain my love for this genre inside me anymore. 

I personally find it almost therapeutic coming into a manhwa from the start knowing that for the most part, the Main Character is going to be just fine and they’re just going to be pulling off crazier and crazier feats. Is that ‘good’ writing?  Who’s to say, but it suits my tastes just fine at the moment.

Whether they’re a returner with special magic from 4000 years ago, or solo-leveling ranker with the power of the gods, there is something great about witnessing the journey of a character who’s just *better.* They may not be incredible immediately, or maybe they are, but one thing this genre has guaranteed me is many moments when I audibly say “ GODDAMN THAT WAS SICK”.

Also, I read a bunch of them in a short span of time so if I’m misrepresenting anything in the post, feel free to let me know.

**THE LIST:**

**10 - Doom Breaker**

**Story Class:** Returner

>!This is a classic returner story where our hero meets his end as the last human standing vs the demons and then wakes up at the beginning of his journey, with the “assistance” of the Gods.!<

This one places particular emphasis on the MC being resourceful and efficient, both with his time and his available opportunities. Information has higher value than raw strength, at least at first, but as they say, knowledge is power.

**PROS**: It  has a pretty nice class fantasy setting with great art and a nice somewhat grounded feel to the world.

&#x200B;

**9 - Duke Pendragon: Master of the White Dragon**

**Story Class:** Returner with a twist

**Thoughts:** This returner story has a pretty interesting twist that makes it a bit different from other similar stories.

One word I would use to describe this is smooth. The whole story just flows from start to finish. You'll finish it in the blink of he whole story just flows from start to finish. You'll finish it in the blink of an eye. *smooth* . The whole story just flows from start to finish. You'll finish it in the blink of an eye. 

**PROS:** This might be a strange thing to say, but the MC of the manhwa is gorgeous and so are many of the supporting cast. That said, don’t get it twisted, there is a good dose of well-drawn action, surprisingly better action choreography than most, actually. The art in general is great; it brings to life a classic fantasy world excellently. I loved it.

**Caveats**: Some may rate this higher, but the ones higher just had more unique stuff going on / are longer so have had more time to show off more stuff. 

&#x200B;

**8 - Skeleton Soldier Couldn’t Protect the Dungeon**

**Story Class**: Returner with an amazing twist

**Caveats**: Yes, we’re starting with caveats first. To read this you have to be okay with the MC getting a ton of ridiculous power ups very often at a point. Deal with it, or not, but it’s worth it.

The art …changes, and not for the better, in my opinion, along the way. It has such a unique style at the beginning which I’m still mourning. Oh, also it’s another game-UI manhwa.

It’s also not *super* bombastic compared to others in the genre.

**Thoughts:** >!Okay, this is basically Groundhog Day/Re-Zero on steroids.!<

>!The MC dies and gets revived in a spot, and whenever they die, they get stronger and revive in the \* same spot \*. Sounds simple enough, yeah? Well, due to the character’s they meet, and goals they set, the different lives the MC lives go in very different directions.!< It’s good stuff but won’t be for everyone. 

**PROS:** Really cool art for a while. Story really pushes its premise to the limits, and I mean that.

&#x200B;

**7 - Return of the Disaster-Class Hero**

**Story Class:** Returner..kinda?

**Thoughts:** This one is just pure, unbridled, *FUN.* The MC is one strong dude and he knows it and he isn’t afraid to show it. I will say no more. READ IT, IT’S **GODLIKE**.

**PROS:** Fantastic art, fun characters, high power level.

**Caveats:** It’s short. I cri evertim

&#x200B;

**6 - Level Up With The Gods**

**Story Class:** Returner / Ranker (I promise these are not all returners)

**Thoughts:** The cover art really doesn’t do this one justice. I almost didn’t read it because of that. It’s dope!

>!As with a lot of ranker stories, there’s a tower. Well, our hero, as well as many other mythological legends such as Hercules and Sun Wukong, reached the summit. Only to realize there were “others” and those others were impossibly strong. Our hero was sent back in time as the sole hope for all those calling the tower their home. !<

**PROS:** The MCs reputation really precedes him, and he lives up to it. The characterization of the mythological characters is great and not cheesy at all. Very nice art.

**Caveats**: The beginning is not terribly exciting, but luckily also not terribly long.

&#x200B;

**5 - The Legend of the Northern Blade**

**Thoughts**: Hear me out. This starts a bit different from how you would think it would, in the best way. The story takes its time to show the tragic beginnings of the MC and also shows how he lives his life for a decent bit before his “glow up”. 

The way the story and certain characters evolve is fun to see as well. Highly recommend it if you like Murim (Chinese Martial Arts World) manhwa, or haven’t tried ‘em.

**PROS:** Unique art style, lots and lots of cool characters and action shots, good scale up, vicious combat.

**Caveats:** The fight choreography could have been better / story kinda wanes later imo.

&#x200B;

**4 - Nano Machine**

**Story Class** \- OP MOFO

**Thoughts:** What happens when you cross Murim Manhwa with NANO-MACHINES (son) ?

No shit, you get ‘Nano Machine’. 

>!The weak, no-martial-arts MC is almost killed and gets saved by getting nano-machines implanted in his body.!< How? Who cares, you will quickly forget as you keep reading because frankly the plot is just that damn interesting. That’s the highest praise I can give this: it’s just interesting to read. 

You’ll enjoy reading about his journey to gain strength, the challenges he faces, the comrades he gains along the way, the rivals he defeats, and the threats hidden in the shadows looming over. It’s good stuff.

**PROS:** Good art, good story pacing, interesting world, interesting character moments, more vicious than you might imagine.

**Caveats:** The way he gets stronger is sometimes…egregious, but it’s fine.

&#x200B;

**3 - Elceed**

**Story Class:** Super Humans

**Thoughts:** Okay Elceed kind of shocked me, because it’s very different from what the cover art paints it to be. 

It’s a modern and vibrant story that follows an honestly darling super-powered MC, while showing how his life changes after certain events lead him to be exposed to the world of the Awakened. 

**PROS:** Great main characters, Good side characters, great art, nice pacing. Super Speed.  It’s just damn good and also really, really CUTE sometimes. Cats. Lots of Cats.

**Caveats:** Nothing worth writing about tbh.

&#x200B;

**2 - The Beginning After The End**

**Story Class:** Re-Incarnator/ Isekai

**Thoughts:** My personal GOAT. If Solo Levelling is what introduced me to the genre years prior, TBATE is what sucked me back in for good.

>!The story starts with the MC from “childhood” after he dies as a king in another world and wakes as a baby in another fantasy world with more magic than his own. It then follows his life from a child prodigy to his journey growing up and navigating the world, as well as the tumultuous happenings that shape him along the way.!<

Honestly, it’s better than I can describe it. Just read it.

For anime watchers it’s kinda like Mushoku Tensei but less grounded, less character focused, and less creepy. Also with the MC using their powers way better.

**PROS:** Badass MC, So many sick moments,  Cool characters, Generic world, which is actually a good thing because it’s executed so well.

**Caveats:** This one is kind of a big one. At some point the art nosedives in quality. Shockingly so tbh. It’s still worth reading regardless.

&#x200B;

**1 - Solo Leveling**

**Story Class:** Ranker

**Thoughts:** Solo Leveling. What can I say, it’s the first one I, and most, probably read of the genre. 

It’s a typical ranker story about going into and clearing dungeons, just executed to the nth degree.

The most interesting thing about Solo Leveling is how gradually the story ramps up and how crazy it actually gets, imo. That, and the frankly incredible art. It also makes pretty good use of game UI, which is big praise from me because I usually hate game UI. 

Check it out, it’s good.

**PROS:** Great art, Cool characters, nice plot progression. Unique and well-done main gimmick. MC is pretty badass sometimes.

**Caveats:** Okay, this is important, because I almost dropped Solo Leveling because of this, once upon a time. 

When the MC gets a little bit of power, the poses they choose to draw him in are super edgy and super cringe. However, to combat this you must cast your old self aside and embrace your new edgy, cringe-immune self, and carry on reading. Or else. \* teleports behind you \*

&#x200B;

If you made it this far, I really appreciate it. Gold star for you  ☆ 

Feel free to recommend some that I haven’t read! (Though, I’ve read way more than these but there’s only so much time to write).

Forgotten Manga about a Fantasy Magical School... and Zombies?,,"Hey, so this has really been plaguing my mind for ages now, but a couple years ago, I read this short manga set in a medieval fantasy academy which was split into the something like the knight course and the magic course. The protagonist was this red-haired kid in the knight course who wanted to join the magic course since I think he had this special salamander and wanted to learn how to wield it or something (I'm not sure about this part?) and he ends up befriending a boy and girl from the magic course who were also interested about the knights. Anyways, I think someone accidentally opens this evil magic potion jar which ends up causing people to become zombies, >!so the protagonist and his friends end up teaming together and seal away/get rid of the curse.!<

It's a pretty short story and low stakes >!(since I don't think anyone actually dies and the setting is restricted to the academy)!< so I don't think it garnered much popularity but it was a nice story and it irks me that I can't find it anywhere. I tried Baka but I think I keep putting the wrong tags because I can't find it, and if I'm too vague with the tags, I have to look through almost 70 pages worth of series.

Manga about a magic school outcast being OP,Exiled in a Class Trial for Poor Dexterity,"Read it before but I can't remember the name.

It's about a magic school where the students have to provide for themselves while attending it.

There is a reoccuring joke where the MC will do something amazing, the faculty gets excited but destroys the prize as soon as they realize the MC is the one who did it.

At the start the MC gets a bad class and gets kicked out of the classroom group he was in but he can change classes and attributes as he pleases and gains more classes he can change into as he levels up.

Do you know the name of an isekai manga about a girl herbalist/healer in a beautiful forest?,,"I am searching for a manga/webtoon for a month now, cannot find it anywhere! I started reading manga/manhua/manhwas a few months ago. I was SO excited to read everything, I would bookmark as I found them.  My bookmark didn't save and I don't remember the title.  

I was hoping someone may recognize the story. 

It seems the novel is recent, gorgeous (full color) artwork, mostly nature and forest scenes. The opening page has a symmetrical double waterfall with beautiful green forests and trees. Very sparkly. 

I read maybe 5-6 chapters before I lost it (I didn't write down the name).  It is about a teen/young adult girl (possibly red/purple hair) who is wandering the forest.  She is a herbalist and healer and of the last of her tribe (something like that).  

It is NOT: 

• ""the golden forest"" manhwa

• snow white, ""Akagami no Shirayukihime"".

• Manta's ""Under the Oak Tree"", haha. 

She comes across a large tree where she meets two beautiful men (who are actually forest spirits disguised as their human form), also on a journey.  

One of the men has dark black hair (possibly long ponytail hair) he is well-dressed (traditional), very pretty. The manga may be slightly historical, I am unsure. 

The men stopped because the black haired one is sick (or got hurt, I forgot). He is very quiet and also stubborn. 

She makes a herbal medicine for him, cares for him overnight while his friend is searching for help. The black haired man gets better in the morning as his friend returns. The friend is very surprised at her talents. 

In the morning they properly introduce each other and all join forces on their journey. That's all I remember.

20th Century boys by Naoki Urasawa,,"So yesterday I picked up 20th Century boys on a whim from my local Waterstones, I've heard a lot of good things and that it's one of the best mangas along side the likes of Vagabond, Berserk, Vinland Saga, Monster etc. 

So I've read up to about halfway through and my thoughts are, it's a very strange book, there's no gratuitous violence or nudity, there's no big baddy reveal in the first few chapters, it's just a regular guy going through life, with the occasional weird occurance/incident thrown in to make you ask questions, it's definitely a slow burn, and like I say I'm only half way through and I've got so many questions, questions about ""friend"" who definitely seems like the villain of the series.

I was easily able to figure out that Magnetic Rose was based on his manga called Kanojo No Omoide..., but I've had no luck with Stink Bomb or Cannon Fodder.

I've combed his Wikipedia page and didn't seem to see any of them mentioned there. I saw that Kanojo No Omoide... was turned into a short story collection that got localized as Memories. I figured that the stories had to be in their, but upon closer inspection they don't appear to be. I was able to find a video on YouTube where someone flipped through the book and showed off a bulk majority of the pages. None of the titles in that collection match with theirs, and it doesn't seem like any of the other stories follow their premise.

Wikipedia says the ISBN for vol. 2 is  978-1-59816-720-7 but the one I got is 978-1427847010. They both say they are published by Blumanga. Another thing is that the second one does not have the US/CAN prices in the back.

Based on one-shot by Tatsuki Fujimoto

Synopsis: A heart-wrenching single-volume story about the struggles of being an artist, from the creator of Chainsaw Man.

The overly confident Fujino and the shut-in Kyomoto couldn’t be more different, but a love of drawing manga brings these two small-town girls together. A poignant story of growing up and moving forward that only Tatsuki Fujimoto, the creator of Chainsaw Man, could have crafted. (VIZ)

I don't want the typical bad boy, or the super handsome and popular cool womniser senpai.
I don't want the introverted nerd who gets closer to the FL and she sees a unique side of her either.
Sign of Affection and Condition Called Love has a ML that doesn't fall under either of those categories for example. (Granted Condition called love ml isn't really calm and collected but you get the point)

serial experiment lain - i really do wonder why is this thing banned in several countries (it was pretty good tho)  


and the question that i have is 'Why make something so sadistic like redo of the healer and masochistic like midori and 177013 ? Why would writer go out of their way to make a creation that no one asked for ?'  


I believe same is the reason why NTR is so much known in jap adult contents. Are jap writers and directors sadistic or masochist not normal?",True,manga,1707831650.0,1aptq1i

Help finding a fantasy manhwa/webcomic,,"Hi, I would request your help in finding what I remember being a webcomic in a fantasy setting.

The comic is about a redhead girl who uses nature power and is supposedly quite overpowered, they meet a wandering wizard which (as I remember it) is immortal and has been wandering for almost all eternity. He brings the girl and her friend a boy along. The boy gets trained to be a swordsman and the girl as a magician. The girl is later revealed as some kind of prodegy witch who can use all elemental aspects of magic and was using only nature magic because it strengthened the bindings she had on her soul or something.

Find manga?,,"I have been trying to find this manga I read more then 10 years ago. It is NSFW and has a lot of sex in it.
It is about a high school boy who is rumoured to have started a relationship with his step mother. His father caught them and left so now the boy and his step mother live together. The boy likes to be under some stairs outside and look up girls skirts. One day he sees a popular girl(maybe the class president?) walk down them and realises she isn't wearing panties. He blackmails her and they start having sex. She calls him a pervert but actually likes it. At the same time he starts a relationship with his physics teacher. I remember a scene where he is listening to music in class and the teacher catches him and takes a headphone to also listen. The girl finds out about the teacher and they have a alteration. The manga ends with the boy coming home to his step mother, confirming the rumors.
I also remember that the cover was of the girl. I remember reading that manga and can't find it and it is irritating me.

Please help me find the name of this manga!!,,"I have been trying to find the name of this manga (it might be a WEBTOON)for the past two days, so if anyone can help me I would be forever thankful.

It’s a supernatural shounen-ai. Two boys grow up together and one has a “spirit” wolf that nobody else can see except for the other boy (let’s call him boy B, who appears to be extremely confident and outgoing). It focuses them later. Boy B lives with his one remaining friend (the one girl he wasn’t really friends with before) and is extremely insecure. This one athlete (I think they were both in baseball) came onto him and later lied saying Boy B tried to harass him.


I remember this one scene where Boy A invites Boy B and the other girl over—all of Boy A’s friends are supernatural and Boy A works at a witch shop. Boy B loses his ability to see Boy A’s spirit wolf at first, but gains the ability again later.

It's like this: the protagonist is the representative of the mouse in the Chinese calendar, his father (or grandfather) is the leader of the mouse family and he has the power to control people with his voice, later on his father(or grandfather) dies and the power goes to his younger sister who stays as leader while he's doing his shenanigans, in the end he becomes the leader and keeps this power.

He has an affair with a girl who turns into a giant cat, she tries to kill him at first but he manages to calm her down. I think they call her the ""hatred cat""  They begin a love-hate relationship.

I also remember that he had a friend who I think was from the ox family, I remember a scene of her killing demons with her father.

I also remember a mechanic in which the family representing the current animal in the Chinese calendar won a Power UP.

I'd like suggestions for manga where monsters battle each other. Monsters of the feral variety, monstrous animals, beasts like dinosaurs, dragons, or even giant monsters like behemoths, leviathans, etc. Possibly with blood and gore.

I already know about Godzilla, Gamera, etc.

An example is a chapter from Leviathan (Lee Gyuntak)

I'm also fine if you can suggest to me just specific parts of manga where two monsters fight. It doesn't have to be manga centered around monsters brawling

Manga Similar to Mato Seihei no Slave – Search Recommendations,,"Hi,

I would like to know if you had manga of the same type as Mato Seihei no Slave to suggest to me.

As someone who never read manga, I found this one in November and there are several aspects that I like. For example the fantasy genre, which I often read as a novel, the very well-realized characters (to the point that it is not easy to choose a favorite character), the varied powers, the uniforms (I find them so classy), the universe, fights and history. The principle of rewards is, of course, a big bonus, but ultimately it's the whole thing that I really like. The ecchi and nudity side is quite balanced without taking up too much space.

It's a relatively specific manga and I don't know if there's anything even remotely similar. I don't know if there's anything else that would interest me as much, but you never know.

What manga would you suggest?

Forgotten Middle School Manga,,"[ SOLVED, It was Arata: The Legend] Please I need help finding the name of this manga I once read in middle school. It was about two boys who swapped worlds. I think one was a prince in a magical dimension and the other was just a normal high school boy. I remember at the start of the book on the fantasy side before the swap the prince was pretending to be a princess to dodge a ceremony or something. Maybe he wasn’t a prince but that’s why I think he was. The fantasy side was about magic swords. I forget if it was kind of like soul eater where people were weapons or if a person just had a strong weapon they were bound to but for some reason the normal boy who’s now in this world is going around fighting these people who rule with their swords and I think he gains their power once he defeats them. I believe the name was only one word but if any names ring a bell please let me know. 
It’s just been nagging me recently. I only read them physically rented from the library and I remember this one kid always pointed out and flipped to the pages where the series had ecchi fan service pages and he always mashed the name with something inappropriate but I forget what it was.

In Praise of Comedy (also recommend your favourite comedy manga!),,"I am someone who doesn't really do lists or rankings, but some of my friends were talking about their top 10s, 3x3s etc, and I thought, what the hell, let's give it a shot. At first I caught myself trying to make a ""perfect""/ ""objective"" list, and looking at it I just knew it wasn't really MY top 10. So I decided to just go through everything that I have read and rate them honestly based on my enjoyment, and it struck me how much of what I truly love is unexpectedly in the comedy genre. Thing is, I love ""heavy"" media (for lack of a better term) that have layers of themes and meanings with rich and complex characterization and relationships, something that you can sink your teeth into and analyse, pick apart and philosophize about endlessly. Weird and experimental stuff is also totally my jam. So you would think my Top 10 would be filled with drama with some highbrow artsy stuff sprinkled in...

But this is what I settled on:

Grand Blue

Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun

D-frag!

Chainsaw Man

Daily Lives of Highschool Boys

Monster

Angel Densetsu

Berserk

Machida-kun no Sekai

Vagabond

I surprised myself, but then thinking about it, it makes sense. While the intellectually challenging stuff is great, it is a ""luxury"", in the sense that I can only fully enjoy them when all the basic needs are met, i.e. when I am in a good state of mind. If I am feeling down and depressed on the ride home, I can't just crack open Berserk or Monster and just start reading and appreciate them fully. That's where the comedy manga comes in, open it up anytime, anyplace for a pick-me-up and to push the darkness away. And it's like, while analysing and philosophizing gives its own kind of happiness, nothing can beat the pure delight that a good comedy manga can give. So this is just a post to appreciate these gems which I feel I have underappreciated due to my snobiness.

The only thing I can remember about the plot was an object that looked like a pennant making people lose control and attack others.

I know someone here will have an answer.,,"Maybe my brain has turned to mush, or I'm seriously confusing multiple stories into one. So here it goes... I'm trying to remember the title to a story about a FL, that reincarnated/regressed into her past. I believe in her past life she was married off to her first husband for political reasons. I think her first husband went to a war? She eventually remarried another man who was a mage and had a son with him. The husband took the son and disappeared. Which obviously made her very sad. 

She eventually married a third time which according to her memories he was distant and rarely spoke to her. I think he may of been known to her for many years though and seemed to genuinely care for her. I remember she ended up in a dungeon and either dies at her own hand or someone else. The third husband seems to rush to her side at the last moment. Possibly asking her to wait. 


In her current time I believe she is attempting to help her third husband for a bigger revenge story arc. Her third husband also possibly has or had a stutter. Possibly why he was distant towards her in the previous time line. She may of also of been pregnat at the time of her death.

Pandorahearts Book Summaries,,"Hi!

I'm reading my first ever mangas and it's the pandorahearts series. I've read 1 and found it enjoyable, although learning to read manga (I.e opposite directions to what's standard for me) was and still is difficult.

I've just finished book 2 and I feel a bit confused. I sometimes find it hard to follow. It jumps between past and present a lot. I find this hard to be on track with, and I often find it hard to discern who's talking or what order I should follow the panels. I really want to like this manga, but still very confused.

I noticed there's a lack of summaries of each book and I feel like they would help me memorise the important details. I found a guy on reddit who summarised the first book and it helped me a lot to understand, follow and appreciate the book. I can't find any for 2, making my memories of what i read a bit jumbled!

I will start 3 today, hoping more pieces of the puzzle are given to help me string it together. 

Would anyone care to direct me to, or summarise themselves book 2 and maybe 3 for me? This'll help me I think, but it's totally coop if it's too much to ask.

Also, any advice on how manga is typically read? Like what certain things mean that discern what's happening?

Trying to find a manga I read before on mangahub.io,,"the main thing about the first chapter is that people are typed by humans that are normal and humans that are turned into slaves or worse treated like objects.

Want to add that am not sure if it's hentai or not because it seemed more like a dark series rather than hentai because nothing asexual as hentai was shown. read it in Mangahub which is a website that has almost everything, manga, manhwa, manhua, and other stuff relating to it. so is pretty hard to find anything you read in it, if you don't bookmark another normal method of marking what you read is useless to me. as I read and marked why to many things.

Is the Tokyopop translation of Ikki Tousen *actually* bad?,,"I started reading series recently and I’m surprised to find myself loving it. I’m asexual, so the fanservice doesn’t do anything for me, but I’m actually pretty invested in the plot and the characters.
 
I’ve been reading the official English translation, since I’m pretty sure that’s the only one available, and have really enjoyed it. It’s genuinely funny and I feel like the way the characters talk adds to just how shameless the series is. Every now and then, there will be a reference that I’m pretty sure doesn’t exist in the Japanese version, but I’m assuming they’re adding those in place of other references that English audiences wouldn’t understand. Certain people in this community love to go on about how localisation is a crime against humanity and absolutely nothing should be changed, but those people don’t understand how translation actually works.
 
However, I just found out that apparently people generally agree this is a bad translation, and makes *lots* of unnecessary changes and jokes that there aren’t equivalents for in the original. I can’t read Japanese too well and I don’t know about other translations, so I can’t confirm this for myself. I realise this is a pretty niche series, but I was wondering if someone could weigh in on whether it’s really that bad? It would be a shame to drop the series, but so would reading a watered down product.

The reason for this thread's existence is the fact that both requests and suggestions became kind of stale. It's supposed to bring out more manga that is not RTed or recommended. Also, it's quite useful for the discussion of not so current titles.

Previous weeks: [First 72 weeks](http://www.reddit.com/r/manga/search?q=author%3Agladiatorua+What+manga+have+you+read+this+week%2C+and+what+do+you+think+about+it%3F&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all#page=1) and from [June 28, 2015 onwards](http://www.reddit.com/r/manga/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+What+manga+have+you+read+this+week%2C+and+what+do+you+think+about+it%3F&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).

Also, not a rule or any kind of criticism, the more interesting part is not the list of the stuff you read, but your impressions of it.

The mc doesnt like how his class works but still does it because he doesnt see any other way of getting stronger because without killing his party he remains at level one, in other words he needs to constantly get a new party to kill, he isnt the only one of his class that exists, there seem to be many of them and they seem to be trained since childhood.

"Looking for the manga that I read 6-9 years ago, please help me find it.",,"( I'm not good with english so sorry in advance if my grammar is not correct, thank you)

I was browsing in facebook and suddenly remember the manga i read years ago, I think I was 10-12 years old when I read that manga, i'm not really sure since that was long time ago.

So about this manga I will only tell the scenes that i remember, it's not clear tho so it's not accurate but i hope you can help me find it since i really want to reread it again.

There is a male lead, he has dark hair i think and wearing glasses, i think he is still a student and he has a brother (im not sure), he is just walking and then suddenly he passed by in a street where someone is fighting..... (fast forward, i don't remember the next) , he met a girl who is good with katanas, the girl was raised up in a dojo, and is still living there, i think the girl is also his classmate that don't go too often in school since she go out and fight most of the time ( again, im not sure sorry, lets fast forward the story ), he has superpowers ( i'm not sure if he knows, he hide it, or he don't know, i don't remember sorry 😭) his super powers is super strong, maybe its already obviously since he is the male lead, sorry i don't remember what power he has ( fast forward again ), he met people that has super powers , ( i think i remember now, he can imitate the powers of others, not sure again ),  so the people that i remember that he met is, 

1. The girl in wheel chair (not sure if she's really in wheel chair
2. Man with apple head
3. The cat in a suit/clothes
4. Immortal man ( i think he is wearing a military clothing)

That's all i can remember, there is more but i don't remember now

So the last chapter that i read that i remember tho im not sure again is when they formed an alliance with the people he met, then they have war, he fights , that's where i remember those character , the cat with clothes , the man that has immortality power, and the girl in a wheel chair

That's what i remember, sorry if my story is not clear, i'm not really sure of the story since i read more manga and i think my mind was messed up and im confused,  so im not really sure about it, but i hope you can help me, thank you ❤️",False,manga,1707660599.0,1ao8s3d

Can't find this villainess manhwa again,I Played The Role Of The Adopted Daughter Too Well,"Edit: solved!

I read a story a while back that was in early chapters and I guess I never added it to my mal or bookmarks cuz I can't find it again

It's a villainess manhwa about a girl getting reincarnated into a tragedy she read, and the character she becomes is this little girl with purple hair who gets adopted into a powerful family where the potential heirs are encouraged to destroy each other to prove their worth. The protagonist was adopted to prove to the biological children that nothing is guaranteed, and if they don't quit acting entitled then an orphan off the street might take their birthright

I think she also gets some kind of power that makes her eyes turn red.

There were only 11 chapters when I read it so that's all the identifying details I've got. Is anyone familiar with this one?",False,manga,1707658051.0,1ao7xzh

I'm looking for a manhua I read, two years ago maybe. The site was suspended, and you know how it goes: you lose your library.

So, the protagonist is an alcoholic model with silver hair and a terrible character. He's despised by everyone and hated by his co-workers. He meets a brown hair guy who owns the hotel where he is taking pictures (almost drawn in the swimming pool due to the heat).
Those two are gonna expose the protagonist's boss who is obsessed with him, his muse (Actually, he took the protagonist as a model because his father, the real muse, didn't want to do it. But they look alike). The art tends to make an excessive set of teeth when the protagonist is upset (often).

The manga was about the boy having a sexuality crisis since he liked a girl who was a guy. The trans girl proceeds to go for him and have these feelings type for him? I just know that there was a shower scene which was pretty weird. The girl liked the boy before he transitioned and asked him why he did it. In the end of the story the cis boy and trans girl like each other in the end. 

   That’s all I remember. But idk if this will help. Ik it’s some physiological thing since I heard it you give you a type of identity crisis. Anyways I hope you can help me. Please and thanks :)",True,manga,1707623414.0,1anysbj

It was very gory, it was a group of dudes that investigated crimes, the most prominent feature that i can remember from them was that one had a Punk looking hairstyle,a bdsm ball on his mouth and would kiss the dead to find out how they died.


Last thing i remember from it was the end of the first volume,where the group was brought to an island at night where there was a lot of people performing a ritual of sorts,they got their faces covered and after taking the hoods off everyone else on the island was dead on a pretty gruesome scene.

Hajime No Ippo Creator Speaks Against Anime Studios Tweaking The Original Plot Of Manga,,"On February 7, the author of popular manga Hajime No Ippo, George Morikawa, reaffirmed his unwavering support for the rights of people who created their original creative works via a Twitter post.

In the post, he expresses that it is important to preserve the author’s creative vision, and they will always believe that they will always have a final say in it.

He also highlights that the purpose of the laws is to protect the proprietary rights and authority of the original writers in their work.

Morikawa states that although readers, editors, and adaptators could shed light on previously published materials, only the original creator knows the future of the story.

For this reason, they should have complete control over their work.

He further states that the original artists might be given the freedom to exercise their legal rights to the unrestricted maintenance of their intellectual properties.

Morikawa, however, also indirectly targeted anime studios for changing or adding their interpretation to the manga creator’s work.

***“The reason is absolute because the original author is absolute. Just as before, this message is also for aspiring manga artists. Despite facing backlash, authors have continuously asserted their absolute authority. The rights of primary creators, including manga artists, novelists, and screenwriters, are protected by law. And what’s crucial is that only the original author knows the future. That’s why it’s absolute.***

***Everything that editors and adaptors, including readers, see, is already in the past. Only the original author knows what the future holds. This is even more true if the series is still ongoing and unfinished. Any alteration, intervention, or adaptation of the past will erode the present and affect the future. That is why it is important to discuss and give your opinion. What is needed is respect, gratitude, and courage, not an overbearing attitude. The future that the work and its readers look forward to should not be ruined or lost because of the bending of others who only know the past. Only the author can protect the work’s future.”***",False,manga,1707564190.0,1ane7su

Any manga recs similar to chainsaw man?,,"Does anybody have any recommendations for a series similar to chainsaw man?

The art is also SO FKNKN GOOD like you'll go from panels feeling kinda shaky and half drawn, which add to the chaotic style, to a super elaborated 5 point perspective panel of denji and power sitting in the subway (that or just some beautiful grotesque gore demon with crazy design).

This is going to be all over the place, but all I remember is a boy starts his life as a civilian(maybe even a farmers son) and has level 0 powers. People can have all sorts of levels and different powers. There are monsters(I think low level demons/goblins). Somehow he becomes strong and has a girl join him (I think she was the princess) and more people(mostly girls I think it was a harem) join him. If I remember right he meets the hero’s the king favors and they’re rude to him. He finds ways to work around stuff like he had to fight this big knowledgeable dragon/monster and instead of doing the puzzles to open the door he just dug a hole to it. He also ends up getting a little demon girl on his team but demons are killed so they hide her horn with a ribbon. This is possible spoiler but he finds out if you kill the demon king the world is reset and he doesn’t want that to happen so he doesn’t kill the demon king. Him and his team also need money so they open a restaurant/cafe/casino? The last thing I remember is he starts a war with the king because he doesn’t want to reset the world.",False,manga,1707545714.0,1an9pzf

Manga Collecting,,"Wassup reddit, this is my first post ever and I wanted to ask y'all if you have some recommendations for me!  
I started watching anime a few years ago but I only started reading manga on 2023.  
I've watched a few anime (Berserk \[90's version\], Hellsing ultimate, AoT, Demon Slayer, Inuyashiki, Undead Unluck, Jjk, Mob Psycho 100, 91 days, Chainsaw MAn, Death Note, Deadman Wonderland, Banana Fish, Biao Ren and many others...) but because I've only started reading manga a couple of months ago my collection is still slim. I've got all of Death Note Black editions, Monster 1st vol. , 3 Tokyo Ghoul Vol., 3 jjk Vol, One Punch Man also 3 Vol. , Gannibal 1st vol., Uzumaki, Chainsaw man 12 vol., and a couple of more mangas that were translated to portuguese (samurai and shinobi stories like 'O preço da desonra' and 'Butterfly Beast'). I've tried to get my hands on Dorohedoro and Inuyashiki but it's hard. I've read all the mangas I have (except I'm only now finishing Monster vol.1).  
I've read Fire Punch online and I absolutely loved it. I also love Chainsaw Man.   
So, you've seen I kinda like R rated mangas and gore and stuff like that, so do you have any recommendations for me?
