New to manga,,"I have been watching anime for a little over a decade . I’ve enjoyed every bit of it . But these days, everything I watch seems to be the same story recycled over and over . Nothing truly feels new anymore and as arrogant as it sounds, I feel like I’ve seen it all . I find myself constantly rewatching certain anime just to get that taste of a fresh, amazing, unique story . I’m not saying I’m giving up anime, but I think it’s time to pick up some manga 

I have never read any manga up until a few weeks ago when I decided to continue the chainsaw man series by picking up the manga where the anime dropped off. And It’s been a fun read . But now that I’ve finally dipped my toe into manga, I realize there are so many unique stories out there that hasn’t been animated yet. I feel like I have so many opportunities . I also finished book one of Goodnight PunPun. Another amazing series that is different from anything I’ve seen . 

Basically, I wanted to see if you guys could recommend a newbie like me some manga that has an amazing story . Is unique, and has had a lasting effect on you . I love stories that leave an impression . I’m open to anything . 

I wish I could give a specific genre but my taste is all over the place . Here are a few anime that I like that might give you an idea 

Now and Then, Here and There
Steins Gate 
Tokyo Ghoul + Parasyte the Maxim- (I love drastic character development) 
Kobayashi Maid Dragon 
March comes in like a Lion 
Re-Zero 
Wolf Children 
Silent Voice 
The Boy And The Beast 
Made in Abyss
The Girl who leapt through time 
Chainsaw Man 
The Evangelion Series
JJK


I wish I could name more but it would be a very long post . To highlight something, one particular thing I enjoy very much is seeing character development. I love seeing a bad guy turning good . Or a good guy turning bad . I love seeing a character that grows strong by going through pain and hardship (not through the power of friendship or some hidden ability they discover in them).

im looking for a stepsibling manga i read years ago that i cannot remember the name of for the life of me

WARNING THIS IS GONNA BE SPOILERS FOR LITERALLY EVERYTHING I REMEMBER

>!i know that at the start the FL dressed up as a highschooler (both characters are adults tho) and when she was outside she ran into her step brother (ML). the ML hit on her and asked her out and she saw this as an opportunity to use him and humiliate him when they broke up. so they date and she tries to hold off on actually touching him or anything but they eventually kiss and shes still doing it under the guise of humiliating him. later on she tries to break it off but cares for him a bit now so she does it via saying shes moving away to another country with her grandma, he gets very upset and a little depressed and she (as his sister) sees hes not doing great with her gone so she as the gf tells him shes actually coming back to japan so hes not depressed. they eventually have sex (he still doesnt know its her) and at some point he finds out about it and they discover that when they were kids (when theyre parents were only dating i think?) they both kinda liked each other but were shy so eventually grew apart and thought the other hated them.!<

>!flashforward they go on a ski trip with their friends (i kind of want to say they went as siblings? theyre friends didnt know theyre dating yet?? BUT IT COULD BE THE OPPOSITE AND THEY WENT AS BF/GF NOT SIBLINGS), they have a cute moment but i dont remember it and yeah. they tell their parents about them dating and the parents take it suprisingly well and in the end they get engaged/married!<

Why is Scary Campus College University cancelled ?,,"**Note**\- *I am following the example of one of the previous thread* [*https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/199ghus/why\_has\_legendary\_moonlight\_sculptor\_struggled/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/199ghus/why_has_legendary_moonlight_sculptor_struggled/) *in order to prevent this thread from being cancelled.* 

&#x200B;

Do you know the horror manga seinen manga by Close your eyes hoshino creator Nagashii Kouhei called Scary Campus College University ? It was about a college freshmen named Chigarashi Mahina, who wanted to live a university life, while dealing with supernatural elements that threaten her, which is when she seeks the help from a man named Kaoru Makube an expert in the supernatural to protect her.

The series is unique because it provides drama with horror elements that you read from various horror manga, especially where chapter deal with a ""monster of the week"" format where Mahina and Kaoru deal with a supernatural horror on Campus in each chapter/arc, the series in experimental with diversity like Chapter 30 which is a ""lower deck episode"" where the main characters are not in it as it is a standalone scary story but is still part of the series, chapter 62 And 63 which are the only chapters/arc that doesn’t contain the supernatural ""monster of the week"" but instead focuses on the real threat in society which is proven scary in real life ""scam artists"" where they trick people into giving them money and chapter 64 which has a minor appearance of the main character Kaoru but includes a new character who is also an expert in the supernatural.

Despite that, however, it was announced from Kouhei's Twitter account on 31st December 2023 [https://twitter.com/kohei\_nagashius/status/1741420772059750759](https://twitter.com/kohei_nagashius/status/1741420772059750759) that the series is cancelled, and it will end next week, and it was a shame too because it was a mixture of drama and scary elements, and that Kouhei did handle horror, if the series continued, we could have explored Mahina attending her 3rd and final year of university while dealing with dangerous supernatural threat while understand which supernatural creatures are good and bad and if there are some humans who are evil like the supernatural monsters, we could have been introduced to another supernatural specialist from chapter 64 and a final arc where Karou and Chigarashi along with their allies will prepare for their final battle against Kaoru’s old master who is about to unleash something terrifying to the whole world.

So in this thread we need to discuss few thingslike 

why is Scary Campus College University  cancelled, was it due to the low sales of the volumes or something?

Can Nagashii Kouhei continue to do horror like he did with Scary Campus College University with dark horror story anthology series much like most horror mangaka like Junji Itou did, or since he is good at female designs, perhaps another genre like maybe school life harem series or maybe an isekai harem manga series since well the isekai genre is popular, and he is good at fanservice with the girls.",False,manga,1706101081.0,19eghwa

about having a good memory and oneshots,,"i was scrolling through youtube shorts and i saw a video of guys trying to remember 3 characters with some specific characteristic in 5 seconds, for example, name 3 characters with red hair, etc etc etc.  


seeing these videos i think that i can barely remember any name of characters of the majority of mangas i've read, and sometimes i think about it and i kinda feel sad but at the same time i can't understand how can someone remember the name of so many characters.  


I ve used characters as examples but i can't really remember well some(most) parts of the story too. Actually i've read 575 mangas, being 236 of them oneshots, but obviously i don't expect to remember each one of them, but i like to think that i just remember those i like the most, and the most i like, more i remember. I'm really impressed when i see someone talking about several animes and mangas and remembering everything.  


also, i've observed something kinda obvious but i remember much more mangas with more chapters than just oneshots, and not because they are short, because i remember some of them, but i think that not every author handles well this type of manga. and with this i think the most time you spend reading something regardless of how long it is, you will relate more to it.

Looking for a manga (VERY vague description),,"I'm looking for a manga that I read once AGES ago. I don't remember much about it, so this is gonna be very vague and it's okay if no one can recognize it from this, but thought I'd give it a shot. Been wondering for a long time.

The setting was some sort of Magic School? The main character (I think) was a girl with twin tails (hair might have been red or reddish). The only other character I remember was this glasses-wearing dude (blonde?) who was maybe bullying her or just didn't like her for some reason, they were like rivals or enemies? He was very good with Magic Stuff, and she might not have been at first.

The Magic School had a Magic Tournament/Competition of some sort, and I remember Main Girl and Glasses Guy had to team up at some point and became friends and/or fell in love during it. Or started falling in love. Maybe. But I never got to see if they ended up together, because I guess the manga wasn't updated and then I lost it.

When I say I read it ages ago, I mean it could've been at any point between 2007-2015. Art style was not too detailed/mature, so honestly the characters could've been anything from elementary schoolers to high schoolers?

1. I was reading it on MangaDex so it is (or was) uploaded there
2. The art style is kind of chibi-ish, but every character is an adult
3. The premise is that there was a high school reunion, I think? But suddenly something paranormal happened and a group of the attendees were sealed in the old school, kind of like isekai I guess. It was a group of 1 man and maybe 4 or 5 women. They had to survive so they used the school's resources to grow their own food and each person had different roles, but the man was treated worse than everyone else. He secretly had a sexual relationship with one of the women (she had pigtails or braids and glasses, basically looked like a quiet shy girl) who convinced him to kind of use sex to gain control of the whole group eventually or something like that.

Finding a specific manga/manhua/webnovel I forgot the name of,,"Hey. Around one or two years ago I read a manga, manhua or webnovel. I tend to manhua, but I'm not sure. The setting is the typical ""world turns into a game with a game like system"". The MC returns from the future, so he knows about what will happen and about how to survive the tasks that will come.

The story starts shortly before new year's eve. It's the modern world somewhere in Asia (south Korea probably) in a big city with skyscrapers. It's snowing. Classmates of the MC try to bully him (if I remember correctly, they go a bit overboard with it, or at least try to). But MC with his knowledge and skills from his past life can defeat them easily. At exactly 00:00 (the people and the talk show/news show that is shown from time to time counts it down from ten to zero), the world transforms. Every human receives a status window with a message and the ""games"" start. People are locked at the places they are in right now, some kind of invisible barriers divide the areas into smaller parts and each part has it's own survival game. Many people die, because the tasks are mostly very hard and include some kind of monsters. The MC is more of an anti hero. His own survival is more important to him than that of others and he even tries to use other humans to his advantage, to make himself stronger, even at the cost of them dying.

Setting: Fantasy/adventurer. People have skills, don't remember seeing non humans. 


Story: The main character is part of an adventurer group. His skill give an exp boost I believe but he is no longer able to keep up with his group and retires on good terms.

Land is granted to him and he travels to a rural village to be the new lord. Along the way he meets and befriends a merchant who becomes his trusted advisor. He develops the village/country by using his exp boost skill for all the villagers. 

He trains the villagers to use weapons that suit their natural ability, like lumberjacks as Frontline warriors, pearl diver as an archer. He forms them into groups and teaches battle strategy. 

He brings them to farm monsters in different areas and raises money and their strength quickly due to the boost. He allies with neighboring nations, I remember there was a ninja type country and maybe one that built ships.

I made this post a year ago, however still no one was able to tell me what the title of the manga is. 


The manga was about a blue bird humanoid and red humanoid snake’s child and bird/ eagles. The blue bird has the ability to give Immortality(which the golden bird tried to force him to give him immortality but the blue bird declined and flee) to one person, which he given it to the red snake(his lover) due to her almost dying during child birth.   The eagle/bird relationship with the snakes was enemy and the eagle/bird guards cut off the red snake’s head(she didn’t die cause she was immortal). Her lover’s body was stolen by the villain of the story(something about a gold bird) but her child was able to escape due to the other snake citizens escaping and the child live on earth.   Also the gold bird’s original body was extremely weak, so he used the blue bird’s body. The daughter grew up, they were going to high school or college(forgotten)they always kept their hair short but their power started to show and their hair always grew super long. They also met with a boy that was in a eagle/bird tribe, the boy did tried to kill her that was before they became friends and they helped one another.   If I’m correct, the blue bird was injured when the red snake female first met him and the red snake helped him and they get to know each other. That time the snake tribe gotten a disease and tons of people were dying cause of it, the red snake was also one of the third most beautiful snakes of the tribe. The red snake was willing to risk her life to find the flower that was able to save her tribe.   That is currently what I remembered, if someone know the name of that manga please tell me.

[Recommendation] It's hard for me to detect a quality Action Manga,,"Dear Community.

I need some help finding a good action manga(Manhwa is also welcome). I looked into the TOP 50 manga list on MAL but I still want your opinion on what to read.

Recently I started reading Tokyo Ghoul (Watched the Anime in the past) and I like the ""unique"" story and the characters. 

What I desire:

\- The MC (Male or Female) is weak and he/she is getting stronger (Read as character development)

\- No ""medieval"" setting (Berserk, Vagabond, Vinland Saga...)

\- No magic as magic circles (I just can't)

\- No unnecessary ""Ecchi"" (Fighting for titi\*\*s...)

\- At least over 150 chapters

\- No Anime adaptation (Not necessary)

\- If possible modern world (Also not necessary)

\- No mecha, space, mystery 

\- No isekai (Well, only if it's good) (Have read: Solo Leveling - but didn't like it too much)

I don't want to make the list too long. So feel free to recommend me something (My Manga list on MAL is quite ""small""). 

I like the world of Tokyo Ghoul. But I'm open to more. Even better if the manga is ""a hidden gem""

Thank you very much!

Tip of my tongue Kitsune Manga.,Youkai Gurentai,"A while ago I found a Manga about a Supernatural special force that went around dealing with crimes from other supnats, with the main protagonist being this lady who hates Yokais/Supnats because they killed her family when she was young, but she's actually a Kitsune herself. 

I believe there was a scene where a Kitsune was described as loving Chaos and was there whispering into the ears of leaders to cause wars and chaos.

I can't for the life of me find out what the Manga was called again, any help will be much appreciated! Thank you in advance.",False,manga,1706183814.0,19f7ofs

Immersive Manga Recommendations,,"Now, this might be a bit too specific and vague of a recommendation request, but I'm looking for a manga to get lost in.

Recently I've been feeling kind of down and bored all the time, and because of winter I'm not leaving my house as much, so I find myself just doing nothing for most of the day. To counter this boredom, I'd love to find a series that I could get lost in. Ideally, I'd like a bit of a longer series (but not too long, 30 volumes max), with characters that I'd fall in love with, a cool world, an engrossing plot, and action would be nice as well, but it's not a must. And since I'm kind of impatient, if the manga can hook me from the very start, that would be even better.

For reference here are some series that I've already seen and think fit this criteria:

\- Hunter x Hunter

\- Magi

\- Mushoku Tensei

\- One Piece

\- Golden Kamuy

\- Fullmetal Alchemist

but I've been re-reading some older series, and picking up a new one and I know I'm gonna eat through it faster than expected. Liar's Game, a Psycho Drama Mystery that honestly I didn't think i'd enjoy, but I am.   


I like smart characters. I like character growth. I like the game of chess in the heads of people. I also like games in general, where cards, dice, and a board game are made nefarious due to the stakes involved.   


So I come to you looking for recs. 

I've read or at least looked into the following. 

Death Note - Meh, It was good, but I would have liked less Kira. 

KAKEGURUI - Dear lord I tried to like this. I stuck with it for a while but when extended family got involved I stopped. There's only so much suspension of disbelief I can take before it becomes contrived. 

Kaiji - I started it a ways back, dropped because idk. Should I pick it up again? Is it worth? 

The World is Money and Power - Started good, and it suffered the fate of many of its kind. It started focusing more on the side characters BS and not actually doing shit with the plot. Got board after MC disappeared for 5+ chapters. 

??? Game? - I cant remember what it was, but there was a story about a guy who went into a game with a bunch of other people and if their heart rate went too high they would die? And there was a lot of psychological warfare going on... Cant remember the name, but I would like to read it again. 

No Game No Life - Too far in the wrong direction. I have no feeling of stakes in any of these games, and the MCs are both creepy af. 

Battle Royal - Its an artifact of its time. Hard for me to read now. Good ideas, but implemented in what feels like shock value. 

???? Game? 2 - Another one I read and cant remember. A lot of people are suddenly sucked into a ""Game"" world and have to do things to stay alive. Gets really heavy really fast with disturbing characters. MC starts off ""nice"" but then you find out it was an act and he's REALLY twisted. Can't remember the name, would like to revisit.

An Adult Love Story : Tonari no Aki to wa Kakawaranai,,"I found this very interesting. This story takes a look at the assumptions we make about others feelings and the lies we tell in social situations. It looks at how misunderstandings can hurt and shape us.

Uzuki isn't a beauty, wasn't popular in highschool and has a bad attitude when it comes to handsome men. In highschool she was close friends with the most popular and handsome boy in her school. After a misunderstanding they grew apart. 10 years later she has a new neighbor, none other than Aki, who is still as handsome and popular as ever and who still wants to be close to her.

He is dealing with his own baggage which I don't want to give spoilers away here. A short love story of only 14 chapters about highschool friends given a second chance by fate, a simple grounded love story, give it a try.

There is also a cat.
