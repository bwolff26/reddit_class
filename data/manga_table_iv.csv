[SL] (Request) Miss Kiryu Doesn't Understand Love,SL,"Summary:

""32-year-old Futaba Kiryu is a manga artist that writes for a weekly shounen magazine. Her latest ongoing manga is a romantic comedy, ""Bocchi no Ore kara Riaju no Omaera ni Ittoku"" (A Loner Like Me's Got a Lot to Say about You Normies out There) or ""Bottoku"" for short. It is a best-seller and has an anime adaption on the works. But the truth is, she's completely clueless about romance.

The days go on as she continues on working on her manga with her manga assistants, but soon, one of her assistants, Hiro Asakura (she dubs him as ""Assassin"" because of his cold and intimidating demeanor), and the anime scriptwriter for the ""Bottoku"" anime, Kitamura Kyosuke (social media dubs him ""The Tactician"" for his notoriously clever execution in the anime he's worked in) grow an interest in her and eventually make a move on her. How will Futaba fare in this love triangle when her knowledge of romance is next to nothing?""

I noticed this manga hasn't been translated in almost a year, and currently 51 out of 54 chapters have been translated. I'm hoping that this post can help bring attention back to it so either the previous translation group could have it brought to their attention to finish it or a new interested group could finish it if the translation was dropped completely.

Rose Garten Saga is one of the most entertaining and enjoyable reads I've ever had with manga. [100% Recommend],,"For full context, I had no idea what this manga was. No one recommended it to me, I've never heard of this title before, I was just casually browsing manga for some spice and saw it as one of the suggested entries. 

I didn't read the synopsis or ANYTHING. And I... honestly believe that's the best way to experience the manga. I don't even want to give any sort of plot synopsis because I think it's just that important to go in blind. The only thing I guess I should prefix is that this is something I recommend to people **at least 15 and above (PLEASE NOTE)**. Also it's an ""action"" centric manga. 

From the first chapter, I KNEW this was going to be special. There was a certain hook to it that just left my jaw on the floor with how out of left field it was. I didn't expect the Plot and ""Plot"" to go that hard. I can't really show any of my favourite panels here, but holy shit the art is God tier as well. I can very easily see why it didn't explode like other manga, but man... this thing underappreciated as hell.

This gave me the feeling I wished I got from Records of Ragnarök. I go over more of my thoughts in depth [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/1597wze/im_disappointed_with_records_of_ragnarok_manga/). But essentially I felt like Records of Ragnarok felt like it underutilized some amazing concepts with its story, opting instead to go for the safer 'brawl' approach to a lot of the fights. While RGS isn't really meant to be like ROR aside from a key concept, I feel it just handled the concept in a far more creative way. And it led into some breathtaking fights with art and paneling that can go toe-to-toe with ROR (I feel like ROR's Art is what truly elevates it to breathtaking heights). The choreography and ideas for match ups feels endless and the dynamics go absolutely insane. 57 chapters in and it still  feels like there's SO much more this manga has to offer.

I really... REALLY want to post some of my favourite panels here because they are drawn beautifully, but anyone who's read it I'm sure can understand why I can't really do that aside from the spoiler stuff. 

The cast is also very diverse in the sense that we get all kinds of people in both ethnicities and abilities that make sense in the context of what their characters represent. 

Also, the comedy here is hilarious. I felt so many things while reading this, but the last thing I expected (aside from the action) was how genius the comedy is. This manga has a trait to it that could've been so easily used for cheap 'shots' and low hanging fanservice, but the way they integrate it into both the plot and the characters makes it inseparable from the story itself. 

People who have read this knows I'm leaving out or trying to dodge what that *main thing* is, but I just can't forget how I felt reading that first chapter and getting slapped with a certain scene with an old man. Going into it blind imo is 100% the best way to experience it.

The only way to fight the aliens was in the form of these mecha child soldiers(or robot suits not sure). So the crippled soldier is instructed to help a little girl because she is suffering from ptsd and couldn't fight or they will get rid of her/destroy her, because she is wasting the materials that could be used to build another one.

The next thing I can remember is that there are monster like figures made out of some black smoke and they have weirdly shaped heads and thats how they fight, a major event was happening in a hospital and I remember the MC killing someone on the roof or throwing them off a roof of the hospital.  


I know the MC and a following character ( if I'm not wrong a blonde teenager ) stole a motorcycle then hid in the mountains, the MC left him behind near a river and ran away to a nearby village where he was taken in by some grandma for a while.

Title of an old unfinished isekai manga,,"Hello, good morning.

I'm looking for an old incomplete manga, and I'll do my best to describe what I remember of it.

It's about a girl who somehow lands in a fantasy world, sort of Escaflowne style. I think she wears pajamas throughout the manga. At the beginning, she shows up in the fantasy world and, I don't know if she gets attacked or something, but she's saved by a centaur who's like a faun. Then, there's a chat - maybe around a campfire - and suddenly she's spied on by an evil wizard or sorcerer from another side of the world.

In the last vignette of the manga, she is about to cross a bridge to meet someone who was supposed to help her.

The manga was left hanging, with only three or a handful of chapters, as far as I remember. What caught my attention most were the illustrations, very detailed and well-drawn. I was curious, and when I tried to find the author, it turned out that he had passed away, which probably explains why the manga was never finished. At the time, in the wiki it said that he drew manga for adults, before doing this manga.",False,manga,1706648691.0,1aezbqs

With the help of the system he has the ability to switch between professions.

"[REC] Isekai/transmigration that deals with the erasure of the ""host"" person/identity?",,"Of course, in some stories this is irrelevant, either because they reincarnate as a baby, or into a host that died.

But for the large number of stories in which the protagonist is transmigrated/reincarnated into an already existing person, most seem to just ignore the fact that the previous identity of the body just got essentially erased.

So, are there any good stories where this aspect is properly engaged with in the story? I've found a couple that are in this vein: *The One Within the Villainess*, and *My Body Has Been Possessed By Someone*.

But these are more where the other identity still exists. Are there any that deal with the consequences of an entire identity fully being erased, and replaced? I'd imagine it would be pretty hard finding out one of your loved ones has essentially died, and been replaced by some stranger.

jujutsu kaisen message to the idea of Heroic / Ultimate Sacrifices as a concept.,,"Almost every week we get the same rant. My favorite character dies this chapter. Gege is a terrible writer with a mid-level manga. 

Don't you guys understand the meaning of the characters deaths.  You don't understand the series and the message it's trying to bring that's why you're so disappointed. 

 the message is short answer don't throw everything away for quick and easy wins. instead face the hard challenges life bring you and try your best to overcome even when you lose sometimes that just the only you can become stronger. 

You can see with Megumi talk with Gojo after the baseball game. Dying to win and risking your life to win are not the same thing. Jujutsu Kaisen really is opposite to the idea of Heroic / Ultimate Sacrifices as a concept, really.

That is why Megumi's obsession with Mahoraga was a flaw. People die, but they should die trying their best rather that resigning themselves.  Gojo literally told Megumi that's relying on his truck card is a crotch because always thinking that he can win from it prevent him from trying other ways of getting stronger.   

The characters who reach their true potential and succeed the most in the narrative are the ones who were risking their lives to become stronger while the ones dying to win achieve almost nothing. 

Example Yuki Tsukumo and Fumihiko Takaba  vs Kenjaku.

During Yuki and kenjack fight Kenjaku  scolded her for fighting with no real self-confidence by not using her domain because she think she lose in a domain battle. Even when she pushes to defeat, she still never uses her domain instead on a suicide attack on him. Kenjaku even said she was really boring.

 Now with Fumihiko he was being deconstruction by Kenjaku for being a half ass Comedian and kenjaku was a better comedian then Fumihiko is. Fumihiko was losing confidence in himself because he knew kenjaku was right, his CT wasn't working anymore which was link to his confidence, and he was being pushed in defeat but then Fumihiko dogged deep inside and realizing why he become a comedian.  

Regain his confidence and his CT and told Kenjaku that he was going to give it his all to Kenjaku his audience! Fumihiko was going to Kenjaku laughs so hard he going to puka his guts out and shocking Fumihiko end up winning and making kenjaku enjoy himself in years.

Their fights is a great parallel both lose confidence in themselves both he different is Fumihiko regain his but Yuki didn't. ",False,manga,1706558225.0,1ae4ixm

[Manga tropes you hate],,"I'm not really sure if these can be classified as 'tropes' :

- Weak female co-lead/Damsel in Distress 

- Any situations where adult female characters behave like little sisters or little children - it's creepy af! (A lot of manga authors are creeps)

- Fanservice, especially in serious moments. Think of fire force cat girl character. 

- Adult women I'm kid bodies.

Alright so pretty much any creepy behavior belitting women I guess lol

And we find out later that the guy getting arrested is one of those creatures and he has powers and if I remember correctly he was like a leader or just very powerful.

I need help because I might go insane if I don't remember this manga's name!,,"So years ago I read a manga with insanely beautiful art. It used a very old drawing style even for the time so I'm assuming it was from the 90s or earlier.... the plot I remember is:
Young girl is born in a Celtic village with black hair, this isn't normal and a sign of druidic potential (everyone else has light hair), she's apprenticed to the local magic dude. 
From here I'm not sure of the order... I know she is captured and enslaved by Romans at one point, travels through the Fae realm, is trained as a fighter by a bunch of Celtic warrior women and eventually defeats this big bad guy who's mother is a bad druid (?). I think she also has some spirits that are contracted to her or just help her. And there's a scene where a unicorn protects her from the big bad guy and dies after being tainted.

I'm trying to find a psychological manga where the mc is the heir to some old rich family with a spooky history in the countryside.,Amnesia Labyrinth,"So the plot of the manga isn't too original but I read it when I was getting into manga and I could not remember what the title was. I read it back when KissManga was a thing. I always wanted to find it so I can finish it because it has an interesting mystery element to it and the main character seems to loath his family but for some reason he still returned and becomes the next heir of that family. It was the type of old samurai families that had some long curse or magic they pass on to the next family head and the main character is uncovering what the family mystery is. One thing I remembered about it is that the house has a maid and she's an illegitimate child of the previous head of the family and so she serves as a maid and concubine to the mc (they do end up actually sleeping together so there is some incest in it).

Last time I read it was back in 2015 and it's quite hard to find in the Web cos of how it's not that unique so I'm not sure if many people may know of it.",False,manga,1706498845.0,1adlf0f

So far the closest things I could find are Spice and Wolf, Wotakoi, Ice Guy and his cool female Colleague, Nodame Cantible, and Spy x Family.

Note 1: For the record I don't mind if they have sex, but I would prefer that they either develop their bond first or get married first before they ""bone"" each other.

Note 2: I don’t mind LGBTQ couples so long as they are respectful and don’t perpetrate any bad stereotypes.

Looking for a manga title maybe a shojo manga,,"
Looking for the name of a manga that I read awhile ago. The things I remember from it are the Male mc and the fmc both go to the same high school. They both have what I would call guardian spirits. They both feel a connection to each other. Eventually the male mc starts to have dreams about his past life back in feudal japan where he was I think a commoner and the fmc was a priestess or something that had bells in her hair. Anyway I think they talk to the fmc and her spirit about it and the spirit who was her bodyguard in the past starts to actively try to keep them apart so they don’t fall in love again like in the past. There is also a scene where he goes back to the family shrine or something at the graveyard I believe during a school breakand his helping clean up and he trying to find out stuff about the past and finds a box with one of the bells that the fmcs past self gave his past self as a declaration of love before he had to go to war. Also the priest or whatever says he can have them because he’s the only one who’s ever been able to open them or something and he is destined for them. After that for the towns celebration the fmc is chosen to play her past self and the bells resonate revealing the past scene of him coming back from the war to find the fmc’s past selves house on fire and his past self tries to rescue her and find her by shouting her and also perishes I think. It’s also revealed that the mcs spirit was also one of his former friends. They come back to the present where they are doing a reenactment of the fire and starts shouting the girls name and I believe the bells resonate agin or something. I think it’s also revealed that some of their other friends also had past lives that were involved in theirs in some shape or form.",False,manga,1706490040.0,1adiglp

The reason for this thread's existence is the fact that both requests and suggestions became kind of stale. It's supposed to bring out more manga that is not RTed or recommended. Also, it's quite useful for the discussion of not so current titles.

Previous weeks: [First 72 weeks](http://www.reddit.com/r/manga/search?q=author%3Agladiatorua+What+manga+have+you+read+this+week%2C+and+what+do+you+think+about+it%3F&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all#page=1) and from [June 28, 2015 onwards](http://www.reddit.com/r/manga/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+What+manga+have+you+read+this+week%2C+and+what+do+you+think+about+it%3F&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).

Also, not a rule or any kind of criticism, the more interesting part is not the list of the stuff you read, but your impressions of it.

"Searching for a Manga with Gangs and Rivals, any help appreciated!",,"Hello :),

I'm having a bit of a nostalgic  moment and there's this particular manga that I remember from about a  decade ago which has been stuck in my mind. This post might  sound a bit weird, but I was hoping if anyone here could help me recall  the name of this manga, since I've been wanting to revisit it.

The  manga was mainly centered around gangs and rivalries. There was this  particularly strong main character who was admired and sought after by  all gangs because of his strength. Despite their constant efforts, he  always turned down their offers to join any gang. The character was a ""lone wolf"" and didn't like talking to anyone.

Additionally,  there's this one scene that was especially emotional. It involved a girl who was being severely bullied by  another group of girls. The bullies dubiously made her eat an orange  peel.

It was a quite  fascinating manga and still holds a special place in my heart, but it's  extremely frustrating that I can't remember its name. I’ve been  searching for a while now but with no luck. If these details ring a bell  to anyone, your help would be greatly appreciated.

Problem with video-game manga,,"There  are many different manga/manhwa or whatever with some kind of  ""leveling""-system in them. I understand that a self-insert protagonist  in a power-fantasy using a ""magic/skill-system"" most people are familiar  to through games is a combination that sounds like instant success...  But I am sick of it!

There are  sooo many manga where the author do the absolute minimum to the point  where it is embarrassing... The biggest difference between manga and  video-games is that video-games are interactive. I know this is  obvious... but you know what is also obvious? That the UI of video-games  is made frustrating as little as possible. The result of this is often  an oversimplification that would make no sense in reality.

Good examples for such an oversimplification is the use of stats:  
In  most games you normally want to know as much as possible, but don't  want to do any math or anything like that. As a result you can normally  look at a melee weapon and see the damage(and sometimes even your  attack-speed/weapon weight) it does being visualized as a number... This  whole thing normally depends on the game, but let's talk about the  laziest approach to this: this number is your damage that gets directly  multiplied/added to your strength stat and its speed is a flat number.

This  makes sense for a game and is easy to understand for the player and  relatively easy to integrate in a rpg-game as a developer... but this is  only excusable because of the gameplay aspect... What do I mean by  that? Welp... Let's take oversimplified concepts and combine them with  reality and see what happens...

1.:  In reality if you punch something only two factors matter about the  force of the punch: your weight and how ""fast you can get your fist to  move"".(F=ma) How would you get more force behind your fist? Welp... you  would need to accelerate your fist even faster then before. In game you  would invest points in strength. But if you try to combine these two  things... there suddenly exists a problem... why? Because acceleration  or speed is bound to the agility stat under normal circumstance... So  how would you increasing your strength reflect in reality? Would your  fist get heavier? Would the MCs mass get big enough to get its own  gravity field over the course of the story?

2.:  Energy... Where does it come from? Where does it go? If someone can  move a whole building by simply ground pounding your m...ansion how much  would this person need to eat?

3.:  How does the character hold back? How would old technology like a phone  not get turned to dust by a guy capable of bench-pressing mars, when I  struggle to not get covered in egg-juice when cooking?

This all is just lazy writing... but to be honest this is still bearable. It becomes unbearable the moment this happens tho:

FLAT  FUCKING CHARACTERs... This is a problem with manga outside of  video-game manga, but it feels it is especially true for them(, maybe  because of the MC that is so often just a self-insert character...)

Shortcuts...  If you have something setting your main character apart from the  rest... why the fuck is it luck of all things? And then this luck is to  be seen as some kind of achievement? WTF? Oh, this guy is so  incredible... He beat a lvl. 100000+ as lvl. 0.5 with a cool dagger  shooting half naked mermaids in golden armor... in half a hit... while  trying hard not to fart because he has explosive diarrhea...(the last  part only exists because the author thinks he needs some kind of  tension...)

If you can't make a  genius protagonist... ok, but don't make it so, that every else is a  moron that cooks their diner in their chamber pot...

This  would be all I can think of right now... Summarized the biggest problem  with video-game manga/comics in general is the lack of scale, effort  and sense... There are good ones like ""Survival Story Of A Sword King In  A Fantasy World"", ""Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken"" ""Kumo Desu ga, Nani  ka"" and so on, but those really are like diamonds in a pile of shit: You  can see them, pick them out and admire them for what they are, but the  stench just doesn't disappear...

In anime and manga, we normally see two types of villains.
Or it's the same villain from the beginning until the end, or we have a big villain for each arc, and in the second case sometimes the villain returns as an ally or something similar (Vegeta, for example).

But on Inuyasha, we have an approach closer to what we see in comics.
Naraku, Seshomaru and Kikyo are villains that come and back for multiple arcs, and sometimes those arcs are even self-contained.

There are more examples of manga like that? Note, that I'm not talking about something like Itachi. Despite his coming back from another arc, Akatsuki's saga is a rush down and his earlier appearance acts like a preview.",False,manga,1706458914.0,1ad6b7c

In order to prevent this, a team of ghouls, creatures, angel and demon, etc were called to disguise themselves as the boys classmates to learn about why he was so sad and how to fix it so he can be happy and to prevent the world from ending.

 Over the course of the webtoon they all bond to the greyscale and depressed boy and learn that he came from neglect (something about a birthday party?) and they all had to emotionally connect with him for him to open up.

Can you help me find the title of this manga?,,"I've read this years ago and I just suddenly had a photographic memory of the cover so I wanted to check on it again.

It is about a high school boy, who has a weird/boring personality (as seen by his classmates). The manga's genre is comedy, school life, and I guess slice of life since it tackles about his daily life. Speaking about his daily lives, he is part of a baseball team, also has a hobby of watching rakugo, and he seems to have no friends at the start. Then I remembered, romance was not really its main focus but I think there was a girl who came to like him when she got to become somewhat friends with him but it happened wayy later in the story. I think what I really liked about the protagonist is his super straightforward and serious personality that most of the time I find very funny.

So that's the gist of the manga. Can someone help me?? I just badly want to read it again but I really can't find it even on the reading history of a manga site that I frequently visit.",False,manga,1706452814.0,1ad42gp

Isekai where MC not OP but survive because of that ?,,"I remember this isekai that mc was just normal high school boy.

I think all of them die in bus accident in field trip. They then went into another world , the goddess tell them to go into guild and become adventurer.

There are many people from mc world like from another school that die, got transported like mc.

MC did not have any good skills, all his classmate then went separate way forming party and mc was left alone. I remember MC was transported late, so all his classmate already gone because they got transported earlier than him.

MC then decided to survive with his trash skills, meet with his former classmate, a fat boy who now become merchant. He seems was mc friend, the fat boy also talentless like mc and left alone.

Later he found out his abilities was not suited for combat, but was amazing as merchant. He then help mc and he tell mc, majority of their classmate already die after being adventurer.

MC was shocked because most of them get good skills right ? the fat boy then told mc, good skills does not mean easy adventure. There are many adventurer overestimating themselves, delve into dangerous dungeon without any preperation and wiped, there are adventurer that cannot withstand the pain and injury when they fight monsters and die. Basically he told mc all adventurer was normal school students, they don't have experience , cannot handle the horror of death, and any painful/injury when fighting monsters.

The fat boy then tell MC have strong mental power, mc also very careful person and slowly climb his way rather than rushing it, and that's why he managed to survive this long. After that mc bide the fat boy farewell for another adventure.

I remember he later save a goddess that was sealed in the shrine, she was deemed as evil god or something like that, while the goddess say she was not evil god, she kinda lose the war against other god and sealed. The goddess was weak and decided to stick with MC and tell him, if he become her servant and worship her, slowly she can regain power and ask MC to find many people to worship her.

I think MC agree because the goddess give MC some blessing, it was kinda weak blessing but will become stronger when MC helped the goddess find people to worship her and spread her name.

Anyone know the name ?

There's a dude who gets isekaid to three different worlds - I don't remember if he loops between them involuntarily or voluntarily, but he somehow travels between them.

One world is a fantasy world, has a dragon that's terrorizing the people, and a holy sword in a stone for a hero to pull out.

One world is a sci-fi world, with advanced tech like laser guns and teleporters, and has a meteor heading towards the planet about to destroy it.

One world is probably a fantasy, has an evil wizard who has an unbreakable defence and wants a strong challenger to face him, if not he'll do something evil (i think)

The main character resolves the conflicts by >! taking a laser gun from world 2, killing the dragon with it, removing the sword from the stone by holding him and teleporting himself to the side using a teleporter from world 2.

Just finished the boxer and hot damn the music in that last fight was amazing....,,"The boxer is a webtoon manwha/manga I started reading a while back and thought I figured I'd give it a try since most people kept recommending it to me. Gotta say this, I really enjoyed the story quite a bit. All the battles, character arcs, and how the coach developed was really dope. 


I gotta say the music in the boxer was really good. I've seen some webtoons do this more and more and I'd love for manga to have music and voice acting if they wanted. Honestly I think it'd be a really good implementation and the option to remove it simply if people wanna read it at their pace instead of playing catch up could be a really good option. People that wanna enjoy it with voice acting and music, here you go. People that wanna enjoy it with music, here you go. People that wanna enjoy it with their own music and just wanna read, here you go. Etc etc etc. I also think stuff such as audiobooks could help elevate manga in the music and voice acting department. Manga I feel has soo much untapped potential I'd love to see it grow. Within a physical medium and online. 


Anyways, all of this is to say, read the boxer. The manga feels like an anime with the song that played in the ending and the pacing is extremely solid. Heavily recommend it at least for the action.

Killing the girl. This makes other mc really angry. There's a time skip and he's really chiper like the girl was. Another character points out that him acting like her wasn't gonna bring her back. He's also carrying her head around in a bag?

Please help me find the name of this manga,,"I appologize if it's not 100% accurate because it has been a few years I had read it. 

It starts with the MC, witnessing the execution of his whole party by the power in place (The kingdom and the nobles). He's executed or is left for dead afterwards. He then comes back to exact his revenge on those who betrayed him.

In his journey, he found out the ugly nature of his ennemies and the hidden horrors they had done :

\- One wiped out an entire village because people rooted for the MC and his companions. He remembers about a young boy but when he came back to the village, everything was destroyed and he found a trace of what belonged to the child.  
\- One secretly used people as guinea pigs for horrible experiences in the name of ""science"".  
\- One even lured people to kill them and serve their meat in dinner. I think this noble has a family who partakes in this.  


The MC can be terrifying against his foes but has kept his good heart. He was genuinely heartbroken to learn what happened to the people he met and cared.

Need Help Finding a Manwha (completed short story about a girl learning the love of family),,"I desperately need help finding a manwha about a girl who felt ignored and left out in her own family.

The MC was later reunited with her real family and learned how much they love her and how much she loves her family as well. 

The most distinctive information I know is that it is a VERY short webtoon (less than 10-15 chapters), set in modern time Seoul, and it was so unbelievably heart jerking. I believe the MC had a little brother as well.

Forgotten Title: Mc goes back in time? Or transmitigates?

So this might be a manga instead of a novel with how I remember stories, so I might be completly wrong, all I remember was the MC woke up and went hunting people he knew were strong, and he had some sort of dark arts power I thought it was necromancy but I can't seem to find it if its that.

This is from ""Kill The Hero"", I thought it might be this because of the mask I remember the MC had a mask that he used to hide his face when he went to hunt right after coming back, thats why I think it might be a manga maybe someone know art like this?

Ah I need to say this is all i remember so I think I either stop reading after or this is a middle of some arc (hope not or it's impossible to find),

I believe this was righ at the start, like it starts out with him spawning in the middle of a street and being attacked by some gang with some dark power, and he goes on attacking them wiping them out, and finding the leader, he starts using the mask, AH there were scrolls I think he got a scroll for fireball or something so there was magic of some sort, this picture of ""Kill the Hero"" really is how my imagination saw it or how I saved it.",False,manga,1706375935.0,1acfs7u

   * I absolutely can not relate to these types of charcters. They are like babies, in a sense everything is handed to them or everything goes their way. I can not connect to a character that has no struggles or conflicts.
* Goody two-shoes MC
   * MC is too positive and optimistic that it becomes incredibely overbearing and cringey.
* The girls/female characters are shallow and fall for MC for the most shallow reasons
   * MC befriends one of the FMC and then the FMC say ""I don't know why, but my heart is throbbing uncontrollably""
* To much comic relief (not sure if it is the right word)
   * Think of an MC that's in a dangerous situation with a dragon, then he tosses a stick which causes the dragon to chase it and say woof. After that, they become BFFs.
   * Sure comic relief is fine, but to much of it or in ""dire"" situation is pretty ""lame"".
* Good character development, plot, story telling and world building
   * I hate manga that rely on dumb-thicc female characters or harems as to compensate for their lack of or poor, character development, plot, story telling and world building.

Non curse users and domain expansion from Jujutsu kaisen,,"
I am up to latest chapter but i want to understand these situations 

Does Domain expansion effect non curse users 

There are 3 situations 

1- toji vs Geto female barber he got hit but destroyed her in her domain

2- Toji vs Dagon where he absolutely wrecked the daylight out of him but he wasn’t hurt with all the shit thrown at him

3- Maki vs Naoya she just one shot him but wasn’t affected by the 24 frame rule",False,manga,1706339611.0,1ac5567
Help finding manga by vague description?,,"Found someone describing a manga/manhwa, without name, and wanted to find it and try it myself. Description goes like this:

* Begins as relatively standard ""school class in another world"" issekai
* MC was left behind (?) and had to survive as a solo
* Found a cursed bracelet that didn't give any noticeable change in stats but ""paired"" him with one of his classmates, another outcast
* Bracelet forces them to stay together by reducing the stats if they are not nearby
* Develops as slice with two characters de facto living as a family, even if they don't see it like this
* Harem?

The MC of the game is a two faced bitch who keeps lying about the FL. The prince character dumbed her. I think she has parts of the character's memories and I think she pursues either the villain or dark character I can't remember which he was. It was set in a school. It was COLORED. Definitely. I remember he had black hair and was buff. And there was this scene where she and the Love interests had to save the MC from this wizard guy who kidnapped here and made them go through these weird puzzles and the prince relived the scene where he broke up with her. There was also a scene where the villainess was supposed to push her off a cliff but instead she saved her and ended falling instead. Does anyone know the title?

Sports manga - substitutions,,"Potentially niche topic, but I was curious if there were substitutions in sports manga/anime that people distinctly recall being hype/cool. Imo in intense games in sports manga the subs are always a really fun aspect, usually they shift the entire flow of the game and it's always cool seeing the tactical decisions and their resulting explanations, as well as letting more of the roster play. Some I think of are:

Blue Lock (Chapter 128) >!Reo and Hiori subbed on in the U-20 match. Really fun seeing how they subbed to adapt to the current game state, and it was really nice seeing how the game state shifted.!<

Kuroko no Basket (Chapter 186) >!Subbing on Furihata was really unexpected given that he had never done like anything the entire series. Thought it was really cool how he wasn't suddenly buffed but him being less good than the rest was actually the point by slowing down the flow of the game to let the team get their heads back on straight!<

This one family had a dad who was I think the right hand to the Leader of Dragons council and went to meet with him. One of the dragons on the council was evil and used some sort of elder tree magic or something to kill the other dragons and create dragon killing mosnters or smth. The family had two kids and the ran away. They ended up on some base where there were these monster with red crystals or eyes that would kills humans i think. I remeber two books/parts came out and the first one showed a girl in a coma and she suddenly wakes up. The second part went back in time to show how she went into a coma or vice versa.

"Looking for name of manga about a girl who goes through a lot of rooms to reach the human world, while a demonic creepy ass creature tries to stop her",Bibliomania,"HELLA SPOILERS 

I saw a video about this manga where the story was about a girl who was lowkey alien or something and she was living in a room with a number attached and she read about humans + the real world and wanted to go there but first had to go through a bunch (a few hundred maybe? i remember there being around 400) while some creepy looking creature accompanied her being like ""u sure u wanna go?"" and each room had a different theme.

And she flew past most of them no biggie but then one of the rooms was kinda emotional I think it was about a family where she almost got stuck but abandoned them anyways. Each time the girl went through a room she looked more gross-looking and at the final room she was covered in fungus and had like a tentacle arm and missing an eye.

Then when she passed the final room the disgusting stuff peeled off like a lizard shedding its skin and she looked normal like she was at the start? I think the manga started with a B and I don't think its NSFW because I saw the parts from all over the story on youtube and it was pretty popular (100k-1M views ish).

BTW lemme know if I did something wrong with submission because the rules were kinda confusing.",False,manga,1706327985.0,1ac1u49

Got a Kindle paperwhite for some manga,,"I tried out the free trial with kindle unlimited but not too sure if i'll hold on to it much longer, it seems to focus more on actual novels than manga which i wasn't too aware of.   


Now i found a great couple of mangas, Flowers of Evil and i especially enjoyed Happiness and didn't mind paying for the last couple digital volumes whatsoever.   


He's got other work on there but for about 6 volumes its around $40 for a couple nights of reading.   


Does anyone have any experience with   Shuzo Oshimi and perhaps other authors who write in a similar style. I've not bought any physical mangas since the DB paperbacks but they take up so much room i've got them currently in storage! So i thought the kindle could be a great way to sample stuff out and perhaps buy once i know i'm enjoying it.   


Any suggestions would be amazing, especially while i've still got my Kindle unlimited subscription but eh there's nothing besides Oshimi's work that really appealed to me. I like the surreal and almost eldritch tones in the visuals on Happiness, it was genuinely a great read for me and i recommend it for anyone who's yet to :)   


It's my first post here so apologies if i've broken any rules enquiring about this. I just thought the best place to hit would be the Manga reddit after seeing another fellow a year back got some assistance.   


I thought maybe mentioning the artist i was really interested in could even narrow it down to exatcly the type of styles i'd like. I sincerly appreciate your time and patience reading this novel on its own here. Many, Many thanks.

Help in finding the title of this manga similar to Tower of God and High-Rise Invasion,,"I’m still searching for the title of this manga!

So, this was back in 2014-2015 somewhere around there. I read a manga online and I absolutely loved it, but I can't remember the name of the title or author/artist; and I'd really like to go back and reread it! So, it's got a similar plot to High Rise Invasion and Tower of god. Basically, the main character is kidnapped and wakes up in a room. There's an earpiece in his ear and he is told if he doesn't cooperate with the game, he will die. He is also told that if he tries to escape or rip out the earpiece, it will explode. The game has a live audience that the MC can hear through the earpiece and the audience even makes bets and don’t realize that the “game” isn’t just a reality tv show. The object of the game is to reach the top of the highest floor in the building and be the last one standing/ survivor. I don't remember much but he goes through a battle of morals because some of the people he encounters are normal people just like him and he doesn't want to cause harm to them. While other people are just out to kill anyone that they encounter. I don’t remember much about the other characters he meets besides this one girl who shared her story of being bullied in school to a point where she tried to h@ng herself in the girls bathroom but failed and instead ended up in the game. I remember the Mangaka/author never finished the series, but they were kind enough to write out the rest of the story, so you do find out what happens at the end, but I don't exactly remember what happens.",False,manga,1706303759.0,1abt68e

I did some research and found out that the name of the character appears to be Shiragasane (白襲 written in Japanese). I found out the origin of the figure on the website of MyFigure Collection. BUT ALSO FOUND OUT that this character has a manga... And I know is weird because it seems to be a H-rated manga (lol) but I would like to see the origin of this thing LMAO.  
Also, is there some website with more pictures, or it is being sold anywhere I would like to know.  
I wanted to do this research because neither of the comments of interest could tell where was she from and there is almost nothing about this character on the internet but only what I found so far. That's why I am committed to doing the investigation myself. But I would appreciate a little help mostly because I do not understand Japanese.

Thank you for your time and I appreciate any help!

Need Help to find a manga!! Plz!!,,"So, few years ago, maybe around 2015 I read a manga with three main characters 2 boys and 1 girl. I think there was a love triangle as well (at the beginning at-least. But by end all 3 mc's are friends). They all go to school or college but manga is mainly focused on their personal lives. 

So the first boy tranfers to the school/college of other 2 mc's, belongs to not so rich family, can't afford to dye his hairs so bleaches it instead. (Probably: He only lives with his mother I.e. single parent household). 

The second boy belongs to a rich family, wears cool outfits and drives a cool bike, while wearing high-heels(yeah the female one) but he's straight. 
His father is businessman or businessman+m@fia. He also carries armaments and there's few scenes of delinquency in manga.
(Probably: There's a scene where he picks up the female mc from street and takes her on his bike for a ride.)

Can't remember much about the girl, but she is conflicted between the two at the start. And probably in the last panel 
she's crying or says some sad quotes.

There's one more thing, the manga could be Korean or from Korea-influenced author, can't remember it being a web-toon or manhwa though.

Please please it'd be great help if anyone could find it, as each time I remember it I try to find it, and I've been looking for it for years now, since 2019.",False,manga,1706291035.0,1abo5qm
