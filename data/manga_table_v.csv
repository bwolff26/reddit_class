Which quote / manga character has inspired you the most ?,," I'm currently pondering this question.

For me, achieving such a high level of goodness is likely the ideal to strive for.

Beet the Vandal Buster Volume 2 + English Volume 13-17?,,"Big fan of this series, been trying to collect it for some time. Was wondering if there are any other Beet fans out there. 

The series went on hiatus in 2006 and was like that for 10 years due to the artist's failing health. They came back in 2016 and since then have released volumes 13-17. Doesn't seem VIZ is interested in picking up the series again for the west which breaks my heart. Maybe if enough of us draw attention to it they might change their mind.

This shit was so fucking hype at times and it was seriously one of the better sleeper shonen hits of the early 2000's. I can't express how much I loved it. 

I've tried collecting it and I'm getting close to having all the volumes but I've hit a snag. I have every English volume that was released but volume 2 is so elusive. No matter where I look I always find the other volumes but not #2 unless it's for a stupid price with high shipping rates. Any idea why this is? Did they just not print that many of that volume?

"What is required reading to understand what ""Shonen"" is?",,"Hello,

A lot of times when I see people discuss the weirder or unique tropes in anime/manga/manhwa/manhua, I see the word ""shonen"" thrown around often, like ""oh this is typical of a shonen anime"" or ""he is a shonen protagonist"". I tried looking up definitions online, but they come off as too dry or mechanical to really give me a solid feeling on what distinguishes a ""shonen"" from any other kind of story. There is a lot of fighting, sure, but lots of genres that aren't shonen have fighting too, so that definition doesn't really distinguish it very well.

So, I wonder what is the recommended corpus of anime/manga/manhwa that best conveys the distinguishing features of Shonen in its rawest form, so I can get a better grasp on what it means beyond the official definition.

Some sources have told me that Shonen traces its origins back to the 16th century Chinese novel *Journey to the West*, which I find very surprising. I've heard of *Journey to the West*, but I've never associated it with the distinguishing tropes of Asian media nowadays. It always came off to me as a typical classic myth, one that fits right at home with Western literature like *The Golden Fleece* or *The Labors of Hercules* or *The Quest for the Grail*, none of which are typically considered Shonen.

**EDIT:** I hope it isn't too late to clarify that I mean Battle Shonen, which is a genre. I don't mean the demographic. ",False,manga,1707328190.0,1al8x2l

Does anyone happen to know the title of this manga?,,"Hey community,

I'm searching for a short manga I read on the internet a few years ago. I loved the atmosphere and would love to dive into it again. Here's what I can remember:

It's set in a dystopian future where all of humanity has become androids, suffering from this condition. They are obsessed with becoming human again.

The story follows a human boy, probably the last of his kind, on his quest for survival in an android city where everyone is hunting him to acquire parts or all of his body.

There's an android that help to defends and hide him. This android looks like a detective or something and is the secondary character of the story.

As the story progresses, the chase becomes more intense, and the boy is convinced he needs to turn into an android as well to defend himself. Meanwhile, his android protector tries to convince him not to do it.

In the end, >!the boy surrenders himself to the android boss of the city, wanting to gain power. The android boss sees an opportunity to become human again, so they attempt a transfer. The manga ends on a cliffhanger, but it's somewhat implied that the android boss died and the boy is now the new android boss.!<

"stuff similar to ""The Lone Necromancer""",,"I know this is pretty much a Solo Leveling clone. those arent the aspects im looking for more of though. although i dont necessarily want to avoid them, im more looking for the following aspects.

1. MC isnt the strongest. in this, he's definitely OP. but so are other characters.
2. Other characters still grow and develop.
3. The characters are developing the world around them (building communities, clans, etc)
4. MC is not ""chosen"" or special. they had the same opportunity as everyone else, and either worked hard or got lucky.

OP MCs seem to be the most popular for a lot of stuff right now, but its always been boring to me. ive found a few good ones where they develop the characters well, but very few actually take the time to do it. any suggestions that might be enjoyable?

others ive read and really enjoyed.

The image, roughly translated, says this:

>This is FANZA doujin support, thank you for your continued support

>Thank you very much for registering your work.

>We apologize to the circle, but

>In accordance with the copyright owner's wishes,

>We are refraining from handling works that parody the following elements.

>■Parody element: Frieren at the Funeral

>We would like to inform you that due to the reasons above, the publication status of the work in question has been suspended

>Thank you for your continued support of FANZA Doujin.


Truth be told, I don't know if this is newsworthy enough for the subreddit, it's just something you don't see too often nowadays, at least for bigger series. I don't know if it’s limited to R18 doujinshi, but considering FANZA is the only place we know of that's been hit with this, it could be. And I don't know if the copyright holder, Shogakukan, is the one pushing for this, or the author.

I'm uncertain if other distributors are affected",False,manga,1707243837.0,1akgldt

2. This tech has a core that it runs from/like a battery and if destroyed, it deactivates
3. There's a fighting competition where they fight, and at some point they are on a floating island that starts breaking and falling out of the sky
4. There's a female character with tentacle/octopus powers and she is quite strong
5. There is a character who can fly using tech in his shoes, I believe and he uses explosives as well
6. There is a character who has a power where a dragon type creature hides underground and that's where the core is. He is apparently a murderer or the son of a murderer.

The front cover was a cliche big booba woman but she is a fox girl and has red hair?? I thought at first it was a slice of life but no it was modern day fantasy superpowers kinda genre/gimmick. The MC was a dude who was a completely normal guy until he met this woman in distress and decided to take action by literally slamming a dude's head with a fire extinguisher (I am just explaining this in memory of the chapters I can still remember and this is just coming out of my ass so im sorry if im wrong).  


They regrouped at his house, the woman decided to live rentfree with him (damn) although he was kind of opposed to it. Cant remember the rest but I remember him dying and turning into another version of himself that has super powers similar to Black Flash in JJK it having black and red colors but evil, until such time the fox woman convinced the evil version of himself to come back to his original body that was stuck in the bathtub..? iirc, when he revived he had new super powers that were more blue than red and was now considered an orphan since the public records counted him as deceased.

what is the ratio of mangas b&w to colored ones?,The plural of manga is manga.,"i don't know if i construct my title right. i just wanna know how vast the colored mangas are in today's market. like do the so called popular (old popular and new popular) mangas do already have colored version? i wanna know what's the percentage. 

i'm planning to get my very first ereader and one of its use is for reading manga. i can't decide yet if i'd go for a colored version or a b&w one. colored version ofcourse is great but it has its cons too. being more pricier than b&w, lowbats faster, noteciable ghosting when page flipping, etc. honestly, i could live with the cons, it's just that if it's worth considering unknowing how many colored version of mangas available in the market and the additional 30% cost than the b&w. if there are a few available colored mangas now, say only 20% available, then i'd choose the b&w one",False,manga,1707209552.0,1ak5eq9

He meets her again after some years pass and is still in love with her so he invites her to see his last match as a boxer telling her that if he wins he wants to tell her something/confess. She shows up for the match and of course he loses, so then he packs up all his stuff and goes to her house to leave a letter on her doorstep before he presumably leaves town.

Berserk is my favourite series now.,,"So my taste is basic but my favourite series (both anime and manga) for well over 8-9 years was Naruto.

After I bought and sunk 700 hours into Elden Ring, I decided to pick up Berserk fully as I wanted to see why Miyazaki was so inspired and by god I’m so sorry I didn’t get into it sooner.

This series cleared Naruto for me. Absolutely cleared. I’ve always said the reason I liked Naruto so much was how much the characters and their stories meant and related to me, and good lord all it took was the first chapter of Deluxe Edition 1 and I was immediately blown away.

The world building the character development the ART STYLE everything is perfect. 

Guts as a character is something I could make a whole post about on its own, cuz there isn’t a way I could come close to doing his writing Justice.

Find This manga 🗣 please 😓,,"I got caught on reading this manga I can't for the life of me fine

But the concept is pretty cool

A Dad who is a push-over because he's too Nice, being used by every one 
With his daughter one day she took him away from a man that was about to use her dad's name for no good. 
Later the same day, that same guy tracked  them down and tried to come after the nice guy Daughter 

He ended up dieing protecting her-

After death he awoken in a field of flowers along with a few other random people who also died 

Long story short they all have a second chance to come back to life the moment b4 they died all they have to to is reach the top of a mountain in a shrine 
Only problem is it's a lot of demons and monster that are hidden in the forest  when they get killed they wake up in the flower garden again

another thing would be mangas that are very gothic and dark too, with vampires and stuff.

I actually tried watching the show when I was a kid, but got bored of it really fast, so I quit. I thought “I was just a kid, there’s no way I could form a cohesive thought then,” so I picked up some volumes and tried reading it. Twice. I got bored both times pretty quickly. I couldn’t make it past the part where they go through a forest or something during the ninja exam thing. It just didn’t feel fun to read. Compared to even One Piece, this felt like a slog. Later on in One Piece, there are often parts that feel really slow as well, but not that bad during the beginning. I probably will try reading Naruto again, because I heard shippuden is good.

The reason for this thread's existence is the fact that both requests and suggestions became kind of stale. It's supposed to bring out more manga that is not RTed or recommended. Also, it's quite useful for the discussion of not so current titles.

Also, not a rule or any kind of criticism, the more interesting part is not the list of the stuff you read, but your impressions of it.

The horizon,,"This is one manga I think everyone needs to read, no matter what sort of person you are or demographic you’re from. I read it a few years ago but for some reason rereading it has changed me more than I thought it would. I think because of the state of the world right now, I can understand the message behind the manga a lot more better now. 

So it revolves around two children, a boy and a girl in amidst a war. The boys mother is shot and killed so he starts walking. All he does is walk. Until he reaches a bus to rest. When he wakes up, he finds a girl hiding in the bus with him. They stare at each other for a while until they hear gunshots. That’s when he grabs her hand and they run until they reach a road. They start walking again until they meet a man. He’s a bit weird, at least to the boy. The girl seems to like him though. The man starts following them so the boy comes up with an escape plan which fails. They try again but by then the girls already formed a small bond with the man so she doesn’t want to leave him alone. Unfortunately, it’s not the best decision because the man tries to rape the girl. The boy stabs him and they run until they’re kidnapped. They got shot at by a man in a suit who rescues them but you soon find out he’s not a nice man. Or maybe he is, it’s really all down to your own interpretation. They start walking again and then you get a flashback to the girls background. She was the sole survivor of a group travelling on the bus she was introduced in. They all passed away from a contagious disease except one, a man who was shot at. The thing about this manga is that it focuses on the innocent. All those lives just forgotten. They lived on this earth, they were once alive and would have lived. Innocent people don’t start War’s so why do they pay that price? I cried so many times reading this shit. The boy and the girl keep walking until they reach the end of the road. That’s when they find another pair of children. The boys both raise their guns to each other and it’s this scene this is so impactful in my opinion. Like y’all don’t understand. They’re children raising guns at each other. I think I kind of just waffled a lot but I’m not going to ruin the end. I can’t do that.

[spoilers] Saikano thoughts + Overarching themes?,,"Hi y'all, I just finished reading Saikano and i'm trying to get my thoughts together.

It's a love story in the midst of a war, that much is clear -- so it's juxtaposing the lovey-dovey of a teenage romance and the grittiness of a huge tragedy. 

But I'm trying to think about all the little themes, threads, and storylines here.

**Being a Weapon**: Chise is a weapon, and struggles with her sense of ""duty"" to her country and the individualism that comes with teenagehood. She wants a boyfriend, a childhood, a teenage romance, things that are very personal -- but the duty to her country, and how everyone relies on her to save their lives will sometimes outweigh that.

And yet, in the manga there's one part where she chooses instead to go on a date with Shuji (the night he cheats on her) and the soldiers are mortified that she'll leave the Kanto region without any aid and let the Japanese soldiers die. She tells them it doesn't matter, that the Japanese people are just people who were born in the same country as her, and that whether the enemy dies or the Japanese soldiers die, they're all strangers to her.

So we have a bit of a theme about the pointlessness of war as well.

**Infidelity**: Akemi likes Shuji, someone who is clearly not available as he's dating Chise. But when she learns they've ""broken up"", she immediately goes to confess to Shuji, both directly and indirect (""why don't you ask me out?"", even if its played off as a joke). 

Then there's the whole Fuyumi arc, where Shuji can't forget ""his first"" and cheats on Chise. Both Chise and Tetsu (Fuyumi's husband) are off at war, away from their spouses. It seems to me that the manga implies that cheating is inevitable when your spouses are away at war, considering it happens to both Chise and Tetsu? What do you all think? (I disagree with this but my argument is that it's what *the manga* is trying to say)

**Complacency**: Shuji, and everyone in the small Hokkaido town, really -- all take up so many pointless things in the middle of a war. The boys are always talking about tits or ass and the girls are giggling all the time, talking about shonen jump comics, etc -- meanwhile Japan, even Sapporo, are being absolutely leveled. They really take for granted their safety and don't realize that their safety isn't guaranteed. It isn't until the major earthquake that any of them feel at the mercy of anything at all.

Can include color Japanese manga too. It's just tedious for me to write ""I like manhua and manhwa"" or ""I like Chinese and Korean comics"". And manacc would be more inclusive as it would include color Japanese manga and multi-national comics with ""made in Asia"" vibes. Also I don't like saying ""color comics"" because they make me think of Western made comics, or Marvel and DC comics. By using ""man"" before the ""acc"", it follows the tradition of ""man"" + ""ga/hua/hwa"", so people who would see ""manacc"" may easily associate it with the popular term ""manga"" but will know that it's not Japanese B&W manga.",False,manga,1707042162.0,1aikw8c

I think they were friends since high school, where the dark-haired friend was popular. I think he had thoughts like ""I'm surprised he talks to me when he's so popular with everyone especially the girls"" and stuff. In one of the chapters I think they played some sport together and went to the shower room after, where A took a peek at B's body. Once B got out, A got off to the thought of B's jacked body, and afterward, B was like ""What took you so long? You weren't jerking were you?"" I think at one point during that exchange B was flirting and there were signs he also liked A.

Ofc, it being smutty, there were parts with A getting off in the bath in his apartment. I can't remember if he lived with a roommate or whatever but I think another guy did engage sexually with him.",False,manga,1707023978.0,1aig93r

Manga ID help.,abyss rage,"Hello! I’m trying to remember a manga I read a while ago but I completely forgot the name as well as most of the plot. 

All I can remember is that the main character has white eyes (pretty positive he’s blind) and white hair I think. Because he’s blind it made him a great fighter. His backstory is also fucking tragic if I remember correctly. I also faintly remember a scene in the manga where he was trying to save his childhood friend (?) from a villain who led him into a trap (I think). 

The artwork in the manga is also very detailed and interesting which makes me want to find the manga even more.

Looking for a specific BL manga - please help!!,,"This is the first time I'm posting on reddit, so I hope I chose the correct community. If not, I'm sorry in advance 🙈 

So, I've been searching for a specific manga I read years ago. I can't find it no matter what I enter in Google.
I only remember the beginning and that I liked it a lot 🥲

The setup was somewhat like this:
Our MC comes home from work or something and gets accosted in front of his building by his (I think) ex-boyfriend. The dude harasses him quite a lot and I think he was abusive in their relationship. Then the MC's neighbor turns up and the MC gets him to pretend to be his new boyfriend. (I'm not too sure about this, could be that the neighbor pretends without being asked.) They make out (I think) and the neighbor scares the ex away. The neighbor is actually straight but can't help falling for the MC. 
That's about all I recall.

1. So it's shown to us that there are no fantasy elements in this story, no body swap ever occured and it was all psychological. Then why does the komori hallucination in the end manage to touch Yori? Is that just metaphorical? She responds to it

2. I was under the impression the Komori persona was part of Mari all along and absorbed into her as one. Who is the voice that calls her name in the end when she's walking by the road where the stalking took place? I was thinking it would only make sense to be the Komori persona.

I'm looking for recommendations where a smart and savvy girl who transform into a gyaru, while maintaining, or at least keeping at a respetable level, her intelligence throughout the storyline. Ideally, I'm hoping for a series that isn't overly explicit (preferably not hentai), but can include elements of ecchi or be explicit (even hentai) but having a compelling plot.

To provide a clearer picture, I envision a scenario where a diligent class rep becomes intrigued by fashion, either due to external influences or pre-existing private interests. This character then embraces the gyaru lifestyle without compromising her intelligence, retaining her role as the class rep or continuing to showcase her intellectual prowess. 

Or other scenario where a Gal shows her intelligence in the same sense. 

Please note that my intention is not to stereotype. However, I've observed a common trend where gals are portrayed as less intellectually inclined, and I'm want to find stories that defy this convention.

Leon saß in seinem Auto und fuhr nach Hause von der Arbeit. Er war müde und gestresst. Er hatte einen langen Tag gehabt und er freute sich darauf, nach Hause zu gehen und sich auszuruhen.

Plötzlich sah er ein Licht auf der Straße vor sich. Er versuchte zu bremsen, aber es war zu spät. Das Auto prallte gegen das Licht und Leon wurde bewusstlos.

Leon wusste nicht, wie er in diese Welt gekommen war, aber er war entschlossen, herauszufinden, was los war. Er beschloss, sich auf eine Reise zu begeben, um mehr über diese neue Welt zu erfahren.

**Kapitel 3: Die Prüfung**

Leon reiste durch die neue Welt und traf viele verschiedene Menschen. Er lernte viel über die Geschichte und Kultur dieser Welt.

Eines Tages traf Leon auf einen alten Mann, der ihm erzählte, dass er ein Held sein sollte. Der alte Mann sagte Leon, dass er gegen den grausamen Dämonenkönig kämpfen musste, um die Welt zu retten.

Leon war erschrocken, aber er wusste, dass er die Aufgabe übernehmen musste. Er begann, sich auf den Kampf gegen den Dämonenkönig vorzubereiten.

**Kapitel 5: Die Schlacht**

Der Tag des Kampfes gegen den Dämonenkönig war endlich gekommen. Leon und das Team der Helden zogen in die Schlacht.

Eines Tages tauchte eine neue Bedrohung auf. Ein mächtiger Zauberer hatte sich erhoben und drohte, die Welt zu erobern.

Leon wusste, dass er die Bedrohung bekämpfen musste. Er stellte ein neues Team von Helden zusammen und zog in die Schlacht gegen den Zauberer.

Looking a Manga where a boy build his own guild,," 

Guys, does anyone know the name of a manga where a boy starts his own guild? I was watching it at Manga Recap but the next day, the video was deleted so I cannot remember the name of the manga  
So, I was watching a Youtube Manga Recap of the scene where a boy was hiring members (I forgot if he was a noble boy or not). He then posted a request saying he is looking for members. And I remember that the members still get paid despite not taking a quest and everyone was surprised with it. That's when a female swordsman or a female knight (her appearance she has a ponytail and wears a light armor, but I'm not 100% accurate) was interested. And when the boy was preparing his guild, the female knight appeared in front of the boy with the dragon she had just slayed and she told the boy that she's interested in joining him.  
And that's the scene that I remember as I was about to continue, the video got deleted.

PLEASE HELP ME FIND THIS MANGA,," 

Hello, Im looking for a romance/supernatural manga that I believe was either written in the 90s or 2000s, classic black and white artstyle also beautifully illustrated.

What I remember about the plot:

* The protagonist was a young beautiful girl around the age of 13 who used to be a model
* She had a proud character
* She moved to a seaside town with her family
* People at her new school where envious of her at the beginning but latter accepted her
* She met a boy who was her classmate who had magical powers connected with the sea, very big part of his character
* They became kind of friends/rivals/eachothers crushes
* There was a **big plot point** about a photographer who she used to work with wanting to do a nude/semi nude photoshoot with her. She agrees but her parents refuse, so she secretly goes to Tokyo for the shoot and the boy accompanies her.

Some other things I remember but I'm not actually sure if they're true:

* The title might contain some of these words: blue, spark/sparkling, clear, ocean, sky
* There is a scene where he either drags her or they full in water together
* I think it's completed but it's not really long, around 70 chapters",False,manga,1706923426.0,1ahk25b

name that manga,,"it's one I read awhile ago, about a dark haired girl who was adopted as the sister of the heroine (protagonist) re-incarnated into an otome she read as the villainess. Instead of bullying her sister, she loves her sister who dies fairly early in the manga. Main character leaves after the sister funeral and opens a restaurant in the city as a commoner, and the stage sets in which the heroine of the otome, a girl from the countryside who looks exactly like the villainess's younger sister, is introduced. Thus the villainess heads back with a prince for her debutantes and becomes the main character.

20th century boys ending,,"WARNING FOR SPOILERS

Hi, just finished 20th century boys and it became my favourite manga. I know there are ready tons of posts about this but I wanted to know other opinions on the ending.
SPOILERS ABOVE



I read it in the perfect editions but I don't really
know what to think about the ending. Which makes more sense more and is overall ""better"". Even though the original ending,  makes sense and it's much more simple, when the first friend dies in 2015 in the science lab, katsumata, the second friend becomes ""the new friend"". The second ending, the one that came into the perfect editions, Is a bit more complex, I think. Even though there are minor plots holes, it makes sense, for example, in the VR simulation, when they are in the science lab and fukubei is is hanging from the noose, the friend(katsumata, since he was the friend from the very beginning) tries to kill fukubei by saying: ""this is the truth"" and I don't really get why people hate on this ending so much.

Overall I think it's an incredible manga with very deep meaning and I want to hear out someone about the ending, since I'm still a bit confused.",False,manga,1706908738.0,1ahekdb

I am looking for ... ?,,"I am looking for a Manga or manwha, I am not sure what it is. Its been so long since I have read it, and I can barely recall much from it, so I apologize if what I mention below is not accurate. 

&#x200B;

It starts off by introducing the main character, hes supposedly supposed to be some average not rich worker, who is searching for girls on some "" online forum "". He reaches out to a girl and she doesnt reply till later. I believe he is sending out applications for females if they would like to have a master / submission relationship with him. He is reluctant that this girl messages back as she is pretty and young. They message back and forth and she is also very much into the whole scenario. There is a scene where they are texting and he mentions to her .. I believe .. that she can touch herself but she cant use her toys or pentration?.. or something...? She teases herself repeatedly and even uses the corner of a table? to edge her self before relieving herself. I cant remember too much about this but I laso recall a scene where he buys her a gift.. I think lingerie? and also they end up meeting at a coffee shop to official meet in person as it has always been through their phones. She gets turned on by the things they discuss.. I believe rules for the relationship? and she soaks the chair with her .. anyways. they leave the area and sit on a bench? and I believe he does things to her . . This is the extent of my knowledge on this.
