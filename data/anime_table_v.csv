Trying to find a old Ecchi anime,Help,"I’m trying to remember the name of an old Ecchi anime from when I was younger. I remember some key details from it too.

The main girl had pink hair

It was from the 2000’s 

It was a Ecchi Harem anime

It had the characters go to school

The first part of the opening episode had the pink hair girl had a panty shot and got angel wings

It had 1 episode where the main character was tied up and in his swim suit

Another episode where it was raining and the main character helped out another girl apart of the Harem

There was a trio of girls who were the antagonist who hated the main character 

And finally I believe there was a OVA where the main characters went to the where it was uncensored and you got to see everything. 

And also in that OVA too the trio of girls piloted a robot

For a while I thought it was called Girls Bravo but it just showed me Bravo Girls. Another show I thought it might be was Heaven's Lost Property but the animation was too good to be that. The animation in the show I’m looking for is like early to mid 2000’s anime where it looked shiny and flat, similar to looking like elfin lied (and also no it’s not Elfin lied either it wasn’t gory).

Hello everyone! I am Holofan4life. 

Welcome to the Paranoia Agent 20th Anniversary Rewatch discussion thread! 

I hope you all have a lot of fun <3 

S1 Episode 5 – The Holy Warrior

—- 

ANSWER TODAY’S QUESTION(S)

If you were transported to another world, which reaction would you more likely have: Maniwa's, or Ikari's?

Did you ever think we would get a video game episode out of this show?

Bonus) Who would win in a fight: Holy Warrior, God Warrior, or The Ultimate Warrior?

Bonus 2) With the two detectives being transported into a video game world, does this technically make the show now an isekai?

Tried watching The New World but Ive kinda tapped out midway, it just didnt click for me.
Of the recent ones Ive watched I think Shiki stuck with me the most. So Im looking for similar anime to that.

The animation shouldnt be too old or too weird style (laughing salesman). Action is fine but preferably mystery and thriller/supernatural.

Having trouble finding a good anime (I’m new to this medium) - can y’all recommend me something based on what I like?,What to Watch?,"Hey! So, the only anime/manga I love so much so far is Death Note - watched the anime a year ago, now reading all the manga.

Currently watching Tokyo Ghoul - I mean.. it’s good. Not great, not bad, just good IMO so far (finishing season 1). 

otherwise, I like:
- The Witcher (books)
- Harry Potter (both) 
- The Walking Dead (both comics & TV show)
- Game of Thrones (also read all 5 released books)

Recomend finished anime with OP MC,What to Watch?,"Hi there good people, i have watched quite a lot of anime lately and although i wibe with a lot of them (a lot of isekai, prog fantasy, OP MCs)  but im fed up with one or two seasons and neverending waiting. Recently i watched Arifureta wich i liked. Somewhat dickish OP MC (like shield hero season one) is nice food. But it is not finished. Like there is nothing with end. Isekai is basically never a finished show aside from old clasics like Magic night Rayearth or Hack.

So, recomend me some FINISHED (not canceled or on hiatus or Berserk) anime with OP MC, preferably with dickish personality but not necesary.  Can be fantasy, isekai, scify, whatever category Slime was.... i dont really care. 

Im kinda boomer in this.  In ye old times i feel like there were so many shows that told its story in season or two and now everything is Naruto (i love naruto but when i started it it was allmost over). I dont know how to navigate this anime climate. I did not watch much for a few years and its just copletely different climate now.

Thank you very much :)",False,anime,1707327845.0,1al8rzf

Recommendations for similar anime please?,What to Watch?,"Hi all!

Do you guys have any recommendations for Anime like these, and these reasons (doesn't have to be the same genre):

* **Solo Leveling**
   * Serious & dark (but not Shield Hero dark) beginning, undertone of mystery and intrigue of future events, fantastic art helps deliver on all of the above. There's also a real sense of progression for MC's power and story both.
   * Ofc the show is new with only a few episodes out, but it reminds me of Berserk of Gluttony but better (so far)
* **Apothecary Diaries** / **The Saint's Magic Power is Omnipotent**
   * Female MC that's not OP (in combat), emphasizing everyday stuff like research & studying & relationships with a budding romance, without being only about the romance either
   * A good, strong guy protecting the MC for that daww <3
* **World Trigger**
   * Just fantastic in every way, esp high internal consistency and logic behind every person & event, also an interesting story with progression

Also one last weird question: I just started watching Absolute Duo (not convinced so far but nvm that). In the first episode \[Spoilers: Absolute Duo s01e01\] >!the school forces the students to fight their partner, and only the winner gets admitted. I couldn't help but think: what if the MC had simply lost on purpose because: 1) the school lied and set those conditions to force the students to give their best so they could be measured for their potential, but were really going to allow admittance to both either way, or 2) the school really did use arbitrary, unreliable, even cruel methods to disqualify potentially brilliant students, in which case it didn't live up to its reputation and the MC would rather just take their skills elsewhere instead. Either way, from the MC's PoV losing would be the right choice.!<

Is there any anime where the MC openly stands up to and criticizes flawed systems and authorities regardless of consequences, but is also strong enough to be able to afford to, even force the systems and authority figures themselves to change for better in the end? So the story would revolve around that? I know this is a weird question, but this is something of a recurring pet peeve of mine about a lot of shows and games too where I wish some shows handled it like this! The Irregular at Magic High School kinda touches on this idea, but not really.

Thank you all in advance!

Edit: Oh and bonus points if it's available on Crunchy in Europe! Thanks!",False,anime,1707323758.0,1al73qc

Trying to find a old show.,Help,Ok I have been asking friends and acquaintances for years and still can't find this show. I'm 80% sure it was an anime and not a cartoon. It was on Cartoon Network (mid 90's-early 2000's). All I remember about the show is the characters would touch any kind of matter and it would break it down into different weapons. One guy had glowing spheres that floated around him and would launch at people. Another had a glowing sword that looked like a bar of light. Stuff like that. Does anyone have any recollection of this show? It's been driving me crazy for years 😂.,False,anime,1707318142.0,1al4xc5

"Deaf, HOH, CODA - What do we think about [A Sign of Affection]?",Discussion,"Would love to hear from fellow CODA about [A Sign of Affection] as that's where I fall, but I'd love thoughts from Deaf and HOH as well!

On the one hand, I love all of the Japanese signs, on the other, I feel conflicted about how Itsuomi treats Yuki. I showed my mom and she felt like he was rude to touch her so much and get up in her face, but also loved how he actively wanted to learn her language, and seems to be invested in actively using it with her.

She said Oushi is ""typical over protective hearie."" She could definitely relate to Yuki's family not knowing sign, as my grandparents (while incredibly progressive about it for their time in other areas) also never learned her language. I'd love to hear other opinions!!!

It's always amazing seeing deaf characters in media, I'm really enjoying this show. Big fan of how realistic certain things are. I know nothing about Japanese deaf culture, but I see enough similarities that the show kind of feels like home.",False,anime,1707314670.0,1al3nog

"Searching for something light hearted, romance story, slice of life, comedy",What to Watch?,"Hi guys, this is my anime list: [https://myanimelist.net/profile/perrycotto](https://myanimelist.net/profile/perrycotto)

Refently I saturated my favourite anime to watch and currently I‘ve binged Frieren both anime and manga, I have to say that i absolutely didn’t thought it could hook me so much, the animation is superb, character are well designed and their chemistry is great, I especially love how well it balances action, adventure and [Iyashikei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iyashikei)  vibes.

I‘ve taken this example because it encompass very well what I search in anime, something that is visually appealing (mushishi, mob psycho, bungou stray dogs, vivy fluorite song, nichijou, berserk the old one, ghost in the shell); has a solid engaging story that isn’t predictable unlike anime such as Black Clover or Shield Hero (my brain still hurts); has a certain level of attention for soundtrack and music (i don’t expect something as vivy fluorite, beck or the amazing Takt Op.).   


You will see that i’m missing a lot of classics like Code Geass but I really can’t stand that style of animation and sadly for me it’s a deal breaker even if the anime is good. I‘m not expecting bones, madhouse or mbappa level of animation every single episode, hell I’ve enjoyed Pop team epic, inferno cop and other weird anime because of their creativity and smart use of simple animation to deliver great story or great action / funny scenes. 

While i’ve said that i enjoy the [Iyashikei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iyashikei) genre I tend to get bored quickly as my level of attention has been dramatically abused by the fast paced and action packed genre. Masterpieces as Mushishi of Aria are surely great but I consume them very slowly and occasionally. 

Ideally I would search something with the story of Fruit Basket, the animation that can span from Great Teacher Onizuka (one of my favourite of all time, I’ve read everything from the author) to the much modern Heavenly Delusion (which was sadly a delusion), the comedy of Nichijou, Full Metal Panic or Golden Boy or Love is war.

I’m aware of great suggestions such as Yuru Camp, Place further than the universe, Toradora, Wonder Egg Priority, The Melancholy of... etc but for now i’m searching something else. 

I’m more than open to other suggestions of other genre the only condition is that i’m asking you your really favourite and best and most emotional anime the you hold dear.

thanks everyone !

New to Anime and I need Suggestions,What to Watch?,"I’ve seen AoT, Cyberpunk, Castlevania & Nocturne Isles, Naruto, and I’m currently watching JJK. I loved all of them, with AoT being my favorite of the bunch. 

I want to get into Anime more and I need some suggestions based on my preferences: 
- As you can tell from my list, I definitely lean towards action, but I am willing to watch a show with less action if the story is that good. 
- I prefer cool lore & world-building over anything else. 
- Please don’t roast me for this one, but I don’t like when most of the characters or the MC look like literal children, but are adults, it really throws me off. If just a couple characters are like that, then it’s fine.

Would you recommend/re-watch Highschool of the Dead?,Discussion,"Lemme explain.

Is a very entertaining anime. With a great production quality. And the journey the main characters do towards adulthood and responsibility, while embracing their emotions and their ups and downs, is something between great and amazing (still trying to decide one of them) There's so much to learn from it.

However, there's a ""but..."". Female characters are beautiful and that's Ok. But their outfits are totally objectifying, and even more many gratuitous situations. And every shot where they appear is just fan service. It isn't something that happens a scene or two. Cannot be skipped, is just everywhere.

For me it's a pity that an anime of this quality seems to be so addressed to male audiences. Hence the question. I'm not sure me (as a guy) would even feel totally comfortable re-watching it.

Ongoing Anime Hunt (All help is appreciated),Help,"MY FIRST POST

Okay, so I'll do this as best as I can. 

I was like 12, scrolling through animes as a 12 year old girl would on YouTube. 

I know there were better apps, not the point.

Anyways, anytime I ended up liking one, it was in Japanese writing so unfortunately I didn't understand. 
There was this one anime, where a female character was like on her home planet, and there was suddenly lots of fire. Lots of it. 

Fast forward she wakes up in this like giant done world thing in space with other humans she doesn't know, but all have some sort of powers as she. It seemed like they were learning to harness them. 

If you guys have any pics or ideas of what it could be I'd greatly appreciate it🥺🙏 I'm shitty at explaining things so I'm sorry but again thank you!",False,anime,1707295085.0,1akygdn

What do i even call this genre? / Any guesses to what anime this might be?,Help,"Hi! Im trying to remember some god awful anime i saw when i was a kid ... unfortunately i cant even type search words in to google images to try to trigger a memory because i have no clue what to call this genre...

Its a child male anime protaganist who's main antagonist is himself, aged up, as a teenager/young man. The two versions of him have different personalities in the same body, seperate awareness.( I know its Definitely not Yu-Gi-Oh, i would recognize the hair. ) This was just some generic looking black hair school uniform Anime guy. I dont really know what to call this trope or genre where i guess the main character has split personality or two souls in one body? Its not a writing trick to have the character talk to himself for exposition or mental issue like multiple personality disorder because when the older personality takes over it PHYSICALLY  changes the child's body into the older copy. Magic. Poof. 

Help me out here...?  What do i search for this kind of genre?  If memory serves right, maybe hes a vampire or something?  Does anyone have any guesses what it might be? There cant be that many anime where the main lead is two people in the same body.  

.... And saying that now, theres a ton that come to mind.. aaaa Its not bleach... Cant be inuyasha... Nothing mainstream. Probably. It would have to be a battle action series... I dont watch sol at all.  Please help and thankyou. Any guessses?",False,anime,1707294037.0,1aky7x7

What anime would be the best visual novel?,Discussion,"Imagine if an anime was adapted as a visual novel with all the visual novel effects, soundtracks, and most importantly, routes, letting you explore different options and what could happen. Some visual novels could incorporate some gameplay aspects too where how you perform can change outcomes.

What are some anime that would benefit from this? And please no boring answers like anime adapted from a visual novel (Clannad, Steins Gate, Fate, Higurashi, Danganronpa)

For me, a harem would be an obvious choice. Something like the **Quintuplets** would be nice to see the routes of each girl.

**Renai Flops** would be fantastic as a VN, especially with the twist so you can go different routes to see what they could do with the twist which I can't spoil.

Other than harem, I think Hyouka would be an amazing VN because of the different possible aspects, events, and maybe it could have a cool little detective minigame gameplay.

Shadows House would be amazing too for the same reasons.

Yuru Camp would be really boring but maybe they could pull it off like having stunning scenery or having different campgrounds as your routes would be really cool.

Saekano, mostly because it's parodying VN games.

Amagi Brilliant Park, would be a cool feature to see if you can save the park in time and have different routes to check out the different park aspects and stuff.

Komi and Hitoribocchi see how many friends you can make lol.

Re Zero and other time travel anime would be super cool too.

I really want to find more shows along that vein but I’m having trouble finding recommendations that actually have evolution paths. Rimuru going demon lord or spider becoming Arachne is awesome to me. Bofuri and other VRMMO like it, log horizon etc kinda fit the bill but I’ve watched a majority of them I feel like.

Do the big three deserve remakes? (Kai treatment),Discussion,"Kinda like how One Piece is getting that remake in the future, do bleach and Naruto deserve getting a remake as well? Compared to something modern like Demon Slayer that had pretty good pacing and no fillers, I personally think bigger shows that were made in the time of fillers should get at the very least a “Kai” version, if not a whole revamped remake. Like if Naruto had all filler cut out, was compacted into something easier to swallow, and had new shiny animation. Maybe that’s what studio Pierrot is gonna test out with those special episodes of Naruto they were making.

I guess this extends to anything with a lot of episodes really, not just the big three. Like detective Conan, Pokémon, Lupin the Third, ETC",False,anime,1707246655.0,1akhrq7

Help me find this anime.,Help,"I have a vague recollection of an anime I once saw on TV when I was a kid and would like to find where it was from.

There are 4 characters in the scene, all of them female. 3 of them seem to be ""evil"" with dark colors and the like and they're draining the energy of a 4th seemingly ""good"" character (bright colors). At one point, the background becomes red/orange and the three villains form a triangle with the victim in the center.

I also remember them transforming into butterfly like creatures, altough I can't remember whether is was just the villains, the victim or all of them.

Given I was a kid and I think it was around the time Rurouni Kenshin was on TV, it has to be late 90s early 2000s. I live in Belgium mind you, so it has to be aired outside of Japan and most likely has an English dub.",False,anime,1707229125.0,1akat1c

Can anyone help me indentify an anime I watched as a child?,Help,"Hi, I just remember this one specific scene from an anime I watched as a child, if someone could help me identify the name of the anime, that would be amazing. I think I was watching it around late 1990s early 2000s on the channel animax.

The protagonist is a girl who has magic powers. She's not a child but maybe a teenager. She had short dark hair. She has a best friend who's got longer hair and both of them have boyfriends.

The scene I remember is that she's on a call with her boyfriend and he's confessing his feelings to her, but she somehow astro travels to him. She can see him, but he cannot and that's when she discovers this new power. She's trying to tell him about her power and he's trying to confess his feelings.

Another scene I remember is that she tells this to her best friend and in the night she, her best friend, best friend's boyfriend and the protagonist's boyfriend meet by a hill. The protagonist conjures two flying carriages and they each go in one with their boyfriends taking in the night view of the city.

I've been looking for this anime for years, but haven't been able to identify the anime.

Committing to a big anime,Discussion,I have decided to watch One piece. I was wanting to watch an adventure anime.

As long as there's no romance I think that's good enough! So if you're kind enough, please drop some of your recommendations and thank you for the help!",False,anime,1707209820.0,1ak5guj
Anime Series in Limbo: Did you forget about these anime too?,Discussion,"I'm sure many of you have watched numerous anime series, and it's easy to lose track of some over time. We eagerly wait for new seasons, only to eventually forget about certain shows. I'd like to inquire about anime whose current status is uncertain, and, likely, they won't be renewed. As I was going through my list I was surprised by the number of shows I forgot about:

* No Game No Life (I know a lot of people didn't forget about this, but the studio did)
* Gosick (Mystery)
* Seitokai Yakuindomo (Depends on GoHands)
* Noragami
* Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress (Anime Original, So it depends on Wit Studio)
* Gakuen Babysitters (Wholesome)
* Nichijou
* Kono Oto Tomare (The music gives me goosebumps)
* How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom (The only isekai-harem anime that ain't mid)
* Barakamon
* Burning Kabaddi
* Gin no Saji (Silver Spoon)
* Demi-chan wa Kataritai (more satou sensei x takahashi sensei)
* Tanaka-kun is Always Listless
* Senryuu Shoujo
* D-frag!
* We never learn (We need the endings animated)
* Tokyo Ghoul (We only got the first season right? Yup! Season 2 isn't announced yet.)

Also, feel free to correct me if you have any news regarding the above anime.

P.S. I know some of the shows above have lost popularity or have poor sales. But still, I wish they had continued. Out of all these anime, I'm genuinely frustrated with Gosick as it was released during the ""2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami"" which was the most powerful earthquake in Japan (source: Wikipedia). So not a lot of people watched it and wasn't that popular. The author of the novels kept writing the books, so now I've decided to study Japanese to read them as they are not translated.

Edit: Ik Tokyo Ghoul has more seasons, I was just joking as I refuse to acknowledge the messy adaptation.",False,anime,1707209069.0,1ak5axb
Any anime you wish to experience it for the first time again?,Discussion,"We watch lots of anime and like some of those very much but we have only a very few anime that we we want to experience it for the very first time again. For example, I have watched nearly five hundred shows over 10 years but there is a very few anime I wish to experience it again, like it is the the first time. For me the shows are...

Clannad (After Story)

Steins;Gate 

Code Geass (for the ending)

Yu Yu Hakusho (the whole journey to the end)

A Silent Voice (both the anime & the manga)

Erased

Death Note (want to fall in love with anime again because it was my gateway anime)

Fmab (for everything)

Parasyte 

Attack On Titan (till season 3. NOT ANYTHING AFTERWARDS)

Tsuki Ga Kirei

Princess Mononoke 

There're many other anime that are in my 10/10 list but didn't mention because the above list is for the shows that I wish to experience for the first time again, not want to cry ugly or be depressed for weeks. For eg. Madoka Magica, Shin Sekai Yori, Evangelion, Violet Evergarden, Grave Of The Fireflies etc etc are the best examples of ""worth watching once, but not twice because you don't have the courage to go through that same phase again"" but only Clannad is the exception here (for me atleast).

Anime being released in chunks,Discussion,"What do you guys think about anime that gets released in large chunks? Like bleach TTYBW and JoJo’s Stone ocean. I personally think that it really kills all the momentum a show has as well as the hype it has. Bleach being separated feels a bit weird but in the end since it gets released weekly when it is airing does a lot to keep it relevant. However stone ocean imo had 0 hype at all because when its parts came out, all the episodes came out at once. That honestly is the killer combo I think, being released in parts but also all at once lets people binge all of it and it loses all hype and relevancy in like a week. Compare stone ocean to Golden Wind and it’s like night and day in that aspect. Every episode of golden wind felt like an event for its viewers to discuss and make memes about what happened that week, but with stone ocean I didn’t feel any of that. Weekly is def the way to go, not at once or in chunks. (Not talking about seasons, just seasons that are cut up in parts)

Thoughts On The Dorohedoro anime....,Discussion,"I was a little surprised and honestly intrigued when the Dorohedoro anime adaption was announced a few years ago. However, I knew I would probably end up being disappointed. It's not because of the CG (although I'm not a CG fan). And it's not that it's terrible, because it isn't. I've just always felt that Q Hayashida's work is so distinct as far as art style, and that it actually loses a lot of charm and identity when it's not in black and white. The art of the manga hooked me immediately, and the unique story and characters kept me invested. It was the same with Dai Dark. It's similar in my mind to how Junji Ito's work never quite seems to work as anime. Does anyone else feel like this? Or is it just me?",False,anime,1707199842.0,1ak31v9

Classroom of the Elite Character Recap (Up to S3 Episode 5),Discussion," Series naturally has a lot of characters and I saw some people were confused so thought I’d drop this to give some refreshers for anyone who forgot who’s who. Not gonna mention anything that hasn’t been in the anime (S3 episode 5) up to this point. There’s a lot of moving plot lines at once so will give a brief summary of what their current or recent situation is along with what we know so far. As a side note almost every character here is usually referred to by their last name so I wouldn’t bother trying to remember their first name to make things easier. Limited to 20 pics so will drop for the ones who are newer or more forgettable

**Class C (formerly Class D)**

Kiyotaka Ayanokoji - Not much to say here (will be referring to him as Kiyo for the rest of this post)

Suzune Horikita - Has slowly been growing as a leader since season 1, has a big inferiority complex over her brother thus is constantly trying to be like him, wants Kushida to put her talents to use for the class but has not had any luck convincing her

Kikyo Kushida - Two faced, destroyed her class in middle school by leaking everybody’s secrets, wants Kiyo and Suzune expelled as a result of knowing this, was willing to work with Ryuuen in S2 and recently was said to be in contact with Nagumo, leaked some class secrets to Kiyo in the recent ep as part of a deal. Kiyo wants to expel her because she’s a nuisance

Kei Karuizawa - Bullied in the past, does some dirty work for Kiyo in exchange to being protected by him and seems to be catching some feelings for him, broke up with Hirata recently

Yosuke Hirata - The cool, popular and reliable guy of the class

Rokusuke Koenji - Complete wild card who does whatever he wants, seems to have very competent abilities but we don’t know to what extent, recently figured out Kiyo defeated Ryuuen just by feeling the grip of his hand

Ken Sudo - Sports jock, has a crush on Suzune, is trying to improve academically to not burden the class

Haruki Yamauchi - Dickhead

Others: Most of the rest are just background characters for now so I wouldn’t worry about them, there is a girl with a red hair clip named Shinohara who Ike defended from the rumors in S3 recently, there’s also an anime nerd with glasses named Sotomura who a lot of people call the ‘Professor’.

 

**Class D (formerly Class C)**

&#x200B;

Arisu Sakyanagi - Arrogant type, leads with mind games and trickery, knows about the “White Room” where Kiyo was raised and is interested in defeating him as she calls him a “false genius” created by his father.

Kohei Katsuragi - Bald guy. In season 1 Class A was split between the Sakayanagi and Katsuragi factions, after he fumbled the exam he lost almost all influence thus Sakayanagi is widely seen as the class leader after that

Why? A character straight out asked in the last episode I watched, and the answer was “he’s special”. Which he definitively is, just not in a good way. Why do these nobles and people of culture fall in love with this guy after a couple of days? It feels like the characters just act however the story needs them to act to get in the direction it needs to go, no matter how unreasonable or weird. Most episodes will have emotional monologues where my face turns into ???, wondering what the hell these people are thinking. It’s like a self-insert power fantasy in inverse.

Anime series you couldn’t follow due to being too long or convoluted,Discussion,"So how do I put it? Well it’s just that lately I’ve been looking back at some shows that I used to follow WAY back in the mid 00s, and to write some examples I want to list Bleach and One Piece.



Like in those times, I had believed that I could take on anything as back then the idea of watching something like One Piece didn’t seem too difficult at first, but as time passed, the show just got so big that I had gotten to the point where I couldn’t keep up with it anymore.




So yeah I just wanted to see if anyone here had any stories that they wanted to share regarding an anime series that they used to follow, until they couldn’t keep up due to reasons like say it got too long or convoluted in some way as I realize now that sometimes it’s ok to drop an anime series if it gets to the point where it’s not for me anymore or something like that.",False,anime,1707185475.0,1ajym97

Is the sign language in A Sign of Affection accurate?,Discussion,"I'm sorry if this has been asked before but if it had I couldn't find it. 

While watching the first episode of  A Sign for Affection, my wife and  I quickly picked up on the use of  sign language in the opening credits, and enjoyed its use throughout the episode. However, my wife  who knows some American Sign Language  was a bit confused by how some of the signs were used, so we don't think it's that. Is this Japanese Sign Language, and if so it's it accurate?

Edit: To those asking, no I did not think they would use ASL in an anime, though I admit I was not aware of JSL until I saw this anime and looked it up. I was asking IF the JSL in this anime was legit or did the creators make up random signs rather than use  JSL. I don't sign it  so I did not know, and sadly the cynic in me would belive that someone would make up signs rather than do the work to make sure what they use is appropriate.

My bf wants me to watch an anime with him and I’ve never seen any anime before. Which should I choose?,What to Watch?,"He said I should pick between hunter hunter, demon slayer, jujutsu kaisen, or attack on titan. 

I don’t really enjoy cartoons or reading subtitles or fantasy but I do want to try to get into it for him😭

Edit - a few things: 
My bf isn’t a huge anime buff like I’m sure most of you are, many of you are saying these are basic which is fine, he just started getting into it and is excited and wants to share it with me! Thank you for the suggestions on anime that are more in line with different interests. 

As for what I usually watch, my favourite genre for shows is sitcoms, but I also like drama and romance. 

Edit 2 - wow thank you all for your answers! I’ll come back to this post over the next while as I deliberate what to watch, so many helpful answers :)

Update I told him about my post and all these answers and he said he would enjoy if I watched one from the list because of how much he loves all of these and wants to see if, when I watch them, I will also enjoy it with him. But he also said he wants to find other shows as well that we could both get into that are more my speed genre-wise. All these responses will really help! I haven’t decided which one from the list I most want to watch but so far from what I’ve read from u guys I’m leaning towards either hunter x hunter or demon slayer. 

Another edit okay I’m still leaning towards demon slayer but haven’t decided fully yet. I’m going to watch one of these first (despite all the comments saying they’re bad starter animes) because I want to try to get into something he loves, which are these animes. Some of the ones I’m planning on looking into, based on what seem to be the most popular recommendations here, are your name, my hero academia, apothecary diaries, spy x family, cowboy bebop, howls moving castle, and violet evergarden. I really am shocked this post got so much attention but thank you all for your responses to me! 

He also doesn’t really want to watch them with dubs but I think I’m going to tell him to deal with it because many of you are saying the dubs are fine for the most part and I think I’ll be a lot more likely to stay engaged that way",False,anime,1707182820.0,1ajxok3

I'm looking for an anime that has a lot of combat. But isn't so much a power creep like DBZ or Naruto is. I'm after something where creativity and wit is what comes out on top. Or even something like Pokemon, where fire beats grass yadda yadda.

what is the real life inspiration behind Blue exorcist's Shima and this spoilers fellow from Noragami?,Help,"**\*\*\* manga spoilers of Noragami \*\*\* I'm personally reading it right now and I'm only at ch49.**

I figure there must a culture reference that inspired these 2 fellas. They give similar vibes. They both act aloof & pretend to be carefree , look like young boys, and use the golden staff with several rings held by a circle.

This is the [fella](https://imgur.com/a/rHmPigk) if you haven't already figured out, right below a picture of Shima. 

Right by each other, I realize they look distinctively different. But Goddamn do they act alike!

First of all, I realize the staff could potentially be a separate reference, I remember seeing it throughout several stories but for now I can only remember Hantengu of anger. ( Demon slayer)

After snooping on Sekido (Hantengu of anger), I realize the staff is named khakkhara & carried by Buddhist monks. Putting all of it here just to make sure this is correct, right?

**Now back to the character design, I'm wondering if their personality & looks are inspired by real life references or a random stereotype Story makers like to use?** 

Like white-haired black people, or Tsunderes, or overly angry bullies, etc...

or perhaps some folklore?

If don't put this, I'd feel bad: 

If I had a nickel for finding aloof-acting, carefree-pretending, cunning dude with a Khakkhara in mangas, I'd have two nickels which isn't a lot but it's weird it happened twice?",False,anime,1707171186.0,1ajt88q

- Not a never-ending story. I don't really want to get into something with heaps and heaps of seasons. 
- Not much filler content.

Non-cringy anime for a group (late 20s),What to Watch?,"My GF and I host movie nights every couple weeks with our friends and we alternate who picks. We recently started including anime. I have a very low tolerance for cringe and tropes, and I'm looking for suggestions for us. We aren't really interested in Shonen or shows that go past the ~25ep mark. 

I personally can't stand the excessive ""fan service"" in a lot of shows, or trope characters such as self insert protagonists, 900 vampire who looks 10, token cute characters, etc... I know that eliminates like 90% of anime, so I've had a hard time finding stuff that sounds interesting.

"It's funny how the most controversial part of the ""I'm in Love with the Villainess"" anime wasn't a thing in the original light novel.",Discussion," I quite enjoyed the first season of ""I'm in Love with the Villainess"" so I decided to start reading through the light novel series that the anime is based on. I'm only up through the second volume right now but the anime covered only the first volume and an eighth of the second, so I've already read through more than everything that was in the anime and so feel comfortable making this post.

A small bit of controversy the anime had was a part of it where people felt the series was comparing homosexuality and incestuous relationships as equivalent, albeit in a positive way.

Quick summary, the main character, Rae Taylor, is an open lesbian in love with Claire François. Someone within their school is orchestrating a series of events with the intention of fanning the flames of class resentment and even goes so far as to unleash a chimera within the school in order to slaughter the aristocrats. Rae confronts the culprit, who turns out to be Lambert, the brother of Claire's maid Lene. Why is he doing all of this? He's being blackmailed by a mysterious man in a mask who will have Lene killed if Lambert doesn't do as he says. Lambert tries to feign like just threatening the life of his sister wouldn't be enough to get him to betray his family and the kingdom, especially when his family directly benefits from supporting the kingdom and having it prosper. Rae then hits him and us with the twist that Lambert and Lene's relationship is not strictly one of brother and sister. The two are involved in an incestuous relationship with each other.

And here's where the main bit of controversy comes in. In the original Japanese, Rae says the line “Homosexual love is not the only one to be taboo.” to further confirm to Lambert, and then soon Lene who has been listening in on the scene, that she knows what they've been doing.

This was less controversial with the English dub, where Rae instead says the line ""They call homosexuality the forbidden love, meanwhile you're in a relationship with your sibling-"", with Rae's VA (who is great, by the way, I love how much of a little friggin' gremlin she makes Rae in a lot of scenes) delivering it in a less than sympathetic manner. But obviously that doesn't change what the original line was.

...Nor does that line in the anime change what the line, or lack there of, was in the original source material, that being the light novel.

Yeah, there is no line like that from Rae at any point in the book where this arc happens or even in the next book when they mention and reflect on the events of the first.

Benefit of the doubt, I think the reason the anime added a line like that, beyond trying to establish a thematic parallel between the protagonist and one of the antagonists, is because the LNs are told from Rae's first person perspective (Konosuba does the same with Kazuma, if I recall correctly). It's Rae's narration that clarifies that Lamert and Lene are in an incestuous relationship, something that isn't nearly as present in the anime, and thus the people making the anime may have felt that leaving things as just what the dialogue in the book was might have been too vague for the audience to understand what the implication was.

Here's that section in the book (page 224 for anyone who wants to see the full context and make sure I'm not taking things *out* of context):

>""My sister is certainly important to me. But do you really think I would endanger the rest of my family for only her?""  
>  
>""If she were only your sister.""  
>  
>This time Lambert's eyes widened. He couldn't have imagined I knew what I'd just implied.  
>  
>""How much do you...""  
>  
>""I told you, everything.""  
>  
>Lambert was in love with Lene - not as a sister, but as a woman. In order to save her, he had no choice but to do as the people holding her hostage directed, even if it meant putting their family's livelihood in danger.

Unlike this scene in the anime, and same for the rest of it, at no point does Rae or the story draw any kind of parallel between familial incest and homosexuality, or even between specifically Lamert and Lene's forbidden love and Rae's love for Claire that she believes will never be reciprocated.

Don't get me wrong, the books don't exactly condemn the relationship either and from what I've read ahead on the two do eventually come back (in very minor support roles), but all the sympathy Rae and Claire show is specifically through the context of how much they care about Lene. This includes the end of the arc when Lambert and Lene are sent into exile (they were originally going to be executed for treason but Rae and Claire managed to get the king to give them a reduced sentence in light of them being blackmailed and their family's long service to the kingdom). In the anime, when Rae is comforting Claire, she talks about how unfair the world can be, how ""We can't even love the one we want to"". And like before, there is no such line in the book. The focus is entirely on Rae comforting Claire, who despite all that had happened didn't want Lene, one of her oldest and closest friends, to leave and how sad it was that things don't always turn out the way people want. They are sympathetic to Lene, they don't judge or condemn her for being in a relationship with her sibling, they give her what they can to have a chance at a happy life wherever she'll end up, but it's all specifically because it's Lene, not because of however they feel about incestuous relationships. In fact in vol. 2 when a noble is craptalking the two traitors and their disgusting relationship, Rae's pissed off defense of them is only in regards to how they were blackmailed into committing treason. She doesn't comment at all on the relationship.

This isn't the worst change I've seen an anime do in an LN adaptation. Rising of the Shield Hero for example will always stand out to me because of how the anime for some bizarre reason decided to make Raphtalia not know what sex was and think that kissing was what made people pregnant. They basically made her weirdly innocent and childish when it came to sex, which made any potential future romance with Naofumi way creepier and with more of a power balance than it was already at risk of being because of the age difference and her initially being his slave, and naturally this was something that caused controversy because yeah, why the fuck wouldn't it?! Meanwhile, LN Raphtalia was well aware of what sex was (the village she grew up in even bred livestock for farming, so she knew how babies were made) and in fact the scenes where the anime had her being clueless and red-faced over the idea of Naofumi kissing her and making her pregnant, in the LN they're about Raphtalia reflecting on the fact that Naofumi is currently incapable of seeing her in any sort of sexual way because of how understandably traumatized he still is over being framed for sexual assault by someone he had trusted and been attracted to. You know, stuff that actually has her have some level of maturity and awareness.

While Lambert and Lene's relationship is nowhere near as relevant to ""I'm in Love with the Villainess"" as Raphtalia and Naofumi's is to ""Rising of the Shield Hero"", like the change to Raphtalia's character it is kind of weird that the anime would give Rae such lines that add a problematic element that wasn't originally there. Yeah, the incestuous relationship between these two side characters was there in the books but there was never any equivalence or parallel made between incest and homosexuality. It was part of the story but it wasn't made part of the story's themes.",False,anime,1707105069.0,1aj78bh

I am a history teacher, but I have the opportunity to teach a middle school anime class (7-9th grade). This is my second year teaching anime and I find the best way to enjoy an anime is to watch a series of pilots before we all vote on their favorites. Here are my stipulations: 

1. Anime must be short(1 Season, 12-24 episodes)
2. Anime must be clean(7th graders exist)
3. Must have a Dub(Too many reading levels for Sub)

"i cant find my childhood anime anywhere, please help",Help,"edit: i found it! thanks guys <3

i used to watch tiji and teletoon all the time as a kid and lots of anime dubbed to french aired on it. there's a magical girl anime on it that took away my breathe but i CANT FIND IT :(

here's what i remember of it (spoiler duh):
main protagonist (pink. idk if her hair is too but she's pink lol) can travel to a different magic world with the help of some pet???? by the time she's back, time on earth has passed by only a second.
in the different world the ¿queen? is ¿dead? so there's a school for the magic wielders  to learn about it, and at the end there's some sort of competition and the winner earns some very powerful thingy and becomes ruler??????

there's a purple genius girl, and a blonde rich bestie, a short snubby dude who's mom is never home (random fact to remember)

the protagonist has a crush on her earth classmate, BUT in the magic world there's an antagonist who looks JUST like him, turns out to be his twin sister and they're BOTH the queen's children. 

final thing i remember, in the competition 2 contestants from 2 different schools were asked to make a dress??? so the blonde rich girl makes one inspired from a droplet on water, made out of water.

it's not madoka magika, little witch academy, precure. it's probs before 2011 but not old enough to look 90's style.

A very specific isekai suggestions request,What to Watch?,"Hi there! This community was really kind and helped me a lot last time I needed some suggestions, so I figured I’d ask for your support again.

The point is I’m really struggling to like the isekai genre and I’ve so far dropped all the isekai anime I’ve tried to give a chance to. It’s obviously not about the lack of quality or good writing, it’s just that I’ve always been naturally adverse to stories set in the past and centred around magic and/or fantasy.

Hence, what I wanted to ask is: are there any good isekai you can suggest that have the protagonist reincarnate in the present or even in the future? Also it would be a huge plus if the characters used some other kind of superpower instead of magic spells and taming mystical creatures (or if they were “normal” people with no powers too!).

Why You Should Watch Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom,Watch This!,"I know, the title sounds like it's straight out of an emo teenager's diary, but don't let that discourage you from giving this amazing anime a shot! If you are interested in a more serious story with a great cast of characters or something a little different than most of the action anime that comes out nowadays and want to watch something a little darker then I highly recommend you give it a try!

&#x200B;

**Synopsis from** [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5682/Phantom__Requiem_for_the_Phantom)

Mafia is rife in America where assassinations are a regular occurrence on the streets. Inferno, a mysterious company, is behind most of these dealings through the use of their near-invincible human weapon, ""Phantom.""

One day, a Japanese tourist accidentally witnesses Phantom's latest murder. Desperate to escape, the tourist hides in a secluded building. However, Phantom, revealed to be a young woman named Ein, and the leader of Inferno ""Scythe Master"" captures the tourist and brainwashes him.

Given the name ""Zwei,"" this once peaceful tourist is now a puppet of Inferno with no memories. Drawn into a world of lies, deceit, and violence, Zwei must fight to survive, hopefully to one day regain his memories and escape from this world where he is constantly on the brink of death.

&#x200B;

**Production Values**

Despite being released in 2009, the animation still holds up surprisingly well. The action sequences are well-animated, and the overall visuals are pleasant to look at. Sure, the art style might seem a bit bland, but the background art is detailed and immersing enough to cover that up. The music is also a great thing about the series, some of the OSTs are also very experimental and unique! Here is the best OST from the series called  ""[Canzone of Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cR-E0oxn4)""

What anime got hated on because of real life?,Discussion,"As the title says, what are the anime that, due to something in real life, got hated on(justified or not) by people?

For example, I remember how much US audiences and reviewers tried to ignore or admitted to hate Police in a Pod because it showed the cops in a normal light while high profile cases of police brutality are/still are happening in the US. Another more specific example is that some audiences don't like how varying the personalities, reasonings and outcome of abusers in MHA are instead of just all of them being straight up monsters that deserved to get arrested or killed like most media tend to portray them due to their own experiences.",False,anime,1707146865.0,1ajj4rf

Characters you don't like but whose hate is overblown/out of proportion,Discussion,"Has there ever been a character you dislike but whose hate you feel like it's out of proportion, especially when it's to the point of wishing physical harm to them just for existing?

This one is no more apparent than Kazuya kinoshita from rent a girlfriend. Say what you will about him since most of the criticism i agree with, like his character constantly regressing which is mostly on reiji letting the shit drag out, but either way Kazuya is good example because half the time it feels like people are only hating on him because it's the popular thing to do before they find a next target and i never see them do it with the other cast members since they're not much better because they, like Kazuya do shitty things including but not limited to sexual assault. cough ruka cough.

As for me, i gave up reading it because of kazuya's family not giving a shit they were lied to for 2 straight years and chizuru, whose just as responsible for letting it go on ran away and only had kazuya do the talking. I gave up afterwards cause it wasn't worth getting mad at.

Also whats with the comparing him to characters like ayanokoji from classroom of the elite? I don't know, it's weird because they're two completely different characters and genres and ayanokoji is a sociopath despite him being one of my favorites. I get the chad characters comparison, but characters like ayanokoji are chad because of the context of their stories and a chad wouldn't fit the kind of story rent a girlfriend is.

One more thing that annoys me the most from the hate is how people always feel the need to keep bringing him up in things unrelated to him or romance in anything anime. Idk because most of it feels forced and are only there for upvotes and karma farming. I never subscribe to the idea of ""if you hate Kazuya, you're just like him"" because it's nonsensical and there's reasons to not like him, like his chizuru obsession, but nobody helps their case by getting that angry at a fictional character.

what takes Hulu so long to get the dubbing for anime?,Discussion,"i pretty much only watch anime in dub (only exception being the weekly releases of attack on titan and mushoku tensei). i used to only watch anime on Hulu, because that was the only streaming service i ever had

i would notice that for some shows, despite knowing it had a dub, would only have sub episodes. which confused me, especially for shows who’s dub had been out for a while. even now, my hero academia season 6 has been out for a long time, and hulu still doesn’t have all the episodes dubbed (i think), but other platforms do

is there a reason for this? i guess this question applies to other streaming services as well. on netflix, devil is a part timer didn’t get its dub for the longest time, despite the dub being out for a while (iirc)",False,anime,1707144499.0,1aji8a0
Anime where the protagonist was the driver of the show.,Discussion,"I just read a post asking for the least interesting protagonists, so I got curious which anime protagonists you felt drove the show. These characters put the ""pro"" in protagonist, not because they're competent, but because they DO feel like the center of the story. Not in the isekai powerfantasy sense, but who they are as people, how they push the plot and or even how they react to the things unfolding. They feel part of the story rather than just there as a guide for the audience. They scream ""now this is how you do a protagonist!"" 

They don't have to be brilliantly written (but that's ofc a plus), so long as you can feel they're the protagonist in a good way. Not in a plot armour sense. 

Some examples I can think of are Natsuki Subaru (Re:Zero), Rudeus Greyrat (Mushoku Tensei), Emiya Shirou (Fate/Stay Night), Mao Mao (Apothecary Diaries), Honda Tohru (Fruits Basket). These are some of the protagonists that I feel are feel engrained within the story and has a presence and leaves an impression. They're not boring cardboard cutouts. Even characters like Bocchi (Bocchi the Rock) can fit. I have more, but I want to hear you guys share too!

Ah, I'd be really cool if you can share why you feel they exemplify a great protagonist even if unorthodox. You can put someone like Makoto from School days if you like!.. Do people think he's a good protagonist? Genuinely curious.

Edit: I realize I put Rudeus Greyrat here subconsciously. Welp, can't help it. Whether you love or hate him, the story definitely does use him as a way to tell the story and he feels like a part of the world. ",False,anime,1707144472.0,1aji7x0
Was Isekai started in Japan?,Discussion,"So, I’m a huge fan of Isekai anime. I know it gets heavily watered down because of the ongoing bandwagon trend to jump on whatever is popular and release hundreds of animes around that style. I’m not really looking to discuss that. 

But, I was thinking about it. I mean the term Isekai is fairly new, but I think the idea of regular people being transported to a fantasy world is obviously not. Specifically I’m thinking back to the old Dungeons and Dragons cartoon of the 80s. Which then sparks the question, was the idea of this actually born in the western world? I’m not as familiar with Manga, particularly old manga and wondering if there’s some that would have the same type of story but predate this cartoon? 

(Side note: I know Alice in Wonderland and the Wizard of OZ maybe be considered these too, but I was more thinking along the lines of a person being transported to a fantasy world where they are then caught up in a hero’s quest with RPG or D&D-style stats.)",False,anime,1707144354.0,1aji6d7

These days every season is so stacked with anime.,Discussion,"I wonder if there were seasoned anime watchers out there like me. There are just so many shows to watch. I thought new season would be better but every season is like previous season.

I have been reading manga/ LN and watching anime for a long time. Every season it's like this:

# 1.Several manga/LN that I once read before got anime adaptations.

For example, in last season there are: Frieren, Dark Gathering. 

In this season: Still Frieren, The witch and the beast, Instant Death, Unwanted Adventurer, The Foolish Angel Dances with the Devil, 'Tis Time for ""Torture"" Princess.

# 2.Several anime with interesting premises.

This season: Sasaki and Peeps

# 3.Several rumored good manga that got anime adaptation .

last season, for example: The Apothecary Diaries.

This season: Dungeon Meshi

# 4.Next season I the anime I have watched.

For example, in last season there are: Spy x Family SS2, Eminence in Shadow ss2, Dr Stone New world part 2, Ragna Crimson part 2, DMDP part 2, JJK ss2. 

In this season: COTE ss3, Tsukimichi ss2, Blue Exorcist ss3, Bottom-Tier Tomozaki ss2

4 types of anime stacking up lead to me following at least 5 different anime of the season.

You know you won't stop because you love watching anime. If you stopped, the anime would stack up to next season and you would want to watch it anyway cuz you still kinda enjoy it. I could drop 3-4 shows, but in the end there are still many enjoyable ones.

Where did all these number from the video on Youtube come from?,Misc.," So according to this video on Youtube, ""soLo leVeLiNg BROkE The InteRneT"", but I have seen so little talk about it. The talk about it is almost non-existent in random subreddits. Random clips on Youtube are not even high views like anime below it like Frieren and JJK2. Nothing notable about meme section either. In fact, these past few months, the Lobotomy Kaisen just spreads everywhere like wildfire because fans went crazy and Frieren has Elf Feet + Cloth Melting Potion memes.

I saw Solo Leveling karma on this sub does not come even close to ""breaking internet"" and on MAL it's like 73k scorers with 400k members, while anime below Solo leveling like Frieren has 160k scorers with 500k members and JJK 2 with 370k scorers+ 820k members

Just where did this number come from?

"If it wasn’t Blue Exorcist, what was it?",Help,"Blue exorcist?

Years ago I watched an anime on Netflix and really enjoyed it. It was about a high school aged boy who worked as an exorcist and had blue flames from his hands and sword. I could’ve sworn I watched and enjoyed Blue Exorcist. 

With the new season coming out, I went to rewatch it and it’s a whole different story. Completely. 

The one from years ago started with a girl traveling to school on a train and she sees a fight in the forest with a boy who takes on several bad guys or thugs in a fury of blue flame. She is in awe and then finds that same boy goes to her school, and wears gloves all the time. He is also absent a lot because of whatever work he does. She finds out his truth and tries to help him keep his secret identity.  There are other characters that are familiar to what’s on now like his brother and someone like Angel but they don’t go to school with him he only meets up with them when he goes to help in exorcist situations.

Campfire cooking in another world with my absurd skill for a non anime viewer,Discussion,"Hello!

For a bit of context, the only anime I've been able to consistently watch was Inuyasha, the rest I dropped because I wasn't enjoying them. If anything I'm more of a manga reader although recently I've only kept up with Dungeon Meshi and finished Umineko no naku koro ni.

I decided to give Campfire cooking a go as I like fantasy monsters and I like cooking. Let me preface this by saying I really enjoyed the different creatures and the dishes made with them looked delicious, and the show was overall enjoyable. However I don't understand...the point? 

Please don't come at me before I explain. I suppose there is animes where everything goes well and you ad a viewer are just witnessing a happy calm life but it felt weirdly empty in the sense of the main character doesn't experience any conflict during the whole show. He has a familiar that is able to destroy everything real quick, he has a barrier that shields him from everything, and he makes a crazy amount of money. When they present you with a new creature Fel just destroys it. To me the story didn't feel compelling at all (as there was no story), like, does he not want to go back to his world? How is he not surprised to be summoned? Plus no characters actually stick long enough to care.

I still did like to a degree the cooking but that was about it and I'd like to understand why this anime has such high praise (not coming for anyone that likes it, it's just that obviously not being much in this world I'm not too sure of what's expected of the genre)

And also: is there any other anime with a similar theme that has a more compelling story ir at least that has the MC overcome some hurdles? Don't recommend Dungeon Meshi as I'm up to date with the manga please 🙏

The first thing was that the main girl was at a party with a man who I believe she liked and there was a bowl of punch and another bowl with spiked punch 
She drank the spiked one and passed out, the man brought her inside and as she rested then she woke up and continued conversing with him 
The only other scene we know of was a scene with her and a handful of friends under a lamppost

I’m pretty sure it was on Netflix as that was my only means of watching anime at that time

What animes in your opinion are overrated and why?,Discussion,"Devilman Crybaby - Used shock value to draw people in and then was devoid of emotion during what should've been emotional scenes imo

Bocchi the Rock - Portrays anxiety as some crippling disease where you are not able to function at all. Anxiety in reality is a before and after thought primarily, however it can also be a strong “during” thought (class presentation comes to mind). Going to a meet up becomes 100x more stressful because you are contemplating completely irrelevant things from 100 different angles because anxiety. So many people were saying ""literally me."" I have powerful anxiety and I know it is variable depending on the person, but the Bocchi portrayal is not even semi realistic, even in the worst cases.

Frieren - I am a week to week watcher and think its fantastic, but the writing up to this point does not put it at an S tier level. It's rated higher than FMA:BH on MAL when the writing by ep 20 in FMA is worlds better and introduces much more creativity/world building/depth/plot. So far frieren is ""old elf that looks young has a strong love for magic, enjoys traveling with her party, and is trying to gain more spells. Also enjoys her companions company.""

&#x200B;

JJK - Plot development < Fight with good animation. Don't really need to elaborate on this. Over half of S2 was dedicated to flashy fights with hardly any dialogue. A mix of both is necessity.

I’m trying to find one of the first anime’s I watched on Netflix,Help,I don’t remember much but it was about this three kids that were in a orphanage or something like that. The girl of the group got taken and then only two boys were left. Then one of the kids punches a wall or something to save himself and the other kid and someone watches them. Then the main character is taken to be a knight or some shit and finds his old childhood friend(the girl) but she’s like a god or something. He becomes a knight to protect her and shit but then they find out that their other childhood friend is evil. I think he was being controlled and they try to save him. That’s about as much as I remember. I think there was a lot of things about like gods and I remember that the main character had a connection to a Pegasus or something. Also the main character that went evil had a scene with the other male character in which they were on top of a hill and they drew something. I think it also had to do with this bracelets that the girl main character made for them. I think the main character that was a knight had a crush on the girl and the other male main character or at least it seemed like it.

Cowboy Bebop - Anime of the Week,Weekly,"Welcome to the weekly Anime of the Week Discussion Thread! Each week, we're here to discuss various older anime series. Today we are discussing...

## Cowboy Bebop

Crime is timeless. By the year 2071, humanity has expanded across the galaxy, filling the surface of other planets with settlements like those on Earth. These new societies are plagued by murder, drug use, and theft, and intergalactic outlaws are hunted by a growing number of tough bounty hunters.

Spike Spiegel and Jet Black pursue criminals throughout space to make a humble living. Beneath his goofy and aloof demeanor, Spike is haunted by the weight of his violent past. Meanwhile, Jet manages his own troubled memories while taking care of Spike and the Bebop, their ship. The duo is joined by the beautiful con artist Faye Valentine, odd child Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV, and Ein, a bioengineered Welsh Corgi.

While developing bonds and working to catch a colorful cast of criminals, the Bebop crew's lives are disrupted by a menace from Spike's past. As a rival's maniacal plot continues to unravel, Spike must choose between life with his newfound family or revenge for his old wounds.

The exactl next thing I remember is the villain and his army, and I remember this scene perfectly, the villain now stornger than ever, gets mad at a random soldier of his, levitates his soldier and starts breaking his spine.

***Gunpla is Freedom!***

**Questions of the Day:**

1) Now that we've seen all that the Gundam Build shows have to offer (other than Metaverse, which you can watch on your own), which *one* character is your favorite? How about your least-favorite?

2) Which entry is responsible for giving you the most of your favorite songs from all of these shows?

3) How do you rank each of the shows that we watched for this rewatch? If you've seen other Gundam shows, where do these rank amongst your favorites?

4) If you were in charge of making your own Gundam Build series, what would you have it be about, and what sort of Gunpla would you have the characters use?

5) What do you do at the end of the rewatch? Are you busy? Will you save me?

Why is Frieren so good and enjoyable ?,Discussion,"Frieren has been one of my favourite anime to come out in the 2020s but I just don't know why ? Besides the animation, music and some characters everything else feels average and even generic, especially the fantasy world, but it's still so good, I sit there after the episode trying to understand why did I enjoy it, I don't know how to explain it, they made a whole episode about Fern being ill and it was still so good, I don't know how or why but I can't complain.",False,anime,1707087461.0,1aj177o
Suggest me an anime about high school similar to Classroom of the elite.,What to Watch?,It could be high school or college what's important is that it's about school not just has a school setting. Taking exams and studying should be vital to the plot. So more like COTE as opposed to Mha or High School dxd,False,anime,1707087181.0,1aj13fo

How important are Opening and Ending songs for your impression of an anime?,Discussion,"As stated above, how do the songs chosen for particular anime, or an episode cour have an effect on your enjoyment, memory, or overall perception of it?

For me, I have noticed that if there is a good song attached to it, my attention is grabbed more easily, since I look forward to it and puts me in a good mood (especially important for me to follow weekly releases). Some personal and recent examples for this are Undead Unluck S1 op, Apothecary Diaries S1 op, Frieren S1 and S2 op and ed, and Jujutsu Kaisen Hidden Inventory Arc op.

On the other side, there are openings, like the Domestic Kanojo one, that I love, but can't seem to be enough to persuade me into liking the anime as a whole.
Others are songs like Blue Aoi, or the Durarara S1 opening, that instantly make me travel in time back to when I first watched them.

Edit: Thanks for all the replies! From what I've recollected the consensus is, for the most part, that it really does matter as an adjacent of the show, but not really being too influential in the enjoyment of it, however it can become an emotional hook for watchers after a long time. Sorry for the late replies! This has been some great insight and I'm excited to listen to the op/eds you've recommended!
Do you have any favorites? Any songs that you listen to years after having watched an anime that suddenly bring you back in time to when you first listened to it? Any anime you decided to watch just because of the op and ed? I would love to read your experiences.",False,anime,1707085867.0,1aj0l21
Heya im looking for a specific anime that i saw in an insta reel and sadly i couldnt find the reel anymore,Help,"so in the clip the MC i assume? is confronted by a group of priests or guards im not sure who say he will be judged or something and then the main priest/guard  uses a gravity spell and forces the MC and his group to the ground.   then you can see the MC slowly standing up and the evil dude says something like ""not even a swordmaster like you can escape this gravity field""

&#x200B;

then the MC says ""im not a swordsmaster, i just wield the sword cause it looks cool""  and then he uses ""magic reversal"" and the gravity field switches to the evil dudes side and pulls all of them down

Animes similar to A Sign of Affection • Yubisaki to Renren,What to Watch?,"does anyone know any animes similar to a sign of affection? there's only 5 eps out right not and it kinda sucks waiting bc i'm really enjoying it and i wish i could just binge it.

i'm trying to find an anime with these sort of similarities to it:

\- set in college

\- really nice animation style

\- mature characters who make the plot happen, the plot does not happen to them

\- things move fast ish b/c no petty drama / lies / childish stuff like that

\- easy & cute watch but still a little serious

\- honesty between the mc's

\- ok this one is something i just liked about the anime but they had a little costco scene/reference and it was so cute and i've never really seen anything like that in other animes

thank you in advance!",False,anime,1707081473.0,1aiyuip
Is there an anime for me?,What to Watch?,"I grew up watching Naruto, Dragon ball, Bleach and also watched some others along the way such as Katekyo Hitman Reborn, Fairy tail, One Piece. However some time has passed and I wanted to comeback and watch I haven't yet explored. I very much enjoyed Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I also tried Hunter x Hunter, Attack on Titan, Black Clover and Demon Slayer which were recommended to me. The issue that I have, and I may not have this problem when I was younger, how stupid the characters are. They are almost  caricature. Main character that's an oaf, likes to eat, has no boundaries, is a loveable idiot, and wants to get stronger amongst many traits. I feel like most of the stuff is just recycled characters with different setting.    


Another thing - I get that anime is Japanese but some things are just to annyoing. Like the Zenitsu character from Demon Slayer. Or that characters seem to be ok with death, killing. There is always a 180IQ genius 12 year old that's been training martial arts he's been 3, because his parents abandoned him. It is a school / university but still ""kids"" are either taking things to seriously, are too violent... it just doesn't feel right for me. There's always a 'baka' girl, people beating up eachother for no reason. Hero has no life - only a goal to get stronger. This is abuse, not a training. You don't get good by practicing for 16h a day, running 10km and doing 100 push-ups. You make a mistake? Your mentor takes away your food etc.  


Another thing - that's a shonen thing nowadays but annoys me so much... Why does everyone have to have a special power? Like in first 2 Jojo chapters it was kind of cool but since the 3rd one each episode was basically scooby-doo'ing enemy stando. That's like the whole premise of Hunter x Hunter, Jojo, One Piece, later Naruto, later Bleach and the list goes on.   


So overall Attack on Titan was cool, although a bit too dark for me. Fullmetal alchemist was splendid. First two seasons of Jojo - great! I remember fondly Naruto but that might be nostalgia speaking. I think that I might be into Shonen but cannot tell.   


tldr; how do I find something that I may like?

Animes to watch outside of popular things?,What to Watch?,"I watched many of popular things like Mukoshu tensei, TenSura and so on, and have taste for power fantasy titles with OP MCs with little to no shortcomings. 

I have strong aversion for situations where writer wants to show ""weak humane characters"", ""fragile identities"", ""rough life"" and ""deep thoughts"". I'd rather look at ""bad, cliched and fan service"" title than ""award winning masterpiece""

The reason is i use anime to escape real life, not experience it. And ""deep thoughts"" is usually is not made properly, thus I often have quite rational and logical reasons to disagree with author, and I will never watch anything I strongly disagree with.  As I do ""smart things"" for life i don't even want to bother to figure out if I am agree or not with ""deep thoughts"" (because i was doing that for 8 hours straight 30 mins ago). 

So i'm asking for list of  ""bad"" small titles without much sense or pretentiousness to watch while being not fully in  consciousness . ",False,anime,1707079281.0,1aixxtw

The same goes for everybody else who gets reincarnated in the same world. I have no further information about this anime and know that there are a ton of reincarnated animes out there.

"Isekai anime but different, I can’t remember the anime?",Help,"So this anime has to deal with a man getting transported into another world, and in the New World, there are so many people who have been transported there that the have created their own Japanese community. 
I only saw one episode and all I can remember is that this anime is different in that the transported person isn’t part of a single group and isn’t the only one of their own. This anime is different in that a bunch of people have been transported to the New World and it’s not anything Unique

Usually isekais have a person who is unique with crazy mad skills and are respected as saviors of the New World. Usually transports are the only ones from Japan in the new world. 

The anime I’m trying to find has a bunch of Japanese ppl getting transported through out time to this new world and the new world isn’t surprised and even created their own Japanese presence in the new world

I know it’s an anime released after 2020

What does edgy actually mean?,Discussion,"This is a word I see thrown around a lot in the anime community, usually to describe characters but sometimes an entire anime, and I don’t really get what it means. Based on how people use the word, I assume its like a shallow type of darkness or something that a teenager would think is dark, but based on the characters people describe as edgy, it doesn’t seem to always be negative. Some characters people label as edgy are Guts, Thorfinn, Kaneki, Sasuke, Eren, and I definitely don’t think all these characters are dark in a shallow way.

So what does edgy mean? Can characters who are edgy still be good or well written?",False,anime,1707073662.0,1aivms0

**QUESTIONS FOR POST SERIES DISCUSSION** ***FROM YOU FOR YOU!:***

That’s right, you read it correctly! Since one big part of Gintama is about meaningful relationships between Gintoki and his friends, and caring the burden together, I decided to let everyone add a one question that we will answer next week.

So take your time with your answers that you will post next week during the Post Series Discussion on **11th of February.**

# Now to the Questions for post series discussion:

Q1 - What was your favourite aspect of Gintama? Characters? Comedy? All of it?

Q2 - What do you do at the end of the rewatch? Are you busy? Will you save me?

Q3 - Since it took 10 years between the last successful Gintama Rewatch and this one, what is something you'd like to say to either the host or the watchers of the next one in 2034?

Q4A - **FOR FIRST TIMERS** - When did you realize that this show had an over-arching plot developing alongside all the jokes and which episode was ""The one"" that made you go, ""that's it, I'll watch it 'till the end""?

Q4B - **FOR REWATCHERS** - How did it feel watching the series with all the previous knowledge of the plot and watch the characters interactions develop?

Q5 - Without taking in consideration the existence of overarching story of Gintama that existence was a secret revealed in later arcs, how would you expect the Gintama to end if Gintama was only 100% toilet humor/slapstick/gag humour and other aspects of low comedy?

Q6A - How would you murder your rewatch host?

Q6B - What's your favourite shitpost from the show or rewatch?

Q7 - Are there any other rewatches you will be joining?

Q8 - What character did you change your opinion on the most over the course of the series and how?

Q9 - Did any of the many anime references in Gintama made you more interested in watching the referenced show?

Q10 - Gintama has a unique form of storytelling, where there is alot of episodic, unconnected episodes, with the serious arcs sprinkled in between. its not until later where we get more serious arc instead of episodic, comedy and meta episodes. So overall did this format work for you? Did the comedy always land? and was it ever a chore to get through?

Q11 - Did you have a favorite running gag? If so, what was it?

# BUT HERE IS A TWIST!!!

Since you spent a whole year talking to each other, could you actually guess the participant that asked the particular question judging by the question? If you dare, then include your answers in the table below in your comment for the next week!

"What Have You Watched This Past Week That is NOT a Currently Airing Show? [February 4th, 2023]",Weekly,"Title says it all - talk about the anime you watched this past week that are not a part of this Winter 2024 season (like **Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun 2nd Stage** or **Dungeon Meshi**), or a show that's continuing from previous seasons (like **Sousou no Frieren**).

With regards to Fall 2023 shows, however, it would be fine to write about them as long as you only began them after they finished airing. For example, it's fine to talk about watching **The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You** or **Arknights: Perish in Frost** if you started them after the final episode aired. Obviously, use your best judgement on this.

**Please use spoiler tags**; it's super simple stuff. An example below:

        [KonoSuba Ep 9] >!""THIS WAS A VERY BAD EPISODE, DARKNESS DID NOT DESERVE THAT!<

comes out to be [KonoSuba Ep 9] >!""THIS WAS A VERY BAD EPISODE, DARKNESS DID NOT DESERVE THAT!<

Kemono no Souja Erin really hit me,Discussion,"I watched the 50 episode long series recently after putting it off for many years due to a bias against the older style visuals I saw in episode 1. I have to say I kind of don't regret it because watching it at my current late 20s age really let me get a lot out of it.

The transition of the MC from childhood through major life stages and the constant shift in the groups of people she is around felt very real to me. It reminded me a lot of how people drift around in my actual life and how I shouldnt take it for granted that certain people will just be around.

The world building and politics were shockingly rich as well, it din't feel like those constant cookie cutter settings you see in a lot of isekai fantasy these days. Ryoza legitimately feels like a unique setting with its own customs, culture, animals and vegetation.

The old time aesthetics actually gave me a strong nostalgic vibe as well, it's not overly shiny and bright like modern anime and the characters look a little less attractive. But the world feels so much more real and the fantasy creatures that the MC takes care of as a fantasy world veterinarian come across as especially majestic and otherworldly.

I did have some problems with the pacing and how abruptly the ending was pushed on the audience after dragging the last arc for 5 episodes longer than it should have been, but overall I got to say this was one amazing watch.",False,anime,1707067528.0,1ait5or
Watching Kimi no Todoke today feels like watching a parody,Discussion,"Not because it’s bad or anything! I’ve just seen classic shoujos spoofed so many times in anime from monthly girls nozaki kun, welcome to demon school iruma kun, kaguya-sama, undead unluck, the list goes on. The English dub just came out for the series, and watching it I can tell that Kimi no Todoke is clearly the epitomized example of what they’re parodying, so it’s hard to take the ba-dumps, the dazzling stills of Kazehaya smiling, the manufactured drama, the rival who looks sweet but is evil, the too-pure-for-this-world MC, without feeling like it's all part of some larger punchline. This is coming from a huge shoujo fan, and i can feel the infuences of Kimi no Todoke in some of my faves in the genre such as fruits basket, but no other shoujo feels so much like a parody of the genre as this one does 😅

Where did the Pink-Blue-Yellow magical girl color scheme come from?,Discussion,"This has been eating away at me for about a year now, but with a new season of Precure upon us and a less family-friendly magical girl show that's making the rounds this season (one could say people are *gushing* over it), I figured I should ask.

If you've never seen a magical girl show before, you've still probably seen these colors. The classic magical girl triplet of the pink lead with her blue and yellow companions shows up anywhere if you want to make a magical girl reference (unless you're *Weathering With You* and want to make a real deep cut). It's synonymous with the genre at this point, but my only remaining question is where did it come from? 

I know pink leads are about as old as color in this genre, and the tried and tested use of the three primary colors for products aimed at kids is probably just as long (see why the original Gundam is colored the way it is), but when this iconic color scheme became the goto for magical girl triads is a little harder to pinpoint. The two biggest works from the 90s era (*Sailor Moon* and *Cardcaptor Sakura*) didn't use it (the latter also only focusing on a singular magical girl) and other similar magical girl( or magical girl-esque) shows from the time like *Magic Knight Rayearth* and *Tokyo Mew Mew* also narrowly avoid the scheme. My next guess would be Precure given that franchise's ubiquity, but Precure arguably didn't adopt the full scheme until 2010 with *Heartcatch Precure* (2009's *Fresh Precure* sort of adopts it, but with a blonde pink lead instead of the ""traditional"" pink hair). However, not even a year after *Heartcatch*, *Madoka Magica* would use the scheme as its pseudo-default magical girl palette, and I doubt 2010 was just teeming with so many *Heartcatch Precure* clones that the scheme became the default. The closest lead I can find is 1999's *Magical Doremi* which featured Pink, Blue, and (Yellow-ish) Orange, but information online about this topic is scarce (or hard to search for) so its hard to lock this one in as the definitive answer.

Admittedly, I'm still rather new to the world of magical girls, so I'm hoping someone with a little more experience with the genre could enlighten me on the matter, or (if there wasn't just one series to attribute it to) how this scheme eventually came to be so dominant...

[I mention Heartcatch Precure, but even that one had a fourth purple Cure added later in the run so...](https://preview.redd.it/iac1ektkjlgc1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff4d1c122ba0e26a26fc337ad17c89fe1fbc43ae)",False,anime,1707064681.0,1ais0iu

I need to finish Gintama now. I'm halfway through and it has some really strong moments as well. 

Are there any other comedy anime that have similar ""serious"" undertones out there for one to watch? I would love some suggestions. Ty in advance.",False,anime,1707064657.0,1ais064

"You should watch/read ""Undead Unluck""",Discussion," So I started reading Undead Unluck a few days ago cause I was too impatient for the anime, and at around 100 chapters now I have to say, it has been an amazing decision. Undead Unluck has one of the most interesting plots involving characters with superpowers.

The art is amazing, the characters are fun, the fights are great and the story is exciting, The world-building is detailed and one-of-a-kind. The whole manga reminds me of why I like unique power systems and characters who use those powers in creative ways. The story never loses its pacing and always has a way of engaging you, that is also one of the reasons why JoJo's is one of my favorite manga of all time. The parts of the story that concern the whole world also remind me of the world-ending events in Jojo's, so if you love JoJos, Chainsaw Man or JuJutsu Kaisen, you will also love Undead Unluck

So I'm kinda disappointed that the anime isn't able to gain as much traction as other big shows because this show does deserve to be bigger. So if you haven't watched/read Undead Unluck, you should give it a try, It's a great action-adventure-comedy story, It's story about the quest to find the greatest death possible.",False,anime,1707054942.0,1aiof17

Anime & characters with mental health symptoms?,Discussion,"Hello Everyone! 
I'm doing a research project on mental health portrayed in anime. 

While I know in Japanese Culture (along with most minority cultures) talking about mental health is little to nonexistent. 

I am hoping that this research project will help reach a new set of audience. 

If you know any animes that have a theme of a mental health condition or character that shows traits of a mental health condition, I would love to see what comes up.

I have been watching anime for a decade now 

Here is my top 10

**1. Monogatari series** – geniusly written story, amazing animation every frame is like a wallpaper, this anime is piece of art, it's an experience.

**2. Madoka magica** – same studio as the previous one so the animation is geart, really amazing story, it's very unique take. 

**3. Kuzu no Honkai** – the best and realist romance anime in existence. It's targeted for adults so Most kids doesn't understand this anime and blindly hate it.

**4. Mushoku tensei** – peak isekai, character development and world building is top quality. Animation is great. 

**5. O maidans in your savage** – really good coming of age story. Good animation.

**6. Eminence in shadow** — This anime is so cringe that transcends the highest level of cringe and becomes the coolest anime you have ever seen, watching this I have had Most fun in a long time. 

**7. Cautious hero** — This anime has really top notch voice acting, great animation and overall great comedy 

**8. Higurashi when they cry** — if you like horror this anime is for you, it's a classic

March comes in like a lion was great but…,Discussion,"Shogi still seems kind of boring. Whenever they were playing shogi with a few exceptions i was generally kind of bored.

Of course if i knew how to play shogi maybe that would change a bit. I know its supposed to show Rei growing and changing as a person but i like the show more when it focused on the sisters and the side characters interacting with him. As well as the sisters story in season 2.

I know ppl love this show so my rating at least for the first season will probably receive some backlash. I go by mal scores so a 7/10 is good, a 9/10 is great.

Season 1: 7/10 
Season 2: 9/10

I almost dropped the show towards the middle/end of the show around episode 16 for season 1 but hearing how great season 2 was made me push through it a bit more. Im glad i did because season 2 was great but i think if i hadnt already been well acquainted with slower anime i probably wouldve dropped it. 

The first half of season 1 was pretty good but the middle got boring, idr much of the end of season 1. Im trying to keep this spoiler free for the most part so my answers are kind of vague. I put season 1 on hold for a couple months around episode 16 tho so my memory of season 1 is kind of vague. Started season 1 like 6 months ago, started season 2 like a month ago.

Tldr: The sisters were great I dont think there was a part of the show I disliked when they were there, His past and his stepsister were interesting, The teacher and the fat kid shogi player were cool, the shogi was done pretty well but my attention span is trash so it was mostly boring to me.

 Overall i recommend it, not as a first anime but if u have watched a decent amount like 20-30 that aren’t just action animes u would probably enjoy it. Hope they make a season 3 eventually.",False,anime,1707051890.0,1aingb0

Violet Evergarden is a masterpiece,Discussion,"I just finished watching the 13 episodes of the main anime and am blown away by how beautiful and emotional this anime was. I am ashamed that I originally wrote this anime off when it initially aired after only watching one episode. Finally years later I decided to give it another chance because I've seen it mentioned positively several times on this sub.

The story telling, setting, animation, characters, and music are all so beautiful. This anime starts off slow but by the second half, each episode is full of emotions and makes you really feel sad for Violet and the people she encounters. I haven't cared about a protagonist this much in a long long time. I love how Violet was written from being an emotionless killing machine to a very sweet and emotional woman who wants to find the most important person in her life and find closure.

I highly recommend this anime for anyone who wants a change of pace and to experience an truly beautiful story. I plan on watching the 2 movies next after this and if anyone knows of similar animes, please recommend them.

Cyberpunk Edgerunner : 4 Stars, was the one which got me into anime.

Death Note: 4.5 stars

Monster: 4.5 stars

One Piece (Have taken a break during Dressrosa, to much filler) : 4 stars

Jujutsu Kaisen: 4 stars (struggled with season 1, loved season 2)

Attack on Titan; 5 stars, some of the best writing I’ve seen, not only in anime. And think the ending was perfect.

Neo Genesis: 3.5 stars

Chainsaw man: 4 stars

Demon Slayer: 3 stars, only finished first season/arc and not really interested in continuing anytime soon.

Like I recall like it was yesterday that when the show had then recently ended, I read criticism online from some viewers stating that the villain herself was not properly developed in general, so yeah I was just wondering what exactly went wrong with the story itself, but maybe this is the wrong forum to ask about such a series again due to it being a bit old.",False,anime,1707031450.0,1aii91n

What are your thoughts on the production committee system? Are there any other successful alternatives to producing an anime?,Discussion,"A main advantage of the production committee system is that it enables various companies to minimize the risk of producing and financing an anime. 

A main disadvantage is that even if the anime does well, the profits are to be split; not evenly depending on who financed more into the production. 

___

But these are points as it relates to the sponsors. What about as it relates to the contractors and subcontractors - i.e the animation studios?

For example, in this [Animator Dormitory video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=O2yLGjCz_JM), Ryoko stresses the root of the anime industry wage crisis is due to the production committee system. She claims the system “structurally keeps production costs low” and references to this [video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZUwlwQj40VI&t=0s) as to why. 

A few points made in this other video are:

* production committees do not give enough budget to the animation studios.

* production committees do not “allow animators to benefit from the royalties” after the studio(s) contract are done. I think this especially applies to committees where the animation studio is not on the committee.

* to the above point, royalties would really only be given to “Directors, scenario writers, and similar roles” and not to the majority of the animators.

* If one company wants to raise the animation budget for the animation studio, all other companies would have to be on board.

They claim optimizing workflows with digital technologies or AI would help both animation studios and the committee; at the same time, I just feel like that makes production committees try to expect the anime to be made faster and cheaper and to justify a lower budget in the future. 

Especially when you look at Kadokawa’s quarterly reports and how they want to increase the number of anime they produce every year, I can’t help but think animation studios will suffer more.

At the same time, just how much can production companies finance? Would they be able to turn a profit if they increased the anime budget by 3x  to account for animator pay - as in the $ / cut animators earn is 3x more? 

We envision these companies to be greedy, but can they actually give a manageable budget in the first place? Even with the production committee system which is designed to minimize risk, it seems profits still do not turn out all that well all the time.

Like is the production committee system even good? Or can it be better? If it can be better, has there been successful alternatives?",False,anime,1707026255.0,1aigvy0

The scene was almost completely black with a scary cat-like or demon face. I think it was a fight and I think the characters were mostly all red or maybe even just outlines. It was sort of trippy and used a lot of perspective shots where the characters face was closer to the camera. 

For some reason puppetry or strings come to mind as well. I mostly only watch dark/horror anime so it was probably something thing of that genre but I’m not sure.

"Girls of r/anime, what are some actually well-written female characters?",Discussion,"*Everyone’s allowed to chime in with their opinions, but I mainly care about what the girlies think. 

Recently I’ve been thinking a lot about how I struggle to name more than a handful of well-written female characters in anime. So I tried to look up articles and other subreddits but it was obvious that most of these opinions belonged to men. Of course I’m not saying men can’t have an opinion on this, but I’m more interested in hearing other women’s opinion. If I’m being honest, it’s not only disappointing but also somewhat alarming to see the female characters that some (but often many) men deem well written, as they’re usually not. 

Personally, I think that Jolyne from JoJo’s part 6 is one of the best female characters in anime, but I also really like Maka (Soul Eater), Morgiana (Magi), Asa (Chainsaw Man) and all the Studio Ghibli girls of course. I’m also currently watching Nana and I absolutely love the female characters. 

I would love to hear everyone’s opinion and hopefully get some inspiration on new anime as I’m dying too see some good female representation.

*EDIT: I should have specified that I don’t usually watch romance/ slice of life anime. I’m aware that there are many great female characters in these anime genres that cater specifically to women. I guess my issues is that in most anime that don’t solely cater to women, well written female characters are far and few between (e.g. main stream anime, seinen, action/ adventure, psychological, thriller etc) 

**EDIT: I’m very sorry if I ever came off as rude when replying to anyone. I’m really happy that so many people have engaged with my post and I love to hear people’s different opinions and perspectives. Everything I say is subjective and only my own opinion, it is not objective and it is no more correct than anyone else’s opinion. Please feel free to disagree with me or roast my opinions.

Bocchi the review...by me.,Writing,"I've always been into music anime since watching love live. Hearing the sounds and lyrics from a different part of the world is always fun. Not to mention seeing really cool people come together and make magic happen. That's what I saw while watching bocchi the rock. An anime that took the community by storm and is still popular to this day. It has style, comedy, interesting characters and most of all cool music. The story starts with the titular character bocchi gotoh trying to make friends. But unfortunately for her, finding popularity as an introvert is pretty hard. 

She can't talk to anyone without freaking out. And would literally turn to ash before being that extroverted party animal. But thankfully for her; she picks up a guitar as a way to express herself. After years and years of practice (due to her having nothing else to do) she becomes a virtuoso. So much so that she starts her own YouTube channel and racks up a hefty subscriber count. But unfortunately, loneliness still pulls at her no matter what she does to cope. So one day in an attempt to make some friends, she brings her guitar to school. Hoping that someone will find it interesting and talk to her. 

Sadly she doesn't get any bites, until she meets a blonde girl named nijika ijichi. Who begs her to join her group after a fallout with another guitar player. Bocchi tags along, fighting off a mental meltdown along the way. It's then that she's introduced to the world of Rock n roll through various clubs and eccentric people. Not just that, but we get to see her start what comes to be known as kesoku band. The world of bocchi is what really brought this show to life for me. As everyone is so colorful and filled with a unique swagger that makes them stand out.

Take nijikas older sister Seika for an example. She's the cool and collected owner of a club called starry. A hole in the wall locale where underground bands play for their audiences. It's here she puts bocchi and her friends to work. Letting them earn money to rent out venues while at the same time learning by watching different bands. You gotta love a tsundere type character who is hard on the outside. But on the inside she just wants this young group of rockers to be ready. Between that and her always taking care of her little sister, it's no wonder why she's a personal fave. 

One that I don't care for is Ryo, the blue haired bassist of kesoku band. She comes off as a quiet and more reserved type, but that's just a cover up. She's really a bumming leech that wants to take advantage of all her friends. I mean seriously, she tries to take from poor bocchi every chance she gets. Whether it's making her buy food for advice or suggesting different restaurants knowing she has no money. I mean she's just terrible, she refuses to pay anyone back. And I just can't believe the group puts up with such a horrible person. I'm sorry to people who like her, I just think she's freaking sorry!

Speaking of horrible people, now ill talk about my absolute favorite character. Hiroi kikuri, the bassist and singer of a more experienced group sick hack. A band that is absolutely huge in the underground scene. But sadly the group can't find much success due to their singer being a full fledged alcoholic. Hiroi to me is absolutely adorable, and helped bocchi beat some of her fears. She also helped her sell tickets to kesoku band's first performance. But the people around her definitely wouldn't agree with me. As she bums folks for money to get wasted, passes out in different locations. And even damages the venues where she plays; causing her to be pretty broke. Not to mention the fact that she has some serious issues going on in her head. 

One's that she'd rather drown with alcohol than face on her own. And if you read her spin off manga by the same author, you'll learn a lot more about her. And I hate to say it, but I've been absolutely loving kikuris manga. Maybe even more than bocchi and the gang's story. I guess I'm one of those types that believes I could fix her problems. 

The animation in this show was absolutely fantastic. Not being too serious and having some hilarious moments. But at the same time being one of the most visually stunning shows out now. You could tell the studio made this with plenty of love. It's really needless to say that the music was awesome. From the opening and ending credits to the music in the show. This one really took the cake when it came to catchy tunes. I definitely recommend looking up sick hacks song watashi dake yuurei, as it is totally fire. In fact I wish they would release an entire album instead of just one song.

The show has thirteen episodes and I hear it's getting a movie. While there's no dub, the voice actors really do a good job bringing everyone to life. The issues it tackles pertaining to loneliness and making friends really hit home with me. I can relate to bocchis struggles to try and fit in; it's not easy out there. As I am a person who doesn't get out much but would probably benefit from a group like kesoku band. So if you want an anime that has cute girls doing awesome things. And a show that can teach you a thing or two about making friends. Then check out bocchi the rock, an award winning anime that has made itself a staple in this community of lonely weebs.",False,anime,1707014062.0,1aid8my

I'm hoping that by some insane chance, this happens to be someones favorite movie or they recently watched it.. but the main reason why it's been SO hard for me to find it is because I remember basically NOTHING. Over the past years, I've forgotten more and more about it so this is the only thing I remember about it;

In one part of the movie, it was either near the beginning or somewhere in the middle, a father abandons his two children on a boat in the middle of the night. I think they were near a light house, but I'm not sure (my head is also telling me that the mom was dead, and was part of the reason as to why the dad abandons them). I *think* the two children are girl (older sister) and boy (younger brother) and I think the kids were sleeping when the father took them there and left them, and then the older sister wakes up and calls for her father but he obviously doesn't answer. (And if i remember correctly (which i probably dont) the anime style was similar to studio ghibli)

Stuff that I've searched over the years in hopes of finding this were mostly just ""dad abandons dos his children in the middle of the night anime movie"" and stuff similar to that lol

Yes. This is literally the only thing I remember. I'm not expecting anyone to figure out what I'm talking about, as I honestly have started to feel like this movie doesn't even exist.. as I said earlier, over the years I have forgotten more and more about this movie, I used to remember more scenes, especially regarding this one, but because I took so long to ask for help (I've been meaning to ask for help with this for about two years now..) I remember little to nothing.
I'm not even sure if anyones gonna see this but I'm putting it here anyways just incase lol.

Help me Rent-a-Girlfriend veterans,What to Watch?,"Hello!

My favourite character archetype is tsundere so Rent-a-Girlfriend was recommended to me.

I watched up to episode 4 and Chizuru is a fun character to watch but my tolerance for the MC is shrinking.

Does the MC have any character development or does he stay this way throughout? I think I'll have to drop it if he does.

&#x200B;

I would welcome any alternative recommendations too. I've seen these animes: evangelion, toradora, nisekoi, UBW, kaguya-sama, railgun. Anything with a tsundere character.",False,anime,1706994462.0,1ai6956

What are some anime tropes you dislike?,Discussion,"basically just as the title says, are there any tropes in anime you don’t like? or any specific pet peeves?

i really don’t like the over exaggeration about food that characters do a lot (barring food wars for obvious reasons)

just something about the whole “*takes a bite* OH MY GOD ITS SOOO YUMMMYYY” irks me a little bit lol

i also don’t like those scenes where an anime character trips or something and they overreact, saying something like “owwww that really hurt :(“

or in action anime when the character totally has a lot of time to react to something, but they don’t, so they just end up getting the shit kicked out of them",False,anime,1706992405.0,1ai5gox
I am interested in a moe romance with good writing,What to Watch?,"Just saying that as I sometimes watch KeikenZumi/KimiZero itself, and don’t get me wrong as the show has some parts to it such as the artwork, like say Runa’s character design,  BUT to me personally, I feel like the show could’ve used stronger or more compelling writing.



My point being is that while the show itself is alright, I feel like there are ways that the show could’ve been a bit more interesting with its overall plot, so now I want to see if there is a moe style romance anime that is a bit more engaging to watch, but I don’t know how to explain it as I just want a romantic anime with very solid writing, or at least some conflict in it.",False,anime,1706992220.0,1ai5e9y

Help. I’m depressed after watching Oshi no ko! 😭,Help,"So, I binged the first 3 books in the manga and the watched the series. Now, ever since I watched it I’ve been feeling depressed. Idk if this is the right place to put this post or not but I seemed like it idk. Ever since I finished them I’ve almost felt like my life isn’t living up to what I feel it should be. I felt such a connection and love for the places and characters of the series and turned around at my life and realizes it’s nothing like that. I live in a suburban area, pretty wealthy, very rustic and farmhouse like. I like big cities such as Tokyo, and I love trees and other such things like that. Although it’s sunny and that normally cheers me up every time I look outside I get depressed. It’s almost as if I’m longing for the the places the characters have gone idk. This could also have something to do with it currently being Saturday and it breaking my high school sophomore schedule I do almost everyday.

Help with domains in jujutsu kaisen,Help," 

After first season I thought I had everything figured out, but now I started second season and I got confused. In first season it seemed that all this strange creatures are curses. Little bit strange, but ok, thats the lore alright. But now I hear there are also cursed ghosts and some things that were called curses are now called cursed ghosts. So wtf? Did the author change conception or I missed something?

Second thing are domains. From first season I understood that they are spaces in which powers of its creators are enhanced and cannot miss. But in the second season when gojo fights in subway, they talk about enhancing and extending domains, but no different spaces appear. So Im guessing they can shape domains however they like and just cover their bodies with it. Also, the creator of domain can use his abilities inside of it, but he can't when he expands or enhances it. Is that right? Oh and also contact with domain forces other fighter to cancel any technique they are using. Do you also have feeling that the author expands certain ideas on the go and doesn't properly explain them?",False,anime,1706986808.0,1ai3dem

The English Dub lip sync of the Scott Pilgrim anime,Discussion,"I notice something interesting about the Scott Pilgrim anime. You see, when you watch anime in the original Japanese, you notice that what the characters are saying don't always match the lip flaps, which is seen as acceptable. After all, the animation is done before the dialogue is recorded. This is opposed to English dubs that always try sync the dialogue with the mouth movements so it doesn't look amateur to Western eyes.

However, they didn't do that with this anime. The English actors are sometimes a bit loose when they start and stop talking like the Japanese actors. I don't know another professionally done English dub that has gone this route.",False,anime,1706985088.0,1ai2qgb

"Is Andy, from undead unluck, perhaps the best user of regeneration ability in all of fiction?",Discussion,"I just realized that Andy, from undead unluck, might actually be the best user of the Regen ability, not just in terms of creativity but also in terms of regeneration speed, in all of fiction

The only characters that even come close to his level in terms of regeneration to my knowledge are wolverine, the hulk, Deadpool, Koro sensei and Buu. The most impressive feat I know of would be when Buu regenerated from a single cell, and I don't have any reason to think Andy can't do it too.

Meanwhile, Andy's here casually regenerating fast enough to shoot a finger at a speed comparable to a bullet (if not at the actual speed of a bullet), regenerating entire limbs, and even his whole body, in a second, and shooting blood with enough force to defy gravity and fly. And if you add to it his extremely creative use of his regen ability like making clones by regenerating his body from each finger he cuts off, flying by producing blood in high volumes (that's how I understand it but I might be incorrect), or even supressing his memories, is there really any character that can top Andy when it comes to regeneration?",False,anime,1706983373.0,1ai230b

The Reason Why the Payoff in Mushoku Tensei S2 Cour 1 is Very Satisfying.,Discussion,"I think the author is doing something very smart here. See the author has said he himself believes there are two types of love ""Eros"" and ""Agape""; eros being sexual and agape being emotional. What we see in this story is the author playing out his ""views"" on love using rudy as a surrogate. Rudy comes into this world having only known ""eros"". he is deeply entrenched in porn addiction, and jacking off. He sexualizes everyone when he comes into this world, the first time we see him grow out of his perversion is with Roxy, when he developed something akin to Agape love for her, a deep respect and spiritual attachment. even sylphy got the ""eros"" beem when he found out she was a girl, it's why she didn't want to be around him because he was acting like a creepy old man. To say nothing for Eris, who he defiantly views as only an object of lust. Until her 10th birthday...

The journey back from the demon continent was necessary because it removed him from his family. The Notos family were steeped in Eros. Even his father is a creature of Eros. But the journey back from the demon continent the only adult male supervision he got was from a man who protected children, and who would not let Rudy take advantage of Eris in that way. The multiyear journey changes rudy and he develops deep ""Agape"" love for Eris. and only then was he able to gain ""sex"" and lost his virginity.

The author believes in Balance between Agape and Eros, and Rudy was a creature in Imbalance. Taking Eris away broke him again. But it was needed because Eris ready and willing around him would have fed his Eros badly. See how he struggles to resolve his ED. it's all through Eros solutions. Prostitutes, ready sex friends, the walking embodiment of Eros strolls into his life in Elaniese and even she couldn't ""get a rise"" out of him.

This was the author making it clear the solution wasn't in Eros. So he goes to the magic school and meets Fitz. A gender neutral character. THIS IS IMPORTANT, Fitz is literally ASEXUAL in appearance. He/She is not lewd, is not lewded, he she isnt shown provocatively, he covers almost all of his skin even wearing gloves, he hides his eyes his hair is a neutral white, he barely talks, his voice is gender neutral, the point is you can't find ""eros"" in fitz. And to drive the lesson home, we have the beast girls, living hentai bait, they're willing to have sex with rudy if he's serious about it, but he's not serious about it. he's trying to use them for ""eros"" purposes. feeling their chests, and up their skits, but it doesn't work.

Instead Rudy finds Agape love with fitz. and when Agape love comes back into his heart guess what is ready for Eros... his little rudy.

This isn't a statement about LGBTQ+ or alternate sexualities. this is about the nature of love itself. This is about the two components the author believes are most important to true lasting love. Eros and Agape. And it's an important part of fixing what was broken about the broken person who was reborn in this world. In order to fix him properly his view on love and sex needed to be retrained properly.

-NOTE: the author is NOT against Eros. Perversion and sexual fetishes are a part of everyone. And they're part of the characters of this world. The author isn't saying that's BAD. What he's saying is it's BAD for rudy to get ""easy"" eros... because what he was from the old world was crippled and broken in spirit, and part of that unbalanced and crippled spirit was a porn addiction, an addiction to Eros. This is why this whole arc is here. This is about the reformation of Rudy's relationship with love and sex. with him developing a healthy relationship with both.

Credit to @arizona_anime_fan for the incredible comment and also hope that this will make you appreciate more the story of Mushoku Tensei.",False,anime,1706972511.0,1ahy0nd
What are the best / your favorite animated fights?,Discussion," 

Animating    fights is incredibly difficult, with all of the complex choreography,    dynamic movement, and special effects that they might involve. We've   all  seen our fair share of still frames and drawn-out monologues. But   once  in a while, a team absolutely sells out to deliver the smoothest,   most  action-packed fight that just makes you think, ""how did they *make*    that?"" Animation also has the distinct advantage of not being  tethered   to things like ""physics"" or ""reality,"" with the things on  screen  bounded  only by the imagination of the director and the  salaries of the   animators. It feels like every year, the industry gets  better and  better  at animating incredible moments, at least when they  really want  to. **What  are your  favorite  animated fights or action sequences, based purely on   animation,  choreography, and cinematography, without regard for  context?** Here are some of my favorites that come to mind:

* [Levi vs. the Beast Titan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0sqfPkCcyM) (Attack on Titan)

Anime that explore magic like Frieren?,What to Watch?,"I don't usually watch fantasy anime. In the past I even hate the fantasy genre. Mostly because the power scaling doesn't make sense. And sometimes like, how did this dude get his power? A few episode ago he got his ass beaten and now suddenly he can defeat the villain? 

But, when I watch Frieren, I really like the way they explore magic in the anime. 

Also, I don't know if this is relevant or not because it has no magic, but, other fantasy anime I like is Made in Abyss. 

Also 2, sorry my english is not that good.

Edit : I just woke up and holy fucking shit there's so many replies. Thank you everyone for the suggestion. 

I see a lot of you recommend Mushoku Tensei. I've watched season 1 of it a while ago but for different reason. I remember watching Gigguk's video and he said it's the best isekai or something like that. So I give it a try. Back then I don't really pay attention to the magic. I guess I should rewatch the season 1 and check out season 2. Also regarding Rudeus, I know a lot of you don't like his character. But, for me that's not a problem at all. I'm not trying to self insert myself into every anime I watch. 

I also see some of you mentioned HxH. I've watched that anime years ago also for different reason. While I think it's a good anime it's not really what I'm looking for right now. 

I think I agree with some of you saying I maybe looking for anime with soft magic system. 

Edit 2 : I know Frieren is not mainly about magic. It's a slice of life kinda anime about her relation to her party member. About a passage of time. Don't get me wrong, I like that part of the anime too. But I also really like the magic aspect of it. And that's what I'm looking for right now. ",False,anime,1706959251.0,1ahtzk9

"I swear, speed is never scaled properly in most animes",Discussion,"I’m sorry but I’m here to rant.

&#x200B;

* I hate when there are people with energy blasts or light rays attacks, it always seems to travel at the same speed as bullets, like in Star wars. Then there are the fans of an anime that suggest that a character is as fast or faster than the speed of light just because that character either 1: seems to be fast or 2: dodges a light/energy blast.
* Then there are the idiots that think teleportation is a type of travel speed. Teleportation is instantaneous, you get from point A to point B with no travel time, and where there is no travel time, there is no travel speed involved as such.
* If something is moving at light speed, we won't be able to see it moving at light speed as our eyes wont have time to process a moving object going that fast. meaning, it would be invisible. So if we can see moving, it is not moving at the speed of light. This should also apply to characters in an anime, so if a character is moving at light speed, other characters, should not be able to be aware or perceive this as well. (NARUTO STOPPING TRAIN)
* Then there are the characters that are supposed to be scaled to light speed but the mangaka doesn't know how to display it properly. (KIZARU)
* And the only way to become as fast as the speed of light, is if you don't have any mass, otherwise things just do not work. Only way to become light-speed is if you turn into light particles, as light does not carry any mass. (GOOD EXAMPLES: KIZARU AND SHINRA)

&#x200B;

Yeah thats it. I just get irritated sometimes when I see fans comments suggesting some characters are scaled to lightspeed, mainly characters from NARUTO AND ONE PIECE.",False,anime,1706939938.0,1ahp6ds

Ending songs are underrated and I’m tired of it,Discussion,"We all like openings, but I feel like I’m in the minority who thinks a good ending song enhances the experience of watching a series. 
Despite being usually slower, they often represent something deeper about that specific anime, like hinting at the overarching themes and message of the story. And reinforcing a tone for the story/arc being covered. It makes me think EDs are often more honest about what the anime is about than the OP. 

They can also be just as good at foreshadowing as whether it be showing characters yet to appear or events that have yet to happen. 

Letting the song creep in before the episode ends is by far one of my favorite techniques common in anime, or just inserting it into a dramatic or emotional scene. There are just too many good editing tricks that can be done. (Ex: Re Zero, Attack on Titan, FMAB)

Changing the song also is an incredible way to mark a shift in the progression of the story. From either a cour 1 to cour 2, or switching seasons all together. The first ED may be more upbeat and whimsical, while the second is more serious and somber. Re Zero again exemplified this near perfectly. 

Lastly, they also just great for linking the audience to the show. Like highlighting important moments of said episode (ie Lycoris Recoil) to sell either emotion or character relationships even more. 

So next time you are about to skip, at least give it a watch once. A 1:30 seconds isn’t going to kill you.",False,anime,1706931637.0,1ahmpek
I'm looking for a reference for an animation I'm working on. Can you help?,Help,"Looking for a moment in anime where it cuts to a close up of a characters foot hitting the ground, then cut to a wide shot of them running. Like a burst.

What happened to the Buddyfight dub?,Help,"
I don’t know if anyone else remembers this show, let alone the mystery I’m referring to. However, this is something that’s been nagging at me for ages, and yet I’ve been unable to find a clear answer.

Let me explain. The show was called Future Card Buddyfight. It was a tie-in for a Yugioh type game that was unfortunately discontinued a few years ago. I was a huge fan of the show as a kid, until late 2015, when halfway through the second season, the English Dub abruptly stopped. They just started posting episodes in Japanese with subs, the dub wouldn’t resume until the fourth season, with the episodes between this point never getting dubbed.

As far as I can tell, there was never any official word on why this happened, nor have I been able to find any comments or interviews from members of the English cast on the matter. I doubt this matters to anyone else, but I Just can’t get out of my head. This is something that made kid me walk away from what once was one of his favorite shows. Simply put, I want to find out what happened to the Buddyfight dub.",False,anime,1706926371.0,1ahl0yt

I already knew what I was getting into because he made some weird hentai. That anime was unique enough that I watched it and gave it 7. I am also into watching weird anime, so that why I gave it 7.

edit: look like some people didn't understand what 6 or below means. When I said 6 or below, I didn't mean 6.7, 6.9, 6.4.etc. When I said 6 I mean 6, no decimals and below means all rating that goes below 6 like 5.4, 1.3, 4.4 etc. ",False,anime,1706918460.0,1ahibsf

**Questions of the Day:**

1) Can you think of an even pettier reason for Kentaro Mahara to have done all of this?

2) If you could pick a different AI based on an existing Gundam character to appear here, which one would you have liked to see?

3) On a scale of 1 to 10, how absolutely *badass* was Graham cutting that Dainsleif in half? [](#doggo)

"How did the anime art style start, and become the staple?",Discussion,"Ive been looking at the history of anime just out of curiousity, but im not finding a lot on how the actual art style came to be, and why (most) every anime follows the same style for the most part.  Ofc theres variants depending on the artist and whatnot, but the overall design is pretty consistent.  Why?  Western cartoons/animation have a pretty varried artstyle, which is what inspired anime in the first place.  So how and why is anime its own style?

Animes where 2 opposing factions in a conflict fight and where you can sympathize with both sides.,What to Watch?,"Having watched ""Legend of the Galactic Heroes"" I am looking for more animes that have 2 opposing factions fighting each other (for whatever reason) and none of the 2 factions are portrayed as the villains, allowing you to root for and sympathize with characters on both sides of the conflict.  


Preferably no battle-shonen, even though animes like Fate/Zero or Juuni Taisen would theoretically fit my criteria, as there are multiple characters fighting each other, multiple of whom you'd like to see win.

The Dangers In My Heart,Discussion,"I know I’m late to the party, but I’m currently on episode 10 of season 1 of Dangers In My Heart. And wow. Just wow. I trusted others opinion, but I didn’t expect this anime to exceed those expectations 100x. This is one of the best most wholesome romance anime I have ever watched (and I’ve watched sooo many). Everything about it is a masterpiece. They nailed the reality of relationships, the slow burn makes you connect with it on a whole nother level. I love the relatability of the mc. I love how just because he starts talking to this girl and befriends her that he doesn’t all of the sudden break out of his shell and gain a bunch of friends, he’s still a loner, which is way more realistic to me. (I hate how other romance anime tend to follow that trope of I was a loner but I made one friend now I’m super social and have a whole group of friends?) It makes me feel less bad about being a loner myself. The fact that he had such dark thoughts before but then they slowly fade away when he experiences these new feelings, is so real. I love Yamada and her whole personality and how he sees the true her because he’s not focused on the surface level things. I love that he’s not some hottie and that he’s shorter than her. I could go on and on. The only other romance anime that come close to giving me this good of a feeling while watching, that feels real, that are so wholesome are: “Kimi Ni Todoke” and “Skip and Loafer”. This for sure is one of my favorite anime now. Thank you to people who suggested it, thank you anime gods, thank you to Shin-Ei animation.",False,anime,1706891330.0,1ah7p4q

Paranoia Agent 20th Anniversary Rewatch One Day Reminder,Rewatch,"Hey, guys. Holofan4life here. 

I am pleased to announce that I will be hosting the 20th anniversary rewatch of Paranoia Agent

##What is Paranoia Agent about?

The infamous Shounen Bat is terrorizing the residents of Musashino City. Flying around on his rollerblades and beating people down with a golden baseball bat, the assailant seems impossible to catch—much less understand. His first victim, the well-known yet timid character designer Tsukiko Sagi, is suspected of orchestrating the attacks. Believed only by her anthropomorphic pink stuffed animal, Maromi, Tsukiko is just one of Shounen Bat's many victims.

As Shounen Bat continues his relentless assault on the town, detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa begin to investigate the identity of the attacker. However, more and more people fall victim to the notorious golden bat, and news of the assailant begins circulating around the town. Paranoia starts to set in as chilling rumors spread amongst adults and children alike.

Will the two detectives be able to unravel the truth behind Shounen Bat, or will the paranoia get to them first?

##Why should I watch Paranoia Agent?

Paranoia Agent is the brainchild of Satoshi Kon. He is the director of acclaimed films such as Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, and Tokyo Godfathers. This is his one and only TV show he was the creator and director for. I've really been getting into his work as of late, and I really want to check out the TV show he created. And what better timing given it's the 20 year anniversary than to watch it with you guys?

I also like mecha anime in general, even though I've not seen that many. I'm kind of looking for a mecha anime that centers around a diverse team, rather than ""the one big mecha"" or a team of almost copypaste mechas, working together, substituting their shortcomings.

Anyone know of any shows of movies that fit the bill?

Looking for animes similar to…,What to Watch?,"
- attack on titan
- my hero academia 
- saiki k
- erased

Okay off the bat I know this is a super disorganized post :(( Ik the 4 shows I listed are all over the place and very dissimilar, but they are the only animes I ever liked (tbf I haven’t seen many) and I’ll list the reasons why I like them

- AOT - one the greatest shows ever imo. The writing was amazing especially the plottwists. My favorite thing tho was the message of the show: *the world is cruel but I still love you* 

- MHA - I love the world building of the show and all the characters are so loveable! I rly like school animes (is that what they’re called?) bc I enjoy the normalcy they provide. Also, i rly enjoy the messaging of this show: *what does it mean to be a hero?*

- Saiki k - this one is so silly and random haha but also very sweet. Again like MHA there’s something comforting abt the monotony of Saiki K, as opposed to the constant plot twists and high stakes of a show like AOT

- Erased - tbh I don’t remember much since I watched it a while ago but I enjoyed the plot twists !

Looking at these, I think what I want in an anime is some sort of found family situation, a classroom environment, good writing w lots of plot twists, and some sort of “deep message” that makes u think. Idk if this makes any sense but I’d appreciate if u guys would share any of ur recommendations! Thank u sm!!

Additional info: Animes that I’ve started & dropped (but am willing to start again!)
- Naruto 
- JJK
- Cowboy bebop 
- Bluelock 
- Haikyuu",False,anime,1706872865.0,1ah1ful

Does anyone enjoy watching weekly rather than binging a show?,Discussion,"Another post from earlier was talking about why the anime Pluto was rather unpopular, and one of the main reasons for this being that all the episodes were released at once. Which apparently generally generates less online discussion then shows where the episodes air weekly. 

&#x200B;

So anyway, it got me thinking, does anyone actually prefer watching a show weekly? I personally just can't comprehend that, but I guess if you're really looking forward to the online responses and discussions for each individual episode it could make sense. But for me personally, if there's a show I like, I'd always wish I could binge it all lol.

I can’t decide what to watch next,What to Watch?,"I’ve recently finish Naruto, and I love it so so much. A lot of that is due to nostalgia because I watched a ton as a kid, but regardless I think think it’s amazing.

My second favourite anime all time next to Naruto is easily Hunter x Hunter. Gon and Killua are such amazing characters and the story is so interesting and just drives me in.

I’m currently in the arrancar arc in Bleach, and a few dozen chapters into Dragonball, and at about Enies Lobby for One Piece. I’ve found them all to be pretty good to this point, but none have pulled me in enough to really commit to.

Bleach is good but lacks personality imo. I also know that opinions are quite divided on the most recent arcs so it makes it harder for me to get through some of the more dragged on stuff

One Piece has been quite good as well, the issue is that everything feels inconsequential since I know most if not all of the main big spoilers. It makes everything with Luffy, Zoro, Sanji etc. feel almost pointless since I know there are no stakes.

For Dragonball honestly I’ve been quite enjoying all of it so far. My concern is more just with the fact that it seems like the anime drops off at some point. I don’t mind reading unit generally I like the big moments to be well animated which is why idk about Dragonball lol.

I was on a high after finishing Attack on Titan and I’ve calmed down after Spy X Family,What to Watch?,"I am having a really hard time finding an anime that I’d like to watch because both AOT and Spy X Family were really really good, and now I have no idea how to keep watching anime on the same level. 

My sister has been trying to get me to watch one piece but idk I’m not really vibing with it and I’m having a hard time getting started. I’d like an anime that starts off strong, and will get me excited to keep watching the whole time. A lot of anime I’ve heard are good take a while to get going and I’m not necessarily looking for that.

I’m really craving a series with the same level of graphic design, unique lore and world building, mystery and complexity as attack on Titan. After watching what’s currently available for spy x family, I’m ready to get back into a proper series that’s more action and mystery heavy. I liked spy x family cause it was a unique topic and I enjoy “governmental” anime.

I have watched a good chunk of anime, here is is my rough top 10 (not including any movies, or series still in progress in most cases):

1. Attack on Titan 

2. Full Metal Alchemist 

3. Soul Eater 

4. Death Note

5. Naruto and Shippuden

6. Bleach + Thousand Year Blood War (So Far)

7. Spy X Family

8. Tokyo Ghoul (would honestly be higher but the “show” aspect itself sucked. If I read manga I would probably enjoy its manga WAY more.)

9. Fairy Tail or Black Clover

10. Seraph of The End or Blue Exorcist

To be honest, I have watched a good chunk of anime but I’m still a novice. There are many other series I have seen that I’m sure are better than what I listed but I’m just not remembering them if that makes sense. I’m only confident in my top 4. 

The thing is for me what happened is I watched a lot of anime when I was like 12-14 and then I just stopped and then I started again middle of last year but most of it was rewatching old series. 

Idk if I had to summarize what I’m looking for: “An action/drama Anime with a unique world and concept which involves a complex and dark mystery. Involves a government and politics, with an MC who is not cancerous. A modern art style is strongly preferred. ( I’d prefer something a little more mature, but I don’t enjoy fan service anime. )”

I tried getting into JJK but I’m not impressed by the first few episodes. I’m not really looking for a regular battle shonen but I may try JKK another time.

Recently started Vinland Saga. I am interested but I’ve been in the mood for more fantasy rn.

Good anime with bad/misleading titles that turn people away?,Discussion,"I was thinking about this a while back watching DanMachi season 4. It's alternative title, Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon - actually threw me off for a long time. I didn't start watching the series until season 4 came out. And while the first 2 seasons weren't quite as good, it certainly was not what I expected. Then s3 came and I really liked it, then s4 was such a banger I was hooked! I also have a guilty pleasure for watching fantasy anime with OP MC's. Whether it's isekai or non isekai, (also bonus if actual romance involved with a clear choice/the romance actually goes somewhere) a lot of them are definitely generic and similar but for some reason, I like them lol. It's not that I think they're all great, I just enjoy watching them for something to watch. But there's a lot of those that have really awful names as well. One I rewatched recently was 'The greatest demon lord is reborn as a typical nobody' and while the first half was pretty generic, I really liked the tone shift at the end (even if the time travel stuff had a few plot holes). The characters were fun as well. But again, the name sounded so..generic and blah, so it took me a while to watch. 

I think DanMachi's alternate title people know it by  is one of the most popular titles that people agree with being very poor and misleading for the most part. Any other shows come to mind specifically?

Edit - another one I forgot was Chivalry of a Failed Knight. While the name actually does make some amount of sense once you watch, I thought it was going to be a waaaay different show after watching the first minute and going off the name of the show. I figured it would be some generic romance where nothing kicks off until the last episode where they finally admit they like each other. 

I was very surprised that 1) the romance blossomed quickly and the ""tsundere"" heroine was actually a great character and 2) the ""failed knight"" had way more about him than just being a..failure. the fights were also surprisingly pretty hyped and the last fight was mega hype. I wish we had more of it ;(",False,anime,1706849377.0,1agvkes

I love Piano no Mori, for it introduces classical music in a form that adds meaning and thought behind the pieces of music being played. As a kid I never liked classical music and before this anime I never cared to understand it, now I love it and listen to it on a regular basis!

I love Your lie in April, for it touches upon a tough and difficult to comprehend topic. Death and how it can affect people around you, but more than that, it tells a story on how to rebuild oneself, either by people around you, by accepting reality and or by doing the thing you care about most.

Getting sad/empty feeling after finishing anime.,Help,"

Hello, so I just wanted to know how can I distract myself / help myself from moving on with sad/empty feelings after watching anime (I know that the best thing to cure something is time but other than that?)

Some info:
I just finished 3 days ago The Eminence In Shadow season 2 which was ok didn't really leave that much of empty / sad feeling, I started watching a new anime the same day, which was the one that gave me this emptiness... 
I started watching Heavenly Delusion, and I just loved it, and I honestly think a little bit of that emptiness and sadness came from Reddit 😂, since i was googling to see when season 2 is out and to know a little about just some info about the anime, and then I see Reddit comments about people understanding so much about what happened in the anime that the anime itself didn't explain very well, some things that shocked me but can't say here cause of spoilers. So yeah anyways just the fact that I didn't watch an apocalyptic movie/anime or whatever in a long time already kicked me but also the little romanticism, the heart dropping cruel scene, and the plot itself, and ALSO the 300 questions that just popped in my head is making it difficult to relax, I really enjoy watching anime and I have a few series already ready to watch tomorrow if I get better, also there the FACT that Heavenly Delusion was released in spring 2023 so we won't see the 2 season for a long time probably.

Digimon Adventure 25th Anniversary Rewatch Interest Thread,Rewatch,"Hello everybody. Normally a person would think that after hosting a pretty long Rewatch, one would take a break and take things easy. Alas I am not normal and Anniversaries call me. 2024 marks the 25th Anniversary of Digimon Adventure, and you bet we're gonna be here to celebrate it with a Rewatch.

Of course, some of you may ask...

---

#**So what are these Digimon things?**

Digimon, short for Digital Monsters, is a Series of V-Pet games… as in, Tamogatchi-esque stuff, for the normies. You have your little device thing and a Monster's inside it and you have to raise it. It'll probably die if you don't do your job properly (Or will die anyway… hey, that's how life works), so… do it properly. The game eventually exploded in popularity, leading to videogames, Mangas, and, of course, Animes.

However at the end of the day, Digimon stories, to me, are first and foremost meant to be an Adventure. No matter what, this is a Franchise that should strive to instill a sense of wonder upon the viewer, and all the best installments of the franchise, in my opinion, have done so. And of course, here we are to watch the one that started it all…

Yes I know about V-Tamer, shut up, that doesn't have an Anime so we'll have to make due with this. ~~V-Tamer rocks though, so read it when you get a chance.~~

---

#**Okay but what is Digimon Adventure?**

In a world just like ours, in the year 1999, there were 7 Kids in a Summer Camp, [the hot-headed Yagami Taichi, resident tomboy Takenouchi Sora, the loner Ishida Yamato, the genius boy Izumi Koshiro, the spoiled and bubbly Tachikawa Mimi, the crybaby Takaishi Takeru and the debatably reliable Kido Jou](https://i.imgur.com/IFns6D0.png), witnessed a strange event as it suddenly started snowing… in the middle of summer. However as they went outside to check what was going on, they ended up being dragged by a strange force into a whole new world, one populated by the strange creatures known as Digimons. These children must now find their way back home, and in the way, discover the many wonders of this brand new world.

If the premise didn't spell it out for you, yes, Digimon Adventure is a fucking Isekai. That being said, it predates the modern concept of it by a good few years, thus a lot of the tropes don't really apply here. The kids for one thing are *genuinely* helpless when the Digimons aren't around, meaning they oftentimes have to use their wit to get out of trouble until the Kaiju fights start. Also, yes, the heroes are all kids and they very much act like it: These kids are far from the pinnacle of maturity and are prone to doing really dumb, stupid shit as a result.

Given how this is a kids show, the tone is relatively light, however it is very much commendable how willing it is to tackle very real subjects that can sometimes trouble kids with a surprising amount of maturity. The show always treats its audience with respect, and while obviously the setting is fairly fantastical, the sources of many of the kids' problems can be eerily relatable.

In spite of all that though, at the end this is very much a fun roadtrip first and foremost. The world of the Digimons is just such a lively place that it's hard not to be engaged by it, it helps that it is very well rendered out visually. The actual animation is… not the best, mind, but if nothing else you always have [the late great Arisawa Takamori's OST](https://myanimelist.net/people/7424/Takanori_Arisawa) to keep you entertained during the higher stake moments.

---

#**Okay, where to watch it?**

Uh… yeah this is where the problem starts. As far as I can tell, there are no streaming service on this side of the world that have the show in full. Now to be clear, recently [Discotek did release the show in Blu-Ray](https://www.amazon.com/Adventure-Complete-Japanese-Language-Collection/dp/B0C47ZWJYD), but of course that means shelling out over 60 bucks which I know some of you may not be comfortable doing. So… [yeah](#piracy)

---

#**Wait, what are you talking about, isn't the show on Hulu?**

[About that… ](#godisdead)

See, Hulu does indeed have the show… it's just dubbed only and I'm sorry to say, I cannot recommend it for this Rewatch. It was done by Saban in the early 2000' and let's just say it is pretty heavily cut down. Not only is the whole music replaced entirely with one that was, to be frank, far worse, but more importantly the script has taken a bit of a hit, being considerably dumbed down and just generally being unable to stay quiet. Therefore, for this Rewatch specifically just… don't bother.

---

#**Well, fine. So when are we watching this?**

We'll start on March 6th, not with the show, but rather with [the pilot movie directed by Hosoda Mamoru](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2961/Digimon_Adventure_Movie). After that we'll watch the show proper, then the *other* movie, [Our War Game](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2397/Digimon_Adventure__Bokura_no_War_Game) and then we'll have a final discussion on. Combine this with a break day right before the second movie and we have the Rewatch lasting from **March 6th-May 2nd**, with threads being posted daily at 9pm UTC (That's 4pm EST when it starts before switching to 5pm EST when daylight saving ends).

---

#**NO SPOILERS**

This show isn't the most plot-twist heavy, but nonetheless be careful when talking about spoilers. If you'll do so (Or aren't sure if it is a spoiler), then use the little spoiler code thingy as indicated on the side of the Subreddit. Do note you'll have to switch to the Markdown Server or old Reddit as the fancy pants one breaks the formatting. Oh well, it's just something that must be done...

S2 drops and everything was fine till the ship-game-test episode comes up and holy shit they prepared a whole ass 'Rare steak on a 2* Michellin chef handpressed and delicately prepared 99% whole wheat pizza topped with 79 year old exquisite cheese sause on top'...... when I asked for a €10 mozzarella (maybe a fungi) pizza. I'm not gonna be in the state of mind at night after work to be able to understand how Cicada 3301 was cracked. They cooked the  gameplay/test rule hard AF. My expectations of MC were misplaced, which again was my wrong expectations, except for maybe the last episode or so when he fought the other guy (ig ??). 

NOT SAYING THE ANIME WAS BAD! it was not for me.

So a  very long time ago my brother had a lot of Anime on his PC, Most shows i didn't really like until i stumbled on 2, ive been trying to find them but i have looked for hours unsuccessfully and hoping someone can help.  


the first was a show about a male in his teens. He very immature young adult.   
His (i believe its his aunt if i remember correctly) for some reason drops a little girl off with him and he has to take care of her. i remember it being a story of how he grows as a person, ends up dating a girl with all the jokes being around the little girl. like she would sometimes get jealous ect.

&#x200B;

the second at first reminded me a little of naruto but then ended up being something very different. was a samurai kind of guy with a straw hat i think(sorry my memory is bad) but it was somewhat dark. the main character was a good guy that just went around helping people but unlike most anime he did not hesitate to kill the ""bad"" guys. I remember watching it and thinking that it was more realistic in its world to what would happen if people had ""powers"".  There was even a scene where 2 people with powers where fighting and the one won and ended up raping the other. think it was a plant lady of some sort. (and no it wasn't hentia, you don't see it, it just sort of implies it.)

"What anime handled the ""Amnesia"" arc/trope/plot the best and the worst?",What to Watch?,"This is half looking for recommendations and half discussion.

A while back, I spoke with a friend and they just casually talked and ranted about how much they **hated** when an anime or story in general handles amnesia. They mentioned how most of the time, it feels like a regression of character and that it's hardly (if ever at all) done properly, and it's always used to create drama for the sake of it. 

I didn't initially think much of it until I saw this comment on a completely unrelated post which said roughly the same things. It could've been a coincidence, but I just wanted to read more into it. Which is when I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/17zjdzk/why_does_everybody_hate_the_amnesia_trope/) in r/writing from just recently. Seems the common viewpoint it's rarely done properly or some even said isn't a trope that has much to offer. Now I'm curious if whether the amnesia plot has ever worked well in anime cause truth be told, I don't see a lot of anime with amnesia despite it being labelled as overused. 

Also half discussion cause I want to see you guys' insights. Since you'll be naming one or two examples from anime, I was hoping you could share what made x-anime handle the amnesia aspect better than y-anime. Thanks!",False,anime,1706809220.0,1aggpxi

I find the concept really appealing but I can’t remember the anime name.. does this ring a bell to anyone? ( I lost contact with that person so I can’t ask him directly)

Also, I would additionally like your suggestion on a good isekai to watch. I’ve finished all the available episodes of overlord and eminece in the shadows… im open to any other suggestion except SAO. 
Thanks in advance for your help.",False,anime,1706805319.0,1agf550

Calm and “Beautiful” anime for 8 year old nephew?,What to Watch?,"My nephew has recently gotten a bit anime obsessed via Ghibli movies and I would love some recommendations of stuff to watch with him, films or series.

His favourites have been Totoro and Kiki’s Delivery Service because, in his words, they are “beautiful”. From talking with him I think he likes the calm, mostly conflict and threat free nature of them, combined with the amazing artwork in those films. He’s very emotionally intelligent and the characters journeys in those films really resonate with him.

He didn’t much like Castle in The Sky because it had too much action, and he really didn’t like Spirited Away because of some of the more alarming elements like the pig parents and No Face. 

So any recommendations for calm, no violence, low threat, quietly moving anime with fantastic artwork?

(EDIT: I should have said, those with good English dub only. I don’t think his reading level could keep up with the speed of subs.)",False,anime,1706804429.0,1agesjq

"Newer to Anime, Looking For Recommendations-Feeling Lukewarm About Some",What to Watch?,"Hello, firstly I wanna say I love this sub-you guys are extremely helpful! I also understand that it’s frustrating to recommend something without parameters so this is gonna be a bit long.

I’m newer to anime, just started watching last year, and I’ve watched a decent amount so far, but I’m hungry for more!

Here’s what I’ve watched so far:
Attack on Titan (need to watch last 2 episodes)
Tokyo Ghoul
Code Geass
Chainsaw Man
Blood Lad 
Castlevania
Banana Fish
Neon Genesis Evangelion
Devilman Crybaby
Hellsing Ultimate
Noblesse
Death Note
Berserk (1997) (2016-17)
Parasyte: the Maxim
High School of the Dead
SpyXFamily (haven’t watched season 3 yet)
The Devil is a Part-Timer! (Through Season 3)
Servamp
The Case Study of Vanitas (through part 2)
Mignon
Blassreiter
Terror in Resonance
Steins;Gate
Cowboy Bebop (currently watching)

Movies:
Code Geass: Re;surrection
Weathering With You
A Silent Voice
End of Evangelion
Evangelion (4 alternate universe movies)
Promare
Princess Mononoke
Howl’s Moving Castle
Laputa: Castle in the Sky
Grave of the Fireflies
Spirited Away
The Cat Returns
Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind
Whisper of the Heart
Ponyo
My Neighbor Totoro
Vampire Hunter D
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
Spriggan
Saezuru Tori Wa Habatakanai

To add more parameters:
-I usually HATE watching TV shows, especially long ones, so I would prefer a shorter one (If I have the option, I usually grind out entire TV shows in a week or two)
-I usually don’t like shows that are “unfinished” and prefer an anime that is finished or will be soon finished
-I love sadder/grittier stuff (LOVED Berserk, Grave of the Fireflies, A Silent Voice, Banana Fish)
-I LOVE vampire stuff, but only really like the more “lore-heavy, secret-society” vampire stuff (if that makes sense?)
-I’m not too fond of many of the “anime tropes” (don’t know what to call it)  but not a deal breaker!
-Of these above, Code Geass is probably my favorite and was my second anime I watched and I’m still chasing that high
-I thought Death Note and Steins;Gate were good, but they weren’t a good as praised to be honest although the rest of the anime I’ve watched I really enjoyed!
-I don’t really have a specific “genre” I’m looking for really, as my watch list has REALLY bounced around a lot
-gundam (just learned what that meant) is not my favorite, but is fine as long as it’s not the #1 focus of the anime

Also, I’ve been recommended the following anime, but I guess I feel “lukewarm” about them I guess?:
Monster
Legend of the Galactic Heroes
Japanese Tales of the Macabre
Demon Slayer
Iron Blooded Orphans: Mobile Suit Gundam
Vinland Saga
Psycho-Pass
86
Moriartry the Patriot 
Black Lagoon
Grand Blue Dreaming
Castlevania: Nocturne
Valkyria Chronicles
Innocent Venus
Another
To Your Eternity
Jormungand
Akame ga Kill!
Darker than Black
Linebarrels of Iron
Kuromukuro
Wolf’s Rain
Inuyasha
Bleach
Your Name

My qualms with: LOGH is that there’s a lot of episodes, Castlevania Nocturne, Moriarty the Patriot, and Psycho-Pass is that their stories aren’t “finished” yet so I’m hesitant to start them

So, after all that, I’m desperate for your help, if you have any recommendations please send them my way! Or should I just suck it up and watch what already on my recommended list? Thank you so much!

I’ll try my best to respond to any follow up questions in the comments or DMs!",False,anime,1706799281.0,1agctnh

Do you think anime waifus not being virgin can diminish her popularity among weebs?,Discussion,"Recently, I have been watching Monogatari series and SNAFU. Senjougahara and Yukino are easily among most loved waifus among all anime fans. There's no doubt about that. If there is scene that implies  these two got involved with any other dude (Kaiki and Hayato Hayama) other than MCs, then people who loved those waifus start to call her derogatory terms used to insult promiscuous women. They suddenly lose all forms of love and devotion they had for their waifus.

Full Metal Panic! for not a fan of mecha?,What to Watch?,"I had been dismissing anime with mecha among its genres for a long time, until I happened upon a gem that is Eighty-Six, which lead me to discover that not every show under the aforementioned lable involves big battle robots. And so I’ve been checking if that’s the case ever since. 

Then, fairly recently I somehow slipped into watching Trapped in a Dating Sim, which turned out to be an absolutely hilarious piece. That’s how I’ve come to realize that If the robots are explained with magic, not technology – they won’t bother me either. 

I still doubt I will ever be able to take seriously any solemn story in which big battle robots play a significant role, but having made previous steps, I’m now wondering if perhaps Full Metal Panic! could become the next one?

Who typically gets credited for their work in an anime episode and who doesn’t?,Discussion,"So at the end of a feature-length film, the credits are massive and it really feels like mostly everyone gets credited. But while we do see credits in usually the ED of each anime episode, I can’t help feel that they aren’t including everyone. I certainly don’t see all the names of the animators who worked on each episode. I am not sure if that is because there are more moving parts in anime as production is split on a per episode basis or if there is no real obligation to really do so.

So my questions are the following:

1. Who is responsible for overseeing the credits for each anime episode? Is there a name (romaji) for this job, and is this done during post production?

2. Freelancers do get contracted to work on a commercial anime. Yet we don’t see their name in the anime they helped make unlike subcontracted studios. Why is that?

3. Circling on that question, are credits determined by an obligation in a contract? 

4. Do credits have to appear on the anime episode or is there a legal document that lists everyone’s involvement in an anime episode? I say this because anime episodes that are aired on TV have a set time.

5. What happens when someone is supposed to appear in the credits, but was missed?",False,anime,1706753184.0,1afzld0

Any anime recommendations for non-shounen anime,What to Watch?,"As I've gotten older, I've come to enjoy anime less and less.

I've stopped watching all shounen animes because I can't get past this, but still love anime like Hellsing, Monster, Ghost in the Shell, Ergo Proxy, and Darker than Black. 

My question is, are there other anime genres that don't feel like the typical shounen where every character needs screentime gasping at how powerful the MC is every second?

Seasonal Comment Face Nominations - Winter 2024,Announcement,"#**Hey Everyone!~**

[](#modsalute)

We are once again into the depths of an exciting new season! So once again it is time to rotate the the seasonal comment faces. We will be accepting nominations till **midnight February 9 UTC**.

#***Give your feedback on the last seasons faces***

We have a [short survey form here](https://forms.gle/JoMr4UQLdLumDc7s8) to see what faces were liked and how they compared to the season before. ([Results viewable here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGbdpFohdBLmCLecxXPU5uuGpFDRg8sIlABnbLId4llYWAYA/viewanalytics))

[](#concealedexcitement)

#***Wait, what even IS a comment face?***

If you use Reddit's redesign, or any mobile app, then comment faces won't be something you see. They are a legacy CSS feature supported on [old.reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/). To post a face, you require a bit of formatting and the name of the comment face and that displays the relevant image. For example:
    
```[](#awe)```

Becomes: 

[](#awe)

[We have a full wikipage with all faces and instructions how to use them here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/commentfaces)

#***The seasonal faces are:***

[](#seasonalapproval) **#seasonalapproval** | [](#seasonalblush) **#seasonalblush** | [](#seasonalconfused) **#seasonalconfused** 
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:
[](#seasonalcool) **#seasonalcool** | [](#seasonaldepression) **#seasonaldepression** | [](#seasonaldisapproval) **#seasonaldisapproval** 
[](#seasonaldisdain) **#seasonaldisdain** | [](#seasonalfoodie) **#seasonalfoodie** | [](#seasonalhype) **#seasonalhype** 
[](#seasonallaugh) **#seasonallaugh** | [](#seasonallisten) **#seasonallisten** | [](#seasonallove) **#seasonallove** 
[](#seasonalneat) **#seasonalneat** | [](#seasonalpout) **#seasonalpout** | [](#seasonalshock) **#seasonalshock** 
[](#seasonalthink) **#seasonalthink** | [](#seasonaltired) **#seasonaltired** |

The named #themes are intended to be broadly interpreted. So we encourage you to submit great faces even if they don't perfectly match, as we may find a space for them. 


#***So how do I nominate a seasonal face?***

The series must be currently airing as part of this season, the image can be from a previous season if the show is a sequel. Movies/OVAs that have become accessible between seasonal nominations are allowed. To keep things diverse, we aim to pick one face per anime, so nominate those under watched gems!

Make as many nominations as you like as comments. Include the image, the name of the anime it is from and the #name(s) it fits for. If you like saving my time, [posting in this format is best.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/10vmhq8/seasonal_comment_face_nominations_winter_2023/j7invi2/)

Who were some prominent anime creators (or studios) who were gone too soon?,Discussion,"Forgive me for maybe a more... grim topic, but in a fit of boredom I found myself wandering to the AniList page for *Cat Soup* and had to ask*.* Today I learned that Masaaki Yuasa was a large part on why that short film cooks as hard as it does (which is cool), but I also learned the grim tale of Nekojiru (which is less cool).

A couple other rabbit holes later and here we are. I'm fascinated with the idea of the auteur and tracking the careers of prominent anime staff that always left their mark on whatever they touched. The grim side of that is that not every artist gets to ride off peacefully into the sunset. So I'm curious what other examples y'all have dug up of artists in the anime sphere who tragically met their end before their time? I know Satoshi Kon and Yasuhiro Takemoto are probably the most infamous examples, but are there any other names you want to draw attention to?

While we're at it, are there any studios or other creative entities you know that similarly seemed to burn out quickly but brightly? Kitty Films comes to mind as the production company that brought Rumiko Takahashi into the world of anime in the 80s only to fizzle out by the 90s or Manglobe that oversaw names like *Samurai Champloo, Michiko & Hatchin,* and *Ergo Proxy* throughout the 2000s before going defunct in 2015.",False,anime,1706741576.0,1afvbcq

The only thing I can gather from this is Netflix fucked up a premier they had nearly a year to prepare for and is just refusing to acknowledge it.



Edit: It appears there are 11 episodes finally on Netflix and it is searchable now. I don't know what they fucked up today but at least it's resolved. Would have been nice to have an acknowledgement from Netflix earlier though instead of just deleting their tweet from 1:00 AM about it being available. ",False,anime,1706738575.0,1afu3os

So I've been trying to find an anime that I watched way back, but my memory is hazy around the details. So this is a total hail mary.

The show is not newer than 2003 and probably not older than 98'-99'. It's an absurdist comedy with a team of girls who has pretty much useless powers. One of the powers is, how I remember it, Earth Falldown. She just falls over. 

They do battle against either monsters or aliens and one of the antagonists rise up from the ocean. I also remember wooden poles stuck in the sand at the beach when they do battle.

I'm turning 30 this year and when I was younger I watched a lot more animes than I do now. I liked “old” animes like OG Dragonball, Inuyasha, Cowboy Bebop, and Neon Genesis Evangelion. When I got together with my wife, I got her into anime and we watched Naruto, Sword Art Online and Attack on Titan together. Nowadays, she watches more anime than I do and everytime, she asks me to join her but I can't enjoy for some reason ""newer"" animes like Jujutsu Kaisen or Demon Slayer (her favourites). It feels like I have lost something on the way.. I don't know why but I think it's the newer artstyle of these animes. They look so clean and flawless in contrast to the ""good old, hand drawn"" animes. However, I wanna do my wife a favour and watch a show with her together. Which Animes would you recommend to a person like me? Is Jujutsu Kaisen worth it maybe? Or is there something I might enjoy more? Thank you all very kindly.

I watched this movie on Netflix in 2017, and haven’t been able to find it since.

This does spoil the ending.

It starts out at the base of a cliff like shore, with someone selling guns (maybe illegally). Then the main character somehow ends up on an island where he befriends a little girl, and he realizes something is wrong with how the island is ran. Something he finds weird is that there are no animal noises on the island, and no pets anywhere. He finds his way out to a forest on the island where there are living plants (they reminded me of mandrake roots from HP).

My journey in Anime so far,What to Watch?,"So far I have watched anime series like Demon Slayer, Romantic Killer, My happy marriage, Chainsaw Man, Naruto and movies Spirited Away, Howls moving castle, Arietty, Ponyo, basically all the Studio Ghibli ones.

I fell in love with Demon Slayer. The characters and the story line were very interesting. Each fight interesting techniques and each Demon backstop was very moving. The other series that I loved was Romantic Killer. I was hooked right from episode 1. Other than these 2 anime series, I couldn't find other series that are as interesting.

No offense to any fans, but Chainsaw Man was bad. There were no techniques or anything interesting in the fights. There was nothing particularly moving, and no character was worth remembering IMHO. I started Jujutsu Kaisen and I was basically forcing myself to get through till the 9th episode. Again, the fights weren't interesting, no scene in all the 9 episdes kept me to the edge of my seat.

Love is war is another anime that is supposed to be really great. But man, it was too cringe and bad that I couldn't make it past the 2nd episode.

Is it just me or are there others who also feel the same way? I really got into anime after Demon Slayer. I kept searching for other acclaimed anime to watch but I keep getting disappointed on watching them. 

So far the only anime I have LOVED is Demon slayer, Romantic killer. And all the Studio Ghibli movies <3

Unknown Title from 2021 which started mid to late year. Only watched episode 1 but it was listed to be a 12 episode season.,Help,"It started off in a peaceful village as a young boy and a chick were hanging out with town folks and bit of time went by until a villain came or arose and was trying to destroy the world. the boy saves the world or something and basically is extracted out of that world which is realised to be a book's world. So now in this book library or scripture hall that maintains the books.  
Don't recall if there were other fighters that were involved in jumping between these book worlds but the boy was sent to some ministers office to talk about this evil and is signed up or something to fight more of that evil in other books, i guess.   
Presuming the series continued after the first episode it'd have followed this storyline then? if there is anything i can elaborate more on from comments i will otherwise not sure what else to add for the moment",False,anime,1706717119.0,1afl9js

Anime recommendations for someone in need,What to Watch?,"Hi, I'm looking for a new anime to watch and I have this vibe I'm looking for but I have no idea what I'm looking for. I'm interested in watching an anime that's a little grungy, medium pace that has a bit of a plot to it and not very slice of life but a little soft like one but a little bit of something extra that happens in the universe. Maybe a little bit artsy in a way, more mature in nature but not a lot of fan service and not isekai. kinda thinking along the lines of something similar to Air gear, Bleach, Durarara!!, Blast of the tempest, Bungo Stray Dogs, Tokyo Goul, Blood Blockade, Noragami, The Unlimited Hyobu Kyosuke, Beelzebub and Gangsta. I have no idea if any of those anime fit into the vague vibe, I described or anything in common but I would appreciate it if anyone could help. Thank you",False,anime,1706716710.0,1afl3r6
Any one else notice this common issue with anime?,Discussion,"I started watching Inuyasha for the first time and was surprised how solid the world building was. After thinking about it it was less that inuyasha had a great setting and more that many anime tend to completely forget about the setting.

I don't know if some one else has a better name for this but i call it ""in a bottle syndrome"". Over time the story of many anime feel more and more like they are in a bottle and not at all part of a bigger setting.

Examples would include when the heros fight the villian for a long time and the rest of the world seems to dissappear until they are done, stories set in modern times where people forget police and hospitals exist until its dramatically convient, or most common of all when you get long running anime were there are almost no extras, as of the important characters all exist in a pocket dimension with other important characters and no one else.

I consider this a problem but its not a deal breaker, there are plenty of shows I have enjoyed that suffer from this. I just really appreciate when the setting is fully realized and reacts to the protagonists. It's a layer of depth that many of the all time great anime remember and many good anime do not.",False,anime,1706716609.0,1afl2f3

I don't like or watch anime but I am starting to find anime girls very attractive. is this weird/common? Am I turning into a neckbeard?,Help,"I am not into anime but my younger brother always watches it. I went to a anime convention with him last year on november. it was the anime con in NYC at javits center and it was his (and mine) first convention. I saw a lot of merchandise and stuff about half naked and lewd anime characters.

  
he downloaded and watches services like ""crunchyroll"" on his ps5 and when Im in the room as him I also end up hearing and watching the shows a bit.

I never really found cartoons that attractive, I watched things like animated superhero shows with characters like starfire and wonderwoman and I did think they hot but nothing like what I am feeling with anime?

Like the way these ""anime"" characters are drawn somehow entices me? Like their eyes and even hair?  
and its not just their appearance but its also their personalities and voices that somehow entices me?  
out of curiosity I started searching up ""ecchi"" and I found characters like ""rias gremory"" to really captivate me? like the way her body is shaped and detailed, her hair, her eyes, and the way she talks and act really entices me?

sorry about the long body text but I just feel kind of shocked and embarrassed about it. I never felt this way about other animated characters like ""jessica rabbit"" or daphne from scooby doo or any other ""hot"" animated character.  
theres something more charming and attractive about anime girls.  
Like am I turning to a neckbeard?

EDIT: also Why are anime girls so much hotter than other animated characters? Like I never felt this way towards ""jessica rabbit"" or any disney princesses or any video game characters like daisy and princess peach from mario.",False,anime,1706715528.0,1afknlh
Looking for suggestions of a deep/extensive storyline,What to Watch?,"I'm really craving a specific type of anime and struggling to scratch the itch.  Looking for something in the vein of FMA/brotherhood and 7 Samurai or Ghost in the shell.

Shonen or Seinen is cool so long as there is a complex storyline with pay off and a lot of purpose.  Character development is really important too. 

I'd like something dark and brooding but small comedy elements are welcome as long as they're minimal.  

Not to be too specific but either a realistic outdoor setting or a dystopian metropolis setting would be best.  More on the drama/horror/sci fi side than the fantasy side but I'm open to suggestions.  

Looking forward to hearing what you suggest.",False,anime,1706714499.0,1afk9kh

Desperately Looking for Anime Recommendations,What to Watch?,"Hey Anime Family! I was hoping some of you could help me out here, I'm a huge anime lover just like all of you, my tastes range from Isekai, Romantic Comedy, Slice Of Life, Heart Warming, Feel Good, Adventure, Reverse Isekai, Shonen, Harem, Parody and many others but I think those are the biggest for me. The thing is in my real life I suffer from chronic anxiety and depression and in that regard Anime is like a double edged sword to me. When I find a good anime that I enjoy it genuinely helps me, I'm the kind of person who feels everything our favorite protagonists feel when they feel it. 

Whether that be happiness, sadness, anger, world ending terror and everything in between, I'm going through it with them and I enjoy that while I'm watching it because it genuinely distracts me from how depressed I am in my own life I should add that I prefer to stay away from depressing themed animes that have too much suffering or sadness in them, I can deal with some, but for one instance, I'm torn on Re:Zero Starting Life In Another World. The reason why is because the characters, the story, the world building is AMAZING and its one of my favorite animes hands down. However, the depressing apsects if it are genuinely bad for my mental health, it makes me so unbelievably depressed that at times I wish I never got invested in it because now it's too late and I have to suffer as they suffer because I love them. 

Another thing I'd like to add is that it KILLS me when an anime I get into gets canceled or rather in the anime world the forever unknown because they never actually cancel it, we just never hear anything else about it andnwe go on forever hoping it'll get picked up for another season even though most likely it won't, apart from some rare cases like ""The Devil Is A Part Timer!"" Man I was so happy when that got a new 2 cour season even though it was soo many years later. When the anime is left unfinished it breaks my heart and it never leaves my mind which nowadays just seems like the norm unfortunately because as we all know Animes are just a way to get more people to buy the light novel and / or manga. 

So all of that being said (and I'm really sorry this post got away from me and got so long) I'm looking for recommendations for some great anime that are already completed (not canceled) and had a proper ending or its close to being completed (last season coming soon, or so insanely popular there's no way it won't air to completion). SOME of the many animes I've seen and loved (and yes I know some of these haven't finished airing and might not finish and it breaks me, sometimes when I run out of anime to watch I get anxious and have to pick one that's still ongoing, unfortunately for me)

If you guys can help me out with some recommendations based on this list and even if it's something different, if you think it's a good anime, and it has a proper conclusion, the anime finished without being canceled, please throw it my way! I really do appreciate your help everyone thank you so much and I realize this is a long post and goes into a few different issues I have personally so I would really appreciate it if nobody would pick on me for that. Thanks again everyone!

There was a TV series that I used to watch around 2000s, but I think it was probably older. The main character (if I'm correct that he was the main character) was a giant white robot, this robot fought villains like in many other series, but this one in particular had guns on it's elbows. 
That's the main thing I remember, this robot could turn it's arm up and bring some guns from it's elbows... Also I kinda remember it had only one red eye and one companion... But this part is kinda blurry.

Did I have a dream that I'm still confusing nowadays or is it real? 😂",False,anime,1706691422.0,1afdkse
The time has come,What to Watch?,"Hello keyboard warriors. Look at me, finished Attack on Titan .. damn, what a show. Now what should I watch?

Saying this, I would want some anime recommendations? i'd prefer even the old ones, maybe not so mainstream, no romantic drama and such, just plain good story and animation style. 

As ideas I would like to say what I've seen and I'm a fan of: Dragonball ofc, Yuyu Hakusho, One Piece, Attack on Titan, Bleach, Demon Slayer (first 2 seasons), Jujutsu Kaisen (just 1 season), Cowboy Bepop, Samurai Champloo, 7Samurai, Akira(movie ofc), Captain Tsubasa (thinking about trying Hajime No Ippo), Solo Leveling (new series) and things related to this genre or style and I think I've watched the OG anime shows.. (i know, i haven't watch full metal alchemist, i don't feel attracted enough to it so i could watch it). 

&#x200B;

Curious about what you recommend, what you like, what's the old anime that you'll always like? why not, movies included too.

I am looking for a cool anime that will have me thinking about it before going to bed every night :),What to Watch?,"I am not really a huge anime fan but when i watch them I usually enjoy them a lot (I rarely dislike them cuz I just stop watching if I dont like them.) I was hoping that you guys could give me some recommendations. I was hopping to find anime that are similar to Erased, Steins gate, Neon genesis, Cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, genocidal organ or aot. I really like the kind of anime that makes me think about it a lot. 

Thanks in advance! ",False,anime,1706690631.0,1afdeg6
Gundam Witch From Mercury S1 Episode 8 thoughts,Discussion,"Ik this aired like a year ago, but I was just watching it for the first time when I got this horrendous realization, and I needed to talk about it. Suletta isn't just a pseudonym for Eri so they could avoid the council. Suletta is a new daughter, or maybe a clone of some sort like Erlan was, and Eri was made into Ariel. It just makes too much sense. Eri was 4 years old in the prologue, and Suletta is 17 now, but they say the Vanadis incident was over 20 years ago. It makes no sense unless Suletta was born after Eri was. 

And look how hard Suletta & her mom are pushing the fact that Ariel is family to them. Suletta probably doesn't know it yet, but was taught to think of Ariel as a sister because the Mom wanted them to still have a connection. Also, think about what they said a Gundam was. It's the fusion between man and machine. What better way to fuse them than to literally combine them into one? That's why there's no burden on the pilot of Ariel when they do the Permet thing. The Gundam itself is taking on the burden so the pilot doesn't have to. And remember how Suletta's mom said that they definitely couldn't mass-produce Ariels? It's because it requires the sacrifice of someone with a very strong affinity for the Gundam.

Last and final point, look at the fucking names. Ariel? Eri? Coincidence? I think not.",False,anime,1706689645.0,1afd6e7
What are the best romantic anime of past years?,What to Watch?,"Hello

I've stopped animating since 2019, at the time the best ones were Spice & wolf, Clannad.. 

I really liked clannad that I rewatched recently and I still enjoy this mixed slice of life with a more serious side. More Adult 

I'm not looking for a clannad bis it doesn't exist, just a good romance that gives you the right emotions


My anime list when I was 17 years old (25 today :) 


https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Ayting&view=list&status=2

I really liked golden time, lovely complex, zero no tsukaima 

And I didn't like toradora because I had been advised to do it compared to 0 tuskaima except that the 2 protagonists turn around but  nothing happens until the last episode and I  Hated it 

So I've been wondering since 2018/2019 what has been released new that has been able to surpass everything I've seen 

Thank you in advance",False,anime,1706689095.0,1afd1qg

What's this art style from Tokari x One Piece crossover?,Help," So, I really like a specific art style/look but I'm not sure what's it called and what to look up for help drawing it. It's how they pan out on the shots of the castle from Disenchantment on Netflix and the look of the Thousand Sunny in Ep. 492 of One Piece in the Torika x One Piece crossover. Specifically, the look of it sailing away when then straw hats are leaving and after they say bye. ",False,anime,1706680697.0,1afatpb
