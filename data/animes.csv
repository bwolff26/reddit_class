Having trouble finding Anime to watch with my Gf who's new to anime,"I started her with Death Note cause she loves murder mystery and detective stuff, but I'm having some trouble finding out what else to introduce her to. She has physical tics, so she would prefer less intense Anime, but this isn't a deal breaker. A couple things she really doesn't enjoy are over the top gore and violence to animals. She also would rather watched dubbed cause she has trouble watching and reading and says the Japanese voices are hard to listen to (I think she's wrong on this part but can understand the reading and watching point. 
She is open to finding some romantic/love stories and obviously would enjoy some detective or murder mystery stuff. Thanks in advance for any recommendations!",False,manga,1705894161.0,19cm3ep,

My Thoughts on season 1 of hibike euphonium.,"These are my thoughts on season 1 without the OVA.

I cant tell if Kousaka and Kumiko are just becoming great friends or what tbh. Kousaka said she likes the teacher but when then they hangout they can get very intimate lol. The festival date or whatever that was felt like it was leading towards something. 

Whenever Kousaka is around it doesnt seem like normal friends hanging out lol. Im pretty sure one of them said i love you to each other but i could be misremembering. And u can love a friend.

I cant tell which way its going or if there is even gonna be romance lol. I dont want any spoilers about this but it would be cool to know if there is romance in the show at all in later seasons/movies?

The visuals of this show are amazing which is kinda what drew me in as well as season 3 being announced. Kyoto animation op. It had been on my list for a while but i decided to start it after asking about it and its great watching it on a large tv. I usually watch anime on my phone but this show seems so much better on a big screen.

I havent watched much music anime so i dont really have much to compare it to. Unless you count bocchi the rock i think this is the only music focused anime ive actually completed.

I dont really know much about band and have had no interest in it. I still dont have much interest in it but the show is good enough to make me want to keep watching.

Overall i think season 1 was very good and id give it an 8/10. I plan on continuing it tho i tend to not be in the mood for anime movies so not sure if ill be caught up before spring when season 3 comes. The opening and ending song are great as well.

Curious on how yall viewed season 1 compared to me as well? No spoilers pls tho beyond what i asked.",False,manga,1705892710.0,19clmrv,

How do I fill the void after Attack on Titan?,"I finally finished Attack on Titan, and I am in ruins! I hadn’t been that captivated by a show since I watched Death Note. The amount of expert foreshadowing, sheer attention to detail, the countless threads that masterfully all connect, the constant reinterpretation of old details, the compelling characters, plot line, world building, etc.

In my current state it’s hard for me to believe I’ll be able to quite match the immaculate storytelling of AoT, lol, but I am willing to give a shot to any shows you think are on the same caliber or (dare I say it) better?

Looking for a romance anime that doesn't immediately after the love interests finally get together,"So many romance animes spend the entire series with the two main love interests dancing around confessing to each other. Then they finally confess to each other at the end and get together and that's cool and all.

But I'm looking for a romance anime where they spend a significant amount of time dancing around confessing to each other, but it doesn't end immediately after the confession. Maybe like one or two seasons pre-confession but also has one or two additional seasons post-confession.

The closest example I can think of to this would be Kaguya-sama. Now, I know that's kind of a weird example because as of right now, [Kaguya-sama spoilers] >!the anime literally ends right exactly where Kaguya and Shirogane start dating, which is pretty much the opposite of what I'm looking for. But if you take into account the manga, them beginning to date is pretty much just the halfway point of the story. And I'm sure that the rest of the manga will be adapted eventually.!<

Nisekoi - Anime of the Week,"Welcome to the weekly Anime of the Week Discussion Thread! Each week, we're here to discuss various older anime series. Today we are discussing...

## Nisekoi

Raku Ichijou, a first-year student at Bonyari High School, is the sole heir to an intimidating yakuza family. Ten years ago, Raku made a promise to his childhood friend. Now, all he has to go on is a pendant with a lock, which can only be unlocked with the key which the girl took with her when they parted.

Now, years later, Raku has grown into a typical teenager, and all he wants is to remain as uninvolved in his yakuza background as possible while spending his school days alongside his middle school crush Kosaki Onodera. However, when the American Bee Hive Gang invades his family's turf, Raku's idyllic romantic dreams are sent for a toss as he is dragged into a frustrating conflict: Raku is to pretend that he is in a romantic relationship with Chitoge Kirisaki, the beautiful daughter of the Bee Hive's chief, so as to reduce the friction between the two groups. Unfortunately, reality could not be farther from this whopping lie—Raku and Chitoge fall in hate at first sight, as the girl is convinced he is a pathetic pushover, and in Raku's eyes, Chitoge is about as attractive as a savage gorilla.

Nisekoi follows the daily antics of this mismatched couple who have been forced to get along for the sake of maintaining the city's peace. With many more girls popping up his life, all involved with Raku's past somehow, his search for the girl who holds his heart and his promise leads him in more unexpected directions than he expects.

Shillbert had this to say on the tech literacy of modern kids
> Maybe it's the lack of proper technology education but most kids I've met these days are totally lost when it comes to computers.

> Lack of education and lack of experience. Back in the good old days, you had to learn how a computer worked to do anything fun (in the DOS days you'd have to configure HIMEM.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT, SoundBlaster, IRQs, etc just to play a game). Now you just tap an icon on your iPad and everything loads in from the Cloud.

* Have you ever used one of those finger swirl phones before? 
* Do you believe that the morbidly online Ojisan is any different from the three knights members we met? If there is a difference, please point it out. 
* This is probably a little late in the watch to ask, but now that you know Lain's definitely got different personalities, so you personally interpret Lain of the Bear Onesie and Lain of the Onee-chan different or is it just Bear Onesie Lain acting like a normie girl on purpose?

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!"" 

JustAnswerAQuestion scored a retroactive Abyssbringer prompt from a previous rewatch lol

> Is there a shared reality? Is your red the same as my red? Do you exist? Do I exist?

> Most people who are not philosophers would generally agree that there is a single reality that we all share. But for a few intermittent forays into hallucinogenic drug use, this has been true for all history. But if augmented-reality is universally deployed, that breaks down. The kids are worshiping a Lain-in-the-Sky that, at first, no-one else can perceive. With AR, nobody can be assured that another shares their perception. The common ground that underlies society collapses.

#[**Tomorrow's Prompt**](https://imgur.com/a/dUCpL5V)

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      

This ends up being a combo between Tarhanlindur, Vaadwaur and Esovan13 about the concept of ""walk in"" 
> You can download something into Mika's body, possibly even an earlier copy of Mika. A corpse is worm food, for good and ill.

> Note that this is not necessarily a good thing.  (You may already know this, IIRC Dion Fortune goes into this somewhere, but the concept is called a walk-in in occultism circles.  The lore is that sometimes this is another human soul, but unfortunately sometimes it can be something much more malevolent...)

>The walk in concept I’ll have a hard time forgetting as it ended up playing a critical role in The X-Files in what was and still is one of the worst resolutions to a storyline I have ever seen.

So far though it mostly seems like a gag comedy along the lines of helck or mashle(both of which I enjoyed more at this point).

What anime characters motivate you?,"Through out my time of watching anime I often find myself admiring certain characters.

I love that about anime, that they can have such depth to the characters and their development and can convey such emotion that I can empathize and admire them. Characters that come to mind when I think of this are Chise from The Ancient Magus Bride, her perseverance and her dedication to helping others no matter if it puts her in danger. MaoMao from Apothecary Dairies, her wit and hunger for knowledge. Rishe from 7th Time Loop. Sawako from Kimi Ni Todoke. Yuji Itadori from jjk. Tanjiro Kamado from Demon Slayer.

I stopped watching cause till then i was binging it and i didnt want to wait each week for an episode and decided to start again after the wano arc had ended. Now the arc has ended im thinking if i should start from the begining. But i just saw a reel of someone calculating the time actually needed to watch 1000 episodes and it hit me that maybe that many episodes is a bit long.  
So im here asking your opinion should i rewatch it/ continue from where ive stooped/ start from the begining of wano arc/ or just read the manga (also im  afraid that ill miss out on the ost, incredible voice acting and funny moments if i go manga)
And i do have some free time right now and ill probably skip forward some parts(not enire episode ) and fillers. Also the recaps op and ed. So that would shave of some time.",False,manga,1705864928.0,19cbad5,

"What Have You Watched This Past Week That is NOT a Currently Airing Show?

With regards to Fall 2023 shows, however, it would be fine to write about them as long as you only began them after they finished airing. For example, it's fine to talk about watching **The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You** or **Arknights: Perish in Frost** if you started them after the final episode aired. Obviously, use your best judgement on this.

5. Question more suited for [u/b0bba\_Fett](https://www.reddit.com/user/b0bba_Fett/) who said that Shinpachi character was underused during the Silver Soul arc. - Did Shinpachi being a last line of defense against Utsuro changed your opinion on him, or no?
6. **FOR FIRST TIMERS -** Utsuro was denied by everyone, he jumped in Altana and now there is 2 years timeskip. *IS THAT IT? WHAT ABOUT THE REMAINING 6 EPISODES, 2 OVAs, and Final Movie?* Well my question is, what’s your final prediction for the remaining 8 episodes (6+2) and Final Movie that will cover last 34 chapters?

Looking for Anime with good English dubs husband will watch...,"Ok, so I watch a lot of anime. I tend towards lighter, fluffier ones, (think *Recovery of an MMO Junkie* or *Spy Family*) but also some action-y ones--honestly, I watch just about anything though I'm not a super fan of stuff like *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure*. My son and I watch a lot together (My New Boss is Goofy, Wotakoi, Kakuriyo, Norigami, etc.). However, I usually only watch things that are subbed as most dubs just drive me nuts as the VAs in English never seem as good. I have never been able to get my husband to watch any as he hates to watch anything with subtitles (he won't touch a Kdrama with a barge pole).

WOW Dorohedoro is amazing.,"I decided to watch it a week ago and now I wonder why I didn't watch it before. 

The world of *Dorohedoro* is unlike any other I've seen before, the world has got sorcerers with the weirdest of magic I've seen and the creepiest of characters, I mean there are zombies in of of the episode and somehow it all makes sense. 

First time in a long time I didn't hate a single character form Caiman to En I liked every character, one of the character named Ebisu is an absolute crackhead throughout the season and I love it. You would think you've seen it all until you watch the next episode.

From the plot to the worldbuilding everything has been amazing and fun. Give it a go if you haven't till yet, more people need to talk about *Dorohedoro*

Season 2 has been announced, very excited to see more of it.",False,manga,1705845136.0,19c3uty,

What’s everyone’s top 5 anime? And why?,"Mine are for different reasons, but they all lead back to having a special place in my heart.


1 - Fairy Tail -
It holds a very special place in my heart for being the first bigger anime I ever watched. I love the over all story and being able to fallow the characters that I love dearly in their journey. Are some parts/story arcs better than others, most definitely so, but that doesn’t change my overall love for this anime.


2 - Dr. Stone -
This anime has a vicious grip on my emotional state some days. It makes me cry so easily, like listening to the op/end songs alone can make me ball my eyes out. There’s not a character I dislike in this entire anime, I absolutely love them all in their own different way! Do I have my favorites, of course I do, but every character is written so well in my opinion that I can’t dislike any of them. It’s other one of those anime where I love watching the characters journey into the new world. Bonus points for the amazing soundtrack!


3 - Maid-Sama! -
This one holds the number three spot mostly because it was my first ever anime and I have great memories of watching it as a kid, it holds a dear spot in my heart for that alone.


4 - Wolf Children - (yes a movie not a show).
This movie holds a place in my heart for how many different emotions it made me feel at such a young age, and still does to this day. It was also the first ever anime I watched with my mother, which is a very found memory for me.


5 - Yuri on Ice!!! -
The first ever lgbt related anime I watched. It can still make me cry to this day, especially the ending song. I remember this being an anime that when my dad found out what was in it he told me not to be watching it, but I watched it  anyway. I did however stop somewhere in the middle though and never actually finished it until about a year or so later (not because of my dad but because I got distracted with other stuff). Absolutely loved it in its entirety, and it was my I’m gonna watch it anyway show.


So there’s my top 5 and the reasons why! What’s yours?",False,manga,1705828318.0,19bzglc,

The dungeon really feels ALIVE, and rather than trying to go out of its way to explain it's mysteries to you through a whole introductory exposition dump, the show instead feeds you information about how its world operates through what's relevant in the storytelling. It's actually very captivating and has me looking forward to what they're going to cook up next.

Wonderful first three episodes. Give it a chance if you haven't already.",False,manga,1705805999.0,19btfb5,

Looking for something good in English dub,"So I’m no longer a newbie in the anime space after a little over a year watching but idk what my “taste” is yet. 

I’m looking for something “new to me”  so here are my top anime’s at the moment 

One piece 

Vinland saga (especially season 2) 

Black clover 

Theses are my top 3 at the moment I’ve recently watched jujitsu Kaiszen and mashvile mussels  and magic and demon slayer (and no I’m not looking up how there actually spelled) theses are ok solid 7’s in my book with the weakest link being  mashvile at around a 5.5 for me. 

I think I’m looking for something a bit more grounded like Vinland saga but my biggest thing are characters that have a bit more depth and character exploration like one piece and Vinland saga 

I’m thinking about watching Attack on titan but I watch anime at night while I’m going to sleep and think it might be a bit too intense. 

Any recommendations?",False,manga,1705802587.0,19bsbt6,

#2. Death Note ( the dark and sinister vibe with thrilling twists and mystery, the k*nky undertones) 

#3. Chainsaw Man ( The raunchy humor paired with solid storytelling and captivating action)

#4. Dragon Ball ( inappropriate and offensive humor, nostalgic classic, innocent) 

#5. The Promised Neverland ( creative and thrilling dark storyline, captivating) 

I didn't care for Attack On Titans or My Hero. Tower of God was okay. I watched all of Demon Slayer so far but who hasn't. I love Jujutsu Kaisen but haven't finished it because I save it for special circumstances/persons.

* Praise the Lain!! 
* If our rewatch group got together one day to say our prayers to the sky, what do you suppose would appear? 
* Would you have preferred Mika to die than be left in her current state? 
* Seeing how the Cunny Killer Doctor is living a fairly pleasant retirement, what are your thoughts on the idea of being linked to a dream machine during our end of life care? Is it too humane? Or perhaps too inhumane? I know it's a sore subject for some people so feel free to skip this if you're not comfortable discussing the topic. 
* We've finally been formally introduced to ""Lain of the Wired,"" say something nice about her~

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!""

> # TꟼMOЯꟼ

> Lain witnesses Mika fully losing her grip on reality here. I've speculated before that she has a similar disorder to Lain which is why she seems to be the most aware of Lain's hallucinations, and I think Lain's condition steadily deteriorating primed her for a complete breakdown with the right trigger- the weird message written on the cult napkins. That moment sent Mika into a mental spiral and she came out differently on the other side, leaving her sanity on the doorstep, as it were

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      

Unfortunately my own post was a bit too spoilery to put in the actual post body but we got many interesting interpretations, including this one from DegenerateRegime! 
> Here's one way of looking at it, though I don't consider it to be the truth: when she says to Lain ""I saw you earlier,"" Lain has no memory of this - she was fully spaced out at the time and only remembers being on the Wired all day. So, she imagines a whole narrative where she manifested on a screen, somehow, that would explain Mika's *meaningful* comment. In this narrative, Mika behaves like Lain imagines she would, ie more like Lain herself does (Lain's theory of mind may not be in the best shape). When the narrative collides with reality, Lain sees a hallucinatory image trying to continue it briefly before fading. The issue with such ""explanations"" is that they're too powerful; *anything* can be explained by them, making them uninteresting (cf ""it was all a dream"").

I can kind of understand why Makoto Shinkai sticks to his formula due to Lost Voices,"I mean I’ve seen most of his films aside from the new one, but lately I was looking back at his movies as they look really beautiful first off, and secondly while I understand why some of his fans say that he uses a specific formula too much (I.e. boy and girl romance) I can understand why he does it.



Like I can recall like it was yesterday when I sat down to watch the movie Children Who Chase Lost Voices around 10 years ago, and while it was a very beautiful movie in its art, it kind of felt like it was trying too hard to go for Studio Ghibli vibes as I don’t know how to explain it, but the movie had felt like it was trying a bit too hard to be like a Hayao Miyazaki movie in some way, so my point being is while I did like how Shinkai made an attempt to break away from his typical romantic formula he had been known for doing at the time, it seems that the results didn’t go so well for some reason.",False,manga,1705775922.0,19bii9x,

Waifu/Husbando Culture is Suffocating Good Character Writing.,"I think *Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury* may be one of my favorite new shows of the last couple years. This has only been more true since starting to really deep dive into the Gundam franchise over the last month or so (having previously only seen the original Tomino saga and the Origin OVA). While G-Witch isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination (it lays the trademark Gundam campiness on a little too thick in it first half or so of S1 and takes a while to find its own identity), it has a lot of fun moving the Gundam formula away from a ""war bad"" political drama into one more centered on corporate politics and has what I think to be two of the best leads in this franchise to date. Suletta and Miorine's development across the series (both in terms of their relationship and in terms of them as individuals) is honestly some of the best I've seen over these last couple years, and the ways this series isn't willing to pull any punches makes it hit so much better. The fact we were even able to get a full story within only 2 cours in the modern anime climate says enough, and I really can't recommend the series enough.

With all this being said, I have felt extremely let down by the discourse I've seen surrounding this show since 99% of it is only concerned with one thing: lesbians. Even back in Fall 2022, all I ever heard was that it was ""The Gundam show with the lesbian MCs"" and that continued into the new year with the media circus around Bandai Namco's downplaying of their relationship in press interviews. Even a lot of the more negative reviews of the show that I've seen center around it being ""clear Yuri bait"". At the CRAs (insert obligatory ""CRAs are normie trash"" comment here) G-Witch was only nominated for Best Original Anime (a category so barren that *The Marginal Service* was nominated) and the Anya Forger Award (which is barely worth a mention for reasons I don't want to get into here) and the r/anime awards were slightly better, but I still feel the fact the show never escaped the moniker of being ""The Gundam show with the lesbian MCs"" held it back from reaching a larger audience (especially considering the steep hurdle that is being a mecha show in current day). 

To boil down Suletta and Miorine to just being ""the Gundam lesbians"" and G-Witch to just being ""the Gundam show with the lesbians MCs"" just feels like a massive disservice to the show at large and especially to the two leads who felt more fleshed out than 90% of anime MCs these days. And while I've been bitching about Gundam for most of this post, I feel like it isn't an isolated issue. I'll be burned at the stake if I bring up a certain portion of the anime fandoms obsession with gay and lesbian ships whether canon or not (see JJK and the Bocchi fandom for some of the worst offenders) but even that isn't going far enough.

I feel like on a general level, our obsession with shipping and waifus/husbandos has not only kept discourse around good character writing but has started to recirculate back to the point where it has affected the quality of characters being output. Anime girls in particular feel ever more sanded down to always be marketable and safe while anime boys (if JJK is any indicator) aren't too far behind. It's no secret at this point that Gege really didn't like writing for Gojo, but when you consider just how static his archetype is can you really blame him? We have sanded anime characters down to the point where they've lost the parts of their personality that make for compelling characters and so long as we continue to sand their edges the final output will only continue to decline in quality.

I said a couple months back how the communities aversion to flawed characters is hurting this medium and I don't think that point has changed. However, diving into the discourse around G-Witch and seeing Eren yet again nominated for Best Main Character (an answer to which I've often heard as ""yeah but he's hot"") makes me think that this problem is only getting worse. I know this medium is capable of creating some really strong and dynamic characters, but we don't get there if the only names that bubble to the top do so because of who they sleep with, who we want them to sleep with, or because we want to sleep with them.

But I guess what do y'all think? How do you think the quality of character writing in anime has changed over time? Do you think our obsession with waifus and husbandos are making things better or worse? Did you watch G-Witch? Did you like G-Witch? Am I just out of touch?

How do you feel about more anime being made to appeal to a Western audience?,"Netflix is known for this with titles like B: The Beginning, Devilman Crybaby, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, and Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. Toonami will be airing Ninja Kamui next month, which clearly has a Western audience in mind.

I find it interesting that being set in a Western country or having Western characters doesn't necessarily make an anime feel like it's made for Westerners. Anime have been set in Germany, France, England, the USA, and European-style fantasy worlds for decades— but at least to me, those older titles don't have the ""made for Westerners"" vibe I get from anime like Ninja Kamui.

Is anyone else able to feel this vibe? I can't put my finger on it, but I can sense something is different. If you are a Westerner, do you like the for-Westerners style?",False,manga,1705769188.0,19bfxfh,

Paranoia Agent 20th Anniversary Rewatch two week reminder,"Hey, guys. Holofan4life here. 

I am pleased to announce that I will be hosting the 20th anniversary rewatch of Paranoia Agent

##What is Paranoia Agent about?

The infamous Shounen Bat is terrorizing the residents of Musashino City. Flying around on his rollerblades and beating people down with a golden baseball bat, the assailant seems impossible to catch—much less understand. His first victim, the well-known yet timid character designer Tsukiko Sagi, is suspected of orchestrating the attacks. Believed only by her anthropomorphic pink stuffed animal, Maromi, Tsukiko is just one of Shounen Bat's many victims.

As Shounen Bat continues his relentless assault on the town, detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa begin to investigate the identity of the attacker. However, more and more people fall victim to the notorious golden bat, and news of the assailant begins circulating around the town. Paranoia starts to set in as chilling rumors spread amongst adults and children alike.

Will the two detectives be able to unravel the truth behind Shounen Bat, or will the paranoia get to them first?

##Why should I watch Paranoia Agent?

Paranoia Agent is the brainchild of Satoshi Kon. He is the director of acclaimed films such as Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, and Tokyo Godfathers. This is his one and only TV show he was the creator and director for. I've really been getting into his work as of late, and I really want to check out the TV show he created. And what better timing given it's the 20 year anniversary than to watch it with you guys?

Urban-fantasy with lots of action,"Hey! Nowadays I’ve been more into this style of anime where it’s based on reality but with some twists of fantasy (Urban Fantasy) and especially with lots of action.

Elfen Lied
Killing Bites
Inuyashiki
Death Note
Munou na Nana
My Home hero (not a lot of fantasy)
Platinum End

If you’re going to have 25 different awards then have more than the same 5/8 different anime for every one! It’s ridiculous. It makes it boring to vote and boring to hear the results.

Each category should have different titles (with a few repeats). The fact that Best Cinematography or Best Art Direction didn’t have The Ancient Magus Bride as an option blows my mind.

I just can't find the name of this anime I watched,"I watched this anime super long ago, maybe 2-3 years ago, and I can't remember it's name. From what I remember the the protagonist was some woman and she was getting stalked by some super ugly guy. Throughout the anime he keeps getting bolder. She also has a guy friend who she has confided in about it. The rising point is when the ugly man sneaks into her room when she is not home and when she does get home and checks her cameras, she sees him crawl under her bed and never leave. He crawls out from under the bed and I think he starts chasing her. That part is kinda blank for me. I know the plot twist is that the guy friend she trusted and confided in was planning to kill her and the ugly guy was trying to warn her all along. I believe the end to the anime was her and the guy tied up or something in a shed with the guy friend. He sets the place on fire and leaves them to die but the ugly guy fights back but gets killed with an axe. I know there is also a recognizable scene where the girl receives a box of butchered human remains and when she calls the police it was actually just kimchi and she was seeing things. It gives a psychological horror feel. I just can't quite put my finger on it and it's been eating at me. Please help. No it's not Perfect Blue people have said that it isn't.

Rising of the shield hero big question (possible spoilers in answers given),Ok so I just finished season 3 of ROTSH.  Significantly better than season 2 in my opinion.  But all that aside I am seriously wondering what is going on with Alta and Aultcray.  Keep in mind I want limited info if possible.  I am usually really good about not spoiling things for myself but I hella expected this so be resolved so now I just want to know why he is constantly lurking like a predator around her.  He even asked if she had enough to eat.  The fact that aultcray is only ever watching her and only worried if she was hungry leads me to believe it has nothing to do with Alta specifically… like she is his long lost family or something.  Since Fohls is her older brother and he could t really care less I feel it might have something to do with her eyes.  Maybe it’s a certain gift someone is born with… and maybe he knew someone with it… or maybe even those eyes belong to a certain someone that I guess is continuously reborn and now it’s Alta…. I guess he could have sired her and only her and Fohls mom cheated on his dad and got pregnant.  Or maybe Fohls dad died…. I don’t know…. It’s really bugging me hard… it’s all I care about right now.  Someone that reads the manga please just tell me what the hell it is that so important about Alta to him.,False,manga,1705737544.0,19b6r4d,

Just finished Kill La Kill. My thoughts.,"Spoilers below. 
.
.
.
.
.

Was recommended Kill La Kill by a friend and I just binged what was basically the entire thing. Started episode one a day and a half ago and finished the last 19 episodes all at once tonight(+ the OVA/“ending”, which I almost missed).

Yeah, I’m wiped. 

But it was still good though! My LORD the last couple of episodes had some crazy twists and turns. The biggest one (for me was) near the end when you think “damn, they killed their newborn daughter and Satuskis sister” and it’s like NAH Ryuuko is the kid. Crazy dude. That’s something I did NOT expect. Same with the Satsuki twist where she reveals her true intentions and tries to kill her mother.

My biggest praise for the show?

The villains were top tier. Satsuki and the Elite Four were great as starter “decoy” villains. Then Nui stole the show from them (quite literally). Nui was an AMAZING villain in the idea that she was basically unkillable throughout the entire show and was EXTREMELY hateable based upon how cocky she was. When she pulled out the other half of the Scissor-Blade for the first time my jaw dropped. Ragyo (the mother) wasn’t half-bad either, but I feel like they pushed more of the “she’s invincible” aspect onto her than they actually explained her backstory (or maybe they did explain her backstory? it’s been a long night).

Another good thing about the show was the musical score (no, NOT the band lady’s, though she was great in every scene she was in).  Each “theme” (the Ryuuko non-lyrical theme, the Goku uniform power-up theme, the Satuski theme, etc.) was good. As for the lyrical themes they frequently put in (the Ryuuko “don’t lose your way” (I think those were the lyrics?) theme and the Kiryuin family theme), I think they were fantastic choices. Each got the point across that they were extremely powerful beings. 

Not a lot of criticism to be had but I got WAY too much of a feeling, more than I feel they needed, they were trying to appeal to teenage Western boys.

I also felt that they could’ve gone up a notch with the Goku uniforms near the middle (4/5 Star) but chose not to. There were times I got the feeling “ok, this is it, a 4-star uniform is coming!” and it didn’t. 

Biggest questions?

Probably the biggest one I have is if Ryuuko is a confirmed lesbian (through whatever source I might’ve missed) or if it’s simply “implied” through the “re-awakened” kiss with Nui and the date with Mako. Not that it matters like crazy but I AM still curious as both those things were sudden. 

Anyway yeah, that about wraps it up. Overall rating is a solid 9/10. Good anime.

Thanks for reading! Hope you enjoyed the show as much as I did if you watched!",False,manga,1705734198.0,19b5wzg,

Imagine Eva Wei being 100% Orphan,"Eva Wei still had Don Wei as her father, but the connection was shattered even before the series began. Don became a heartless man with no connection to Eva who became “Molly”. She was trying to win the “Ultimate Prize” to bring her mother Mya back and erase the pain, but there was no prize she desperately wanted, and she felt crushed. Though things work out in the end, but imagine if she completely lost her entire family Canaletto or not.

When Mya was killed in the crash, Don became a broken man and sent Eva away in a boarding school for the next 10 years. Instead of Don meeting Rick Thunderbolt to rebuild his life, Don who couldn’t go on without his wife, gets weaker and weaker after abandoning his daughter until he eventually died of grieve and broken heart. With no sign of her father’s presence anywhere, Eva grew more and more bitter to the point of only knowing pain, sadness, anger, and hatred because of the strict environment of her school and no family seeing her to seeing the dark side of the Great Race of Oban.

Eva could’ve been more like tragic characters from different shows like Scar from Fullmetal Alchemist, Shinn Asuka from Gundam SEED Destiny, and Kuvira from Avatar: The Legend of Korra. She might involve wanting to destroy everything that caused her pain or torture those to experience her pain or going to extremes to make sure she was never vulnerable even if it will cause harm to others. More likely she would be completely vulnerable to Canaletto to the point of possibly succeeding in his goals. Making her the “Ultimate Creation” of Canaletto.",False,manga,1705727256.0,19b40mx,
Help identifying an anime from years ago.,"Anime identification?

I watched this anime years ago on YouTube. All I remember is:
- the main character is learning to make video games
- he (mc) lives in a house with other students
- they at one point in the season all have to move out because it's condemned?
- one guy in the house successfully makes video games
- one girl wants to be a voice actor but has been trying for three years and is on her last shot?
- they have an assembly at their school where they stage a mech video game. VA girl is the main character
- the school all has to tell their feelings to help the mech win?
- I think the guy gets the crowd to yell by confessing his feelings

I can kind of understand why Makoto Shinkai sticks to his formula due to Lost Voices,"I mean I’ve seen most of his films aside from the new one, but lately I was looking back at his movies as they look really beautiful first off, and secondly while I understand why some of his fans say that he uses a specific formula too much (I.e. boy and girl romance) I can understand why he does it.



Like I can recall like it was yesterday when I sat down to watch the movie Children Who Chase Lost Voices around 10 years ago, and while it was a very beautiful movie in its art, it kind of felt like it was trying too hard to go for Studio Ghibli vibes as I don’t know how to explain it, but the movie had felt like it was trying a bit too hard to be like a Hayao Miyazaki movie in some way, so my point being is while I did like how Shinkai made an attempt to break away from his typical romantic formula he had been known for doing at the time, it seems that the results didn’t go so well for some reason.",False,manga,1705775922.0,19bii9x,

Waifu/Husbando Culture is Suffocating Good Character Writing.,"I think *Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury* may be one of my favorite new shows of the last couple years. This has only been more true since starting to really deep dive into the Gundam franchise over the last month or so (having previously only seen the original Tomino saga and the Origin OVA). While G-Witch isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination (it lays the trademark Gundam campiness on a little too thick in it first half or so of S1 and takes a while to find its own identity), it has a lot of fun moving the Gundam formula away from a ""war bad"" political drama into one more centered on corporate politics and has what I think to be two of the best leads in this franchise to date. Suletta and Miorine's development across the series (both in terms of their relationship and in terms of them as individuals) is honestly some of the best I've seen over these last couple years, and the ways this series isn't willing to pull any punches makes it hit so much better. The fact we were even able to get a full story within only 2 cours in the modern anime climate says enough, and I really can't recommend the series enough.

With all this being said, I have felt extremely let down by the discourse I've seen surrounding this show since 99% of it is only concerned with one thing: lesbians. Even back in Fall 2022, all I ever heard was that it was ""The Gundam show with the lesbian MCs"" and that continued into the new year with the media circus around Bandai Namco's downplaying of their relationship in press interviews. Even a lot of the more negative reviews of the show that I've seen center around it being ""clear Yuri bait"". At the CRAs (insert obligatory ""CRAs are normie trash"" comment here) G-Witch was only nominated for Best Original Anime (a category so barren that *The Marginal Service* was nominated) and the Anya Forger Award (which is barely worth a mention for reasons I don't want to get into here) and the r/anime awards were slightly better, but I still feel the fact the show never escaped the moniker of being ""The Gundam show with the lesbian MCs"" held it back from reaching a larger audience (especially considering the steep hurdle that is being a mecha show in current day). 

To boil down Suletta and Miorine to just being ""the Gundam lesbians"" and G-Witch to just being ""the Gundam show with the lesbians MCs"" just feels like a massive disservice to the show at large and especially to the two leads who felt more fleshed out than 90% of anime MCs these days. And while I've been bitching about Gundam for most of this post, I feel like it isn't an isolated issue. I'll be burned at the stake if I bring up a certain portion of the anime fandoms obsession with gay and lesbian ships whether canon or not (see JJK and the Bocchi fandom for some of the worst offenders) but even that isn't going far enough.

I feel like on a general level, our obsession with shipping and waifus/husbandos has not only kept discourse around good character writing but has started to recirculate back to the point where it has affected the quality of characters being output. Anime girls in particular feel ever more sanded down to always be marketable and safe while anime boys (if JJK is any indicator) aren't too far behind. It's no secret at this point that Gege really didn't like writing for Gojo, but when you consider just how static his archetype is can you really blame him? We have sanded anime characters down to the point where they've lost the parts of their personality that make for compelling characters and so long as we continue to sand their edges the final output will only continue to decline in quality.

I said a couple months back how the communities aversion to flawed characters is hurting this medium and I don't think that point has changed. However, diving into the discourse around G-Witch and seeing Eren yet again nominated for Best Main Character (an answer to which I've often heard as ""yeah but he's hot"") makes me think that this problem is only getting worse. I know this medium is capable of creating some really strong and dynamic characters, but we don't get there if the only names that bubble to the top do so because of who they sleep with, who we want them to sleep with, or because we want to sleep with them.

But I guess what do y'all think? How do you think the quality of character writing in anime has changed over time? Do you think our obsession with waifus and husbandos are making things better or worse? Did you watch G-Witch? Did you like G-Witch? Am I just out of touch?

How do you feel about more anime being made to appeal to a Western audience?,"Netflix is known for this with titles like B: The Beginning, Devilman Crybaby, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, and Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. Toonami will be airing Ninja Kamui next month, which clearly has a Western audience in mind.

I find it interesting that being set in a Western country or having Western characters doesn't necessarily make an anime feel like it's made for Westerners. Anime have been set in Germany, France, England, the USA, and European-style fantasy worlds for decades— but at least to me, those older titles don't have the ""made for Westerners"" vibe I get from anime like Ninja Kamui.

Is anyone else able to feel this vibe? I can't put my finger on it, but I can sense something is different. If you are a Westerner, do you like the for-Westerners style?",False,manga,1705769188.0,19bfxfh,

Paranoia Agent 20th Anniversary Rewatch two week reminder,"Hey, guys. Holofan4life here. 

I am pleased to announce that I will be hosting the 20th anniversary rewatch of Paranoia Agent

##What is Paranoia Agent about?

The infamous Shounen Bat is terrorizing the residents of Musashino City. Flying around on his rollerblades and beating people down with a golden baseball bat, the assailant seems impossible to catch—much less understand. His first victim, the well-known yet timid character designer Tsukiko Sagi, is suspected of orchestrating the attacks. Believed only by her anthropomorphic pink stuffed animal, Maromi, Tsukiko is just one of Shounen Bat's many victims.

As Shounen Bat continues his relentless assault on the town, detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa begin to investigate the identity of the attacker. However, more and more people fall victim to the notorious golden bat, and news of the assailant begins circulating around the town. Paranoia starts to set in as chilling rumors spread amongst adults and children alike.

Will the two detectives be able to unravel the truth behind Shounen Bat, or will the paranoia get to them first?

##Why should I watch Paranoia Agent?

Paranoia Agent is the brainchild of Satoshi Kon. He is the director of acclaimed films such as Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, and Tokyo Godfathers. This is his one and only TV show he was the creator and director for. I've really been getting into his work as of late, and I really want to check out the TV show he created. And what better timing given it's the 20 year anniversary than to watch it with you guys?

Urban-fantasy with lots of action,"Hey! Nowadays I’ve been more into this style of anime where it’s based on reality but with some twists of fantasy (Urban Fantasy) and especially with lots of action.

Examples of animes I’ve watched:
Black Lagoon (probably the most realistic)
Parasyte
Erased
Elfen Lied
Killing Bites
Inuyashiki
Death Note
Munou na Nana
My Home hero (not a lot of fantasy)
Platinum End 
Rainbow

Some of them are more realistic and others have more fantasy, I also like the fights, I’m ok with “powers” but I want more action then talking

Crunchyroll awards and their same five picks for every award.,"Does anyone else get frustrated by the fact that every year Crunchyroll has the same 7 anime for every single selection of awards for their yearly award. I get that the ones they list are the most popular of the year, but they’re not the only popular ones from the past year. It’s frustrating to me when there’s sooooo many different anime that have come out that should get a chance to be voted on, a chance to be appreciated. If you’re going to have 25 different awards then have more than the same 5/8 different anime for every one! It’s ridiculous. It makes it boring to vote and boring to hear the results. Like oh wow how fun and rewarding that jjk or aot has won five different awards. It’s not like 100+ new anime didn’t come out this past year. Each category should have different titles (with a few repeats). The fact that Best Cinematography or Best Art Direction didn’t have The Ancient Magus Bride as an option blows my mind. That’s just one example of how they steal the award from an anime that might be more deserving.

I just can't find the name of this anime I watched,"I watched this anime super long ago, maybe 2-3 years ago, and I can't remember it's name. From what I remember the the protagonist was some woman and she was getting stalked by some super ugly guy. Throughout the anime he keeps getting bolder. She also has a guy friend who she has confided in about it. The rising point is when the ugly man sneaks into her room when she is not home and when she does get home and checks her cameras, she sees him crawl under her bed and never leave. He crawls out from under the bed and I think he starts chasing her. That part is kinda blank for me. I know the plot twist is that the guy friend she trusted and confided in was planning to kill her and the ugly guy was trying to warn her all along. I believe the end to the anime was her and the guy tied up or something in a shed with the guy friend. He sets the place on fire and leaves them to die but the ugly guy fights back but gets killed with an axe. I know there is also a recognizable scene where the girl receives a box of butchered human remains and when she calls the police it was actually just kimchi and she was seeing things. It gives a psychological horror feel. I just can't quite put my finger on it and it's been eating at me. Please help. No it's not Perfect Blue people have said that it isn't.

Rising of the shield hero big question (possible spoilers in answers given),Ok so I just finished season 3 of ROTSH.  Significantly better than season 2 in my opinion.  But all that aside I am seriously wondering what is going on with Alta and Aultcray.  Keep in mind I want limited info if possible.  I am usually really good about not spoiling things for myself but I hella expected this so be resolved so now I just want to know why he is constantly lurking like a predator around her.  He even asked if she had enough to eat.  The fact that aultcray is only ever watching her and only worried if she was hungry leads me to believe it has nothing to do with Alta specifically… like she is his long lost family or something.  Since Fohls is her older brother and he could t really care less I feel it might have something to do with her eyes.  Maybe it’s a certain gift someone is born with… and maybe he knew someone with it… or maybe even those eyes belong to a certain someone that I guess is continuously reborn and now it’s Alta…. I guess he could have sired her and only her and Fohls mom cheated on his dad and got pregnant.  Or maybe Fohls dad died…. I don’t know…. It’s really bugging me hard… it’s all I care about right now.

Just finished Kill La Kill. My thoughts.,"Spoilers below. 
.
.
.
.
.

Was recommended Kill La Kill by a friend and I just binged what was basically the entire thing. Started episode one a day and a half ago and finished the last 19 episodes all at once tonight(+ the OVA/“ending”, which I almost missed).

Yeah, I’m wiped. 

But it was still good though! My LORD the last couple of episodes had some crazy twists and turns. The biggest one (for me was) near the end when you think “damn, they killed their newborn daughter and Satuskis sister” and it’s like NAH Ryuuko is the kid. Crazy dude. That’s something I did NOT expect. Same with the Satsuki twist where she reveals her true intentions and tries to kill her mother.

My biggest praise for the show?

The villains were top tier. Satsuki and the Elite Four were great as starter “decoy” villains. Then Nui stole the show from them (quite literally). Nui was an AMAZING villain in the idea that she was basically unkillable throughout the entire show and was EXTREMELY hateable based upon how cocky she was. When she pulled out the other half of the Scissor-Blade for the first time my jaw dropped. Ragyo (the mother) wasn’t half-bad either, but I feel like they pushed more of the “she’s invincible” aspect onto her than they actually explained her backstory (or maybe they did explain her backstory? it’s been a long night).

Another good thing about the show was the musical score (no, NOT the band lady’s, though she was great in every scene she was in).  Each “theme” (the Ryuuko non-lyrical theme, the Goku uniform power-up theme, the Satuski theme, etc.) was good. As for the lyrical themes they frequently put in (the Ryuuko “don’t lose your way” (I think those were the lyrics?) theme and the Kiryuin family theme), I think they were fantastic choices. Each got the point across that they were extremely powerful beings. 

Not a lot of criticism to be had but I got WAY too much of a feeling, more than I feel they needed, they were trying to appeal to teenage Western boys.

I also felt that they could’ve gone up a notch with the Goku uniforms near the middle (4/5 Star) but chose not to. There were times I got the feeling “ok, this is it, a 4-star uniform is coming!” and it didn’t. 

Biggest questions?

Probably the biggest one I have is if Ryuuko is a confirmed lesbian (through whatever source I might’ve missed) or if it’s simply “implied” through the “re-awakened” kiss with Nui and the date with Mako. Not that it matters like crazy but I AM still curious as both those things were sudden. 

Anyway yeah, that about wraps it up. Overall rating is a solid 9/10. Good anime.

Thanks for reading! Hope you enjoyed the show as much as I did if you watched!",False,manga,1705734198.0,19b5wzg,

Imagine Eva Wei being 100% Orphan,"Eva Wei still had Don Wei as her father, but the connection was shattered even before the series began. Don became a heartless man with no connection to Eva who became “Molly”. She was trying to win the “Ultimate Prize” to bring her mother Mya back and erase the pain, but there was no prize she desperately wanted, and she felt crushed. Though things work out in the end, but imagine if she completely lost her entire family Canaletto or not.

When Mya was killed in the crash, Don became a broken man and sent Eva away in a boarding school for the next 10 years. Instead of Don meeting Rick Thunderbolt to rebuild his life, Don who couldn’t go on without his wife, gets weaker and weaker after abandoning his daughter until he eventually died of grieve and broken heart. With no sign of her father’s presence anywhere, Eva grew more and more bitter to the point of only knowing pain, sadness, anger, and hatred because of the strict environment of her school and no family seeing her to seeing the dark side of the Great Race of Oban.

Eva could’ve been more like tragic characters from different shows like Scar from Fullmetal Alchemist, Shinn Asuka from Gundam SEED Destiny, and Kuvira from Avatar: The Legend of Korra. She might involve wanting to destroy everything that caused her pain or torture those to experience her pain or going to extremes to make sure she was never vulnerable even if it will cause harm to others. More likely she would be completely vulnerable to Canaletto to the point of possibly succeeding in his goals. Making her the “Ultimate Creation” of Canaletto.",False,manga,1705727256.0,19b40mx,
Help identifying an anime from years ago.,"Anime identification?

I watched this anime years ago on YouTube. All I remember is:
- the main character is learning to make video games
- he (mc) lives in a house with other students
- they at one point in the season all have to move out because it's condemned?
- one guy in the house successfully makes video games
- one girl wants to be a voice actor but has been trying for three years and is on her last shot?
- they have an assembly at their school where they stage a mech video game. VA girl is the main character
- the school all has to tell their feelings to help the mech win?
- I think the guy gets the crowd to yell by confessing his feelings


I've tried searching so hard, if anyone knows please help. Thank you so much for your time!",False,manga,1705727080.0,19b3yty,

A good mecha show to get into mechas?,"I've only watched two (1.5?) mechas so far. I watched Evangelion all the way through and absolutely ADORED it! Seriously. I know this is the most 'evangelion fan ever', but I genuinely think it's a masterpiece. Very flawed, but certainly an amazing work. Honestly, I definitely enjoyed it more for it's story aspect rather than the specifically 'mecha' one.

I guess that's one qualm I have with trying to pick a new mecha. I don't care that much about giant robot fights. I think they're really cool! But I get bored of them fast.

For me, when i was kid i love the animals from Pokemon and Digimon so much, so i always searching for anime with the MC is animals because i want to see him in every episode until i found a white wolf and the black hair guy picture on google i try to find some of the video about this  but my internet is very slow. Do you think i can watch the video with 2kb -3kb speed per seconds?


I waiting and waiting for long time and i finally can watch it! It is a video about fighting between black and white wolf and it have a lot of bloodshed the screen after that made me feel amazing about this anime


""Oh my god! I never thought to see something like that in the anime before!""


What i watch is a last episode of the anime name ""Wolf's rain"". When my internet speed is improved i can finally watch a whole episodes of this anime and it is a first time i watch the anime in japanese dub it feel like i hear conversation from aliens 😅. Moreover i just relize that i watched the last 4 episodes before a first episode it feel a little bit confused.

Need help finding an anime off memory,"So off memory about a decade or so ago, when I was a kid just finding out what anime is - I stumbled upon a scene (perhaps a final ending scene?) where a group of characters, mostly male, get trapped or something, in a dark cave/room, and they couldn't breath wether from a lack of oxygen or poisonous gas (or they were just critically weak in general)  and they seem to accept their impending doom lying down next to eachother and making jokes with one and another in their last moments together.

And a character, presumably the main character dies first just as they get a sign of a rescue, without the other characters knowing he had passed already, and when they call out his name, they tragically realise they were too late, and it's nothing but silence.

This scene has stuck with me for a long time as one of the first examples of how animation can have sad and tragic endings (assuming this was the final ep of this anime considering I remember it being so), and yet I can't find it for the life of me, and I don't even know if it exist.

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
Esovan13 has my favourite reaction to our boy Tarhanlindur's great wall of spoilers~ Still consistently some of the best content I've read tho to give credit. 
>[Reading your comments](https://files.catbox.moe/a41di6.png) 


And the people hated Vaadwaur, for he spoke the truth
>Psst...[The cruel truth]>!Gamer girls are either OF traps or E-girls with an angle!<

Specs64z had some pretty awesome analysis! 

> ""Humans are all alone. They’re not connected to anyone at all."" 

> A direct contradiction to Lain’s words from Layer 02, and a really bizarre line to start off with given where the episode goes. I believe it’s Chisa’s voice? Not sure.

> Lain spends her free time these days half naked and hunched over user manuals to build a state of the art computer. Her father spies on her, seemingly aware of something we are not. This newfound hobby imbues Lain with self confidence, and she seems to be able to talk with the girls in her class more readily.

Quiddy is anti Lain of the Bear Onesie, get him!! 
> Overall the best episode yet, I feel that now that we've set the groundwork over the first few episodes things really start kicking into gear and we have a long run of really strong, albeit really bizarre episodes coming. Lain's a bit more out of her shell and assertive now (perhaps symbolized by the fact that she's left behind her iconic bear PJs) which I like to see.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!"" 

Icesmiley score a W! 
> It appears that the first man who killed himself is confusing a little girl with a monster of some sort, the Cyberia DJ is having auditory hallucinations and the man with the cat shirt is perceiving everything as it would look in a Doom/Wolfenstein first person shooter type game with the pixelated stone walls and narrow tunnels in games of that time.  We don't see anything within their world connecting to their brains; this would indicate they are living in a virtual one that can be hacked from the inside.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      

It still counts as lore if its about video games? Right, hirmuolio? 
> The game shown is commonly compared to something like Doom or Wolfestein. But I think the game visuals are most likely inspired by Daggerfall which came out two years before the anime.

> The endless labyrinthian corridors are something every Daggerfall player will learn to ~~cope~~ love. And the bit with falling down the hole is very similar to holes in Daggerfall.

"What are some anime that people may or may not know about, that were incredibly popular in your country?","This question is probably geared towards someone in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s...

I'm from S. Korea, and from my understanding,

Because Japan was economically massive in 80s (the bubble era) lots of countries could not afford to import anime that were actually popular in Japan, (or willing to invest so much in children's show) so they had to resort to cheaper/lesser known anime to import. Sometimes we got an anime that aired a decade ago.

We absolutely loved [Madou King Granzort](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2818/Madou_King_Granzort). Because [Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3837/Mashin_Eiyuuden_Wataru) was too expensive to import due to its popularity in Japan, Korean broadcasting company opted to import Granzort and air it because it was cheaper to import, since it was axed from low popularity in Japan. Later when Wataru was imported, it flunked in Korea because it was seen as Granzort clone, when in reality it was the opposite. (I'm generalizing it)

[Ai Tenshi Densetsu Wedding Peach](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1533/Ai_Tenshi_Densetsu_Wedding_Peach) was imported instead of [Sailor Moon](https://myanimelist.net/anime/530/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon), due to Sailor Moon being too expensive to import. Wedding Peach became massively popular. When Sailor Moon finally aired later, it was considered Wedding Peach clone (but yeah, eventually Sailor Moon took over).

[Captain Tsubasa](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2116/Captain_Tsubasa) was too expensive to import, so [Moero! Top Striker](https://myanimelist.net/anime/3438/Moero_Top_Striker) was aired first and became a huge hit. Captain Tsubasa aired later and was simply not as popular because kids thought it was Top Striker clone.

[Juuni Senshi Bakuretsu Eto Ranger](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2757/Juuni_Senshi_Bakuretsu_Eto_Ranger) was played in elementary schools so kids could memorize Zodiac animals 

[Full Moon wo Sagashite](https://myanimelist.net/anime/122/Full_Moon_wo_Sagashite) aired on a cable children's channel and is considered all time classic for most Koreans. Koreans get suprised when most Japanese people don't know about it.

Aaaaaaaaaaand I've heard the anime below were pretty popular in Japan, but has MASSIVE fanbase in other countries, much more so than Japan.

[Grendizer](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1985/UFO_Robo_Grendizer) was massively popular in France,

[Voltes V](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1069/Chou_Denji_Machine_Voltes_V) was a cultural phenomenon in the Philippines.

[Saint Seiya](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1254/Saint_Seiya) has a huge fanbase in Latin America.

So, What are some anime that people may or may not know about, that were incredibly popular in your country?

Just wanted to know, I like watching old stuff and discover impact it has. And I thought it would be fun to share.",False,manga,1705698716.0,19atwin,

Watching Attack on Titan for the first time! Commentary and theories for Episodes 1-4,"Hello, everyone! So like the post title says, I’m watching Attack on Titan for the first time. I thought I might write down some thoughts and commentary to share with you (don’t worry, I don’t have a patreon and I’m not gonna try to get you to buy crappy merch with my name on it and I never will lol I just thought doing commentary might be a fun hobby).

This is actually my first anime, because my parents didn’t allow me to watch anime when I lived with them. But I live with my girlfriend now, so I can watch whatever I want lol this is my girlfriend’s favorite anime so I thought I’d start with it and see what the hype is about.

&#x200B;

\[Attack on Titan Ep. 1-4 Spoiler\] >!I should let you know that I do know some things about it. I know the premise, there’s people fighting giants called titans that eat people, I know the main character can turn into a titan and that he’s actually the bad guy (that’s probably why he can turn into a titan lol). I know there’s a lesbian couple that I’m apparently going to love, and a nonbinary character too. I know there’s a badass female main character, and I know this because she’s my main competition. My girlfriend just loves her lol She’s probably part of the lesbian couple. Aside from those things, I don’t think I know any other spoilers aside from maybe hearing some character’s names before, but I don’t remember any of them so it’s whatever.

I hope you enjoy my thoughts on the show, and please don’t spoil anything for me in the comments! Like, even if I ask a question or something, just don’t tell me the answer!

Episode 1

1. Wow, this animation is beautiful! And okay, we’re just jumping straight into it with the big skinless giant. Cool. Now some guys are chasing a titan in the woods on horseback and using ziplines to move around.
2. These opening credits are so cool! I like the song too, and I hope these translations are accurate. “Give us the freedom of dying starving wolves!”
3. ‘To You, in 2000 Years- The Fall of Shiganshina Part 1’ Is the episode title saying that the show takes place in the future? I saw them using cannons and swords in the opening credits so I assumed it was in the past.
4. Oh, Mikasa! I think that’s the name of the badass girl my girlfriend loves (she kinda looks a bit young for that, so I’m assuming this is a flashback. Actually it must be a flashback since I don’t think the big skinless guy has shown up yet but he’s the first thing we saw). And there’s people saying the walls are “the will of heaven manifest” so there’s religion in this show too. Somebody probably should have told my parents that, maybe they would have let me watch it lol
5. This grown ass man is offering these kids alcohol lol And he’s on guard duty too! Also, was that close up of a man decapitating a fish really necessary? Okay, that other guard just said they (I’m assuming ‘they’ are the titans) haven’t done anything but scratch at the wall for a hundred years. So are titans not intelligent? The ones we’ve seen so far in the opening did look kind of dumb and didn’t react to all those soldiers ziplining around it lol But if they were smart, couldn’t they figure out a way to climb the wall? And a few more seconds of watching answers that question lol the guard called them mindless and dead-eyed.
6. Wow, it looks like those guys in the green capes got their butts kicked. They were only fighting one titan! (unless there’s more offscreen that we didn’t see) Oh my God! They gave that lady her son’s arm! Honestly, if that was all that was left of him, I would have said to just leave the arm behind and tell her with your words. Why traumatize her any further?
7. His sacrifice meant nothing? (also, maybe just lie to the mom?) I knew this was going to be a dark show but wow!
8. Eren’s just smacking random people with sticks lol I think he has anger issues. Is he the main character who’s actually the bad guy? He’s getting a lot of screentime.
9. I like how those random bits of information just popped up in the middle of the episode lol I did read them though, that does help me picture the setting better. People live behind three giant walls then. Why three though? Wouldn’t one be enough? I imagine if the titans had a way of getting over (or under?) the wall then the other two would be kind of useless, wouldn’t they?
10. I love that Eren is brave enough to say ‘whatever’ to his parents lol I would have gotten a smack on the mouth for that. And Mikasa is a bad sister lol she threw him into a wall earlier and now she’s tattling on him. What’s their dad working on in the basement? The way the shot lingered on that key and Eren’s reaction makes it seem important. Probably something titan-related.
11. LMAO they’re not afraid of Eren at all but they are of Mikasa! Lol
12. Was that yellow lightning? And that big skinless titan just kicked through the wall! There’s already so many people dying, wtf! Why are all those other titans so short compared to the big one? And why do they have skin? I have so many questions. I need to rewatch that part cuz it’s taking me too long to type this lol
13. Oh my God, there’s bloody corpses under rocks! I hope they’re not going to get too gory. But I know the titans eat people and that could get so bad.
14. Mom’s gonna get eaten isn’t she? She’s trapped under a whole ass house! And she just said her legs are crushed and there’s one walking towards them! That drunk guard is gonna die too. No way he’s competent enough to fight a titan. Holy shit, that titan is scary. Why is it smiling? Oh, nevrmind lol he’s just bouncing. Grab the kids and go! Lol I shouldn’t laugh but that’s kind of funny. Show up and fight the titan! Nope, run away lol Also, sorry for not breaking this paragraph up. So much is happening so fast! I keep pausing and rewinding and then immediately have a new thought in the same scene!
15. Oh no, it’s not funny anymore. Oh no, they’re gonna show it, aren’t they? I don’t think I can watch this! Okay, I guess that wasn’t that bad. Not as bad as I was imagining was gonna happen.

Concluding thoughts- Well that was a great first episode! I’m sorry if my commentary has been kind of crappy. I’m sure it’ll get better once I know what’s going on more and know who everyone is and stuff.

Oh, but I do have my first theory! Okay, I’m pretty sure that blonde guy is one of the main cast. What if… he’s the main character who’s actually the bad guy? I thought it was Eren but hear me out (I know you already know so don’t tell me if I’m right or wrong!). He was talking about how humanity has to go outside the walls and how the titans could break through at anytime. What happened immediately after he said that? A giant titan shows up and breaks down the wall! And I noticed he didn’t try to help Eren and Mikasa save their mom!

My working theory is that he’s secretly the villain and somehow he’s responsible for the big skinless titan breaking the wall. Cuz if the titans could have broken it at any time, then why didn’t they? No, something made them do it, and I’m betting blonde guy’s responsible (I forget his name, sorry. I’ll try to remember it next episode).

Episode 2

1- “They first appeared over a hundred years ago, giant humanoid creatures with a taste for our blood” “We were shoved to the brink of extinction almost overnight” “the survivors erected Walls Maria, Rose, and Sina”.

Okay, I have thoughts. If the titans have only been around for a hundred years, where did they come from? And if humanity almost went extinct overnight, when did they find the time to build the walls? I have another theory (or sub-theory, anyway)! They didn’t build the walls in response to the titans killing almost everyone. The walls were already there when they used them to hide from the titans. Wasn’t that one guy saying something about how the walls are sacred? I bet they were like a giant church thing before the titans or something, Like Vatican City.

Unless I’m vastly overthinking it lol

2. Oh, the subtitles for the song are in japanese now instead of English. I kind of wanted to analyze the lyrics closer with the context of episode 1 but whatever. Oh, but I notice there’s a shot of Eren and blonde guy side by side, facing away from each other! Does that mean they’re the hero and villain of the story? I’m still suspicious of blonde guy lol Also, Eren and Mikasa are definitely older in this opening so that makes me feel better about my girlfriend being in love with Mikasa lmao I guess we’re getting a time jump at some point. Oh, they have guns too! But why use swords then?

3. Another guy preaching! I don’t recognize the Bible quote he’s saying, assuming that they use the same Bible we do. Why are the titans so weird? Some of them are small, some are huge, and that giant skinless one was enormous. I saw one with a big head and torso but tiny arms and legs! And oh my God. That titan picking that woman up by her head was somehow more distrubing to me than what happened to Eren and Mikasa’s mom. I don’t why, I think being picked up by just the head bothers me for some reason.

4. Why is Eren always hitting adults in the head? I agree with what the guard is saying here. There’s nothing they could have done. He’s not a coward, though, just smart. And oh my God, some of those titans are barely bigger than regular people! How do they eat people if they can’t even fit them in their mouth?

5. Thank you, narrator, for explaining districts lol

6. Armin! That’s his name! I’ll remember it this time. Also, why does Mikasa not seem traumatized at all by what just happened? Eren’s got a thousand-yard stare. Is it because she wasn’t watching their mother get eaten and Eren was? I hope so, cuz I don’t want to believe my girlfriend’s love interest is a bad person lol

7. They’re leaving all those people behind because the boat’s full! It’s Titanic all over again! Hah, and they’re sealing the gate too. Everyone is really effed, huh?

8. There’s another skinless one! And this one has hair and runs lol and wow, those cannons are useless. It just smashed through another wall! That’s what I was saying earlier! Why even have multiple walls? If they can break through one, they can break through all of them! Also, this second skinless titan can breath fire!

9. I’m glad they have random bits of information in the middle of this episode too. I hope they keep that up, it’s actually very helpful!

10. Oh yeah, I forgot about their dad. We didn’t find out what he’s working on in the basement. And wow, Eren has a scary face. I find it hard to believe that he’s the ‘main character who’s actually a villain’ now. That rage on his face and the way he vowed to kill the titans makes me think there’s no way he’s the one who’s actually controlling the titans. If he was, he’d never have let one eat his mom. It’s gotta be Armin! Another bit of evidence: we saw earlier that Armin was getting his butt kicked by those bullies and he called them stupid. He can’t fight (which makes us think he’s inoocent and not a threat) but he’s clearly smart. Smart enough to figure out how to control titans, maybe?

11. Ten thousand people were killed by the titans? Wow! I don’t know how many people there are in the walls total but that’s got to be a lot. And the dad is still alive! Oh shit, is dad a bad guy? What’s in that syringe? He told Eren to give him his arm and Eren called him insane. Wait, maybe he’s not a bad guy. He’s being scary but he said ‘this is the only way’ and told Eren to find the key. But why not just give him the key? Last we saw it, he had it, right? Eren just woke up, no way that was just a nightmare though. Oh wait, he already has the key lol mission accomplished, dad! Now what?

12. Another suspicious moment of Armin’s. They’re surrounded by starving refugees and Armin is getting extra food for him and his friends by having his grandpa lie to the people handing out food. They’ve got to be hinting that, at the very least, Armin’s somewhat selfish, right?

13. Eren’s picking another fight with another adult. Whoa, that guard just full on punched a kid in the face! Oh look at that, Armin’s rescuing Eren by manipulating the guard with his words. He’s a smooth talker!

14. It looks like today’s just the day for punching Eren’s face, isn’t it? Lol Maybe the reason he’s so aggressive is because of his sister. We’ve seen her beat him up twice now, and those bullies were afraid of her. Maybe Eren acts so crazy and aggressive because he’s overcompensating for her.

15. Why did she say “your mom” instead of “our mom” or just “mom”? Do they have different moms? I noticed Eren looks more like his mom than Mikasa. Maybe Mikasa takes after their dad? Also I literally lol’ed at Mikasa shoving that bread right into his mouth.

16- Oh my God. 250,000 people dead? Well, aside from the 200 who made it back. That’s insane! How many titans are there? It’s got to be a whole army of them!

17. All three of them are joining the military. I guess that makes sense, given the opening credits lol Oh, and they’re all older now! Hooray for the time jump! It’s no longer problematic for my girlfriend to have a crush on Mikasa!

18. These end credits are interesting but I can’t figure out if they mean anything. Planets and stars, Mikasa running through a field of bloody knives, one of which she’s holding? And she has short hair once she grows up! It looks good on her

Concluding thoughts: Okay, I’m starting to really get into this show now. I almost don’t want to say anything because I want to watch the next! Lol I don’t have any new theories but I do still think my “Armin is the bad guy” theory might be right. I’m gonna be keeping a very close eye on him.

Episode 3

1. The song lyrics are back to English! I can’t figure out if these lyrics mean anything yet, but they are badass nonetheless.
2. I know he’s being mean, but I love this drill sergeant. Oh wow, he just headbutted that guy with the prematurely graying hair lol Oh, they’re a monarchy, ruled by a King? File that away for later. He’s picking the bald kid up by his head, which is weirdly making me uncomfortable again. I guess I really don’t like that sort of thing. Wtf is that girl thinking? Why would you ever ever EVER eat bread at a time like this? Lmao he asks her what she thinks she’s doing and she just glances around and keeps eating! Oh wait, it’s a potato, not bread.

“It looked quite delicious and it was getting cold so I gave it shelter in my stomach, sir”. I think I’m in love. Oh, I really hope she’s one of the lesbians. OMG lmao she just broke off a tiny piece and told him to have “half”! How could you not love her?!

3. Wow, they’re all just grilling Eren on his trauma, huh? And “armored titan”? Is that the one with hair? I guess that explains why that cannon didn’t hurt him at all if he’s armored. And I guess he did seem to be covered in something but I assumed it was exposed fatty tissue.

4. Oh, prematurely graying guy is a douchebag. And apparently smitten with Eren’s sister at first sight lol

5. I don’t get what just happened. Prematurely graying guy wiped his hand on the bald kid’s back and said it was his ‘trust’. Can someone actually explain that to me please (unless the explanation contains spoilers, in which case just let me be lost)

6. Um… couple things to unpack here. One, is that Armin’s long lost twin sister or something? Two, is she not going to say anything about how Sasha (I’m pretty sure it’s Sasha. No one’s said her name in a while) just had her eyes glow red and leaped like fifteen feet to eat the bread out of her hands? Oh! The way that there seemed to be light and bubbles all around blonde girl and then a close up of Sasha’s eyes makes me think there’s attraction! Are Sasha and the blonde girl my lesbian couple?! I love them already!

7. Of course Mikasa is already the best at this zipline thing. Thank you to the mid-episode world-building lessons for explaining more about the ziplines!

8. Poor Eren! I mean, I know he’s gonna get it eventually cuz I’ve seen him ziplining around in the credits lol And another thing… when Eren is chewing Mikasa out, he says “after what happened to my mom” not “what happeend to our mom”. I really do think he and Mikasa have different mothers.

9. lmao Mikasa giving a speech to Sasha without realizing it. And then just taking the bread like that… that’s cold, man.

10. Eren and Armin are spending a lot of screen time with these two guys (I’ll learn their names soon, I swear!). They might be important side characters. I mean, we’ve met a lot of characters this episode but these two are the only one to have a big heart to heart with Eren and Armin. Okay, the blonde’s name is Reiner. Remember that!

11. Ooooh! Eren’s equipment was broken! I bet prematurely graying guy sabotaged him lol

Concluding thoughts- I love Sasha. That is all.

Okay, that’s not all. I really enjoyed that episode. It’s a nice respite after the freaking horror show that was the last two episodes. And I’m getting attached to all the new characters too! But… I know this is a dark show. How many are gonna die? :’( It better not be Sasha or that blonde girl! I still need to see them fall in love!

Episode 4

1. Oh, recap! “two terrifying new breeds of titan appeared: the Colossal and the Armored”. Okay, so are we for sure referring to the one with hair as the Armored Titan? And the other one is the Colossal Titan? I mean, it’s a fitting name lol
2. Two years after joining the cadets? And we already had a time jump too! Hold on… Remember when I said there’s no point to multiple walls if the titans can break through one? Why haven’t they broken through the other two yet if it’s been years? Clearly humans can’t stop them.
3. It’s cool of Reiner to help Armin out in boot camp. Blondes have to stick together lol
4. Thank you Drill Sergeant for reminding us slowly and clearly who everyone is and their dominant personality traits! Lol So prematurely graying guy is named Jean and he’s an insufferable smartass according to his superior. Bald guy is Connie and a “few sanwiches shy of a picnic” lol and Sasha is awesome. Pretty sure that’s what drill sergeant said: “Awesome”
5. Wait, Eren and Mikasa have different last names?
6. So Reiner’s like Eren’s mentor. And hey, are we finally going to get a scene with that blonde girl (can’t remember her name). She’s different from how she was last episode. A lot meaner based on the look she’s giving Reiner lol Oh, she’s about to kick Eren’s ass. Ooh, shin kick! Those hurt! And she wiped him out, as expected. LMAO and Reiner too! Lol
7. OH! It’s not the same blonde girl! I’m an idiot lol but her name is Annie. I like her. She’s tough, and I simp for tough women (maybe she’s one of the lesbians… why can’t they all be lesbians?) And she wrecks Eren a second time. But she’s imparting important wisdom on him. Don’t be a pawn!
8. So if I’m following this correctly, the ones who score the highest in their class go to the “interior” and don’t fight titans? And Jean wants that and that’s why he’s working so hard to be the best. So… their best soldiers never see combat? What kind of system is that? Eren’s right, it’s  messed up.
9. Reiner and Annie are giving Eren the eyes. He’s making them proud by kicking Jean’s butt. Do I sense some potential chemistry between Eren and Annie?
10. L.M.A.O! “Sasha passed some gas, Commandant.” “Why am I not surprised?” And then Mikasa force feeds Sasha some bread while Eren and Jean making violent sexual eyes at each other lol
11. Thank you for explaining the military branches! So everyone wants to be one of the unicorns, or MPs, but Eren wants to join the Scouts, who are represented by wings. And I think that drunk guard who saved Eren and Mikasa had the roses on his uniform so he must be garrison.
12. So basically, everyone who has a name made the top ten. Got it. Thank you mid-episode exposition for reminding me of their names lol
13. Annie’s giving him the side-eye again while he’s monologuing. And prematurely graying Jean is a jealous coward and I think he’s starting to realize it.
14. Wait, Captain Levi! I’ve heard that name before! And okay, drunk guards name is Hannes. Remember that! And aww I’m literally getting teary eyed. After all Eren’s raging, he forgives Hannes for not saving his mom.
15. Eren’s speech seems to have converted a few people to the Scouts. Oh my God, I love Sasha. I too shiver in pleasure at the thought of a good sandwich lol
16. It happened again! The yellow lightning and then the Colossal Titan just appeared out of nowhere! I could see behind Eren, and he did not walk up. He shot up from beneath the wall where the lightning hit! I rewound and watched it again and I caught it! He appeared out of nowhere, like he teleported! I don’t know what to do with this information yet, but I noticed it!
17. Okay, wall’s broken again. I guess the fun respite episodes are over. But look at my girl Sasha saving that falling guy!  And Eren cannot be the villain. He’s literally the only one trying to kill the Colossal Titan right now. Why would he do that if he was the one making it break the walls? Also, why is it back now? It’s been five years, right? It’s the day they graduate from the cadets. Does that timing mean anything or is it a coincidence? I also notice that Armin was nowhere in that scene when the Colossal Titan appeared. Could it be that he knowingly put himself at a safe distance? (I’m still on the ‘Armin is the villain’ train lol I know one of the main characters is and I’m pretty sure it’s him)

Concluding thoughts- I really freaking love this show. I can’t wait to watch the rest. If you enjoyed my commentary, which mostly seems to be just observation and lesbian panic, let me know! I plan to keep doing it, but even if I don’t I’m still gonna finish the show. It’s really good!<",False,manga,1705695343.0,19askda,

Need help finding a gothic looking anime,"So the I saw a clip of an anime trailer/edit and I accidentally refreshed my feed. From what I saw it was set in a gothic type town and there was a group of around 4 characters who appeared to be adolescents. One was a male with an old looking pistol (similar to the style of the one from Vox Machina) and a woman by a fountain and the other two i cant remember. The theme of it seemed to be oldern Europe and the animation looked quite good. The whole thing was set at night and there were lots of crows. Pls I know it's very vague but it looked so good and I've been looking for it for so long.

Delicious in Dungeon was a terrible name until it JUST clicked for me...now it is the best,"I always like to see how show titles and even dialogue within will be localized. Many shows do a great job, but I thought Delicious in Dungeon really blew it. It just was so bad for me. It literally meant nothing, and didn't indicate what the show would be about...less than Dungeon Meshi anyway.

So I was talking to a friend and I abbreviated Dungeon Meshi to DM. I thought to myself quickly how clever the Japanese title is compared to English that even the abbreviation references the source...then it clicked what the localized title was doing!

Should I continue watching Attack on Titan?,"This is truly just an honest question. I don't mean to offend any fans. We can have differing tastes and opinions on things, and that's fine, I'm asking on behalf of mine.

I absolutely loved season 1. I finally had the urge to rewatch it again after years so I can finally finish the show. Now coming up on season 2, I'm remembering why I dropped the show.

After s1, I followed the manga for a long time, and remember being bored and disappointed in the quality of the art (being spoiled by Berserk and all). I'm remembering why I dropped the show, was because of how irritating and boring I found Historia as a character and how she was suddenly shoehorned in as vital to the story. I get that she develops as a character or whatever, but I don't really care if she stops being a coward, I just find her painfully boring as a trope entirely. Reading up on a spoiler that her titan form so happens to have angel wings just has me rolling my eyes.

S1 was just so good to me in how the story kept moving along, and the soundtrack was top notch. I'm trying to watch season 2 again and find myself playing it at a faster speed just to get through it to see if S3 is any better. Having seen more of the manga than S2, I know that it still doesn't really pick up after a while. I just don't care about Historia as a character let alone her backstory or how her arc ends. I also found the dialogue/writing in general not very interesting.

However, I do like other characters such as Annie, Hange, Sasha, Erwin, and Levi. I want to see how their characters end up, but I'm just finding it hard to get through S2.Anyways, should I continue and give it a chance? Thanks.",False,manga,1705691439.0,19aqzj9,

Getting Back Into Mecha,"I'm in my late 50s and I remember fondly watching Starblazers and Robotech in the '70s and '80s in the USA. There may have been others, but none of them were combination robots (like lions that combine into an even bigger robot).

I'd like to watch them (and more like them) again, but I do want to respect my nostalgia. I know what we got in the US in the '70s and '80s was heavily modified, but I want to try to build on what I remember (or think I remember) rather than ignore it.

Is there a way to do that? I do have access to some stuff through my local library. Is anything streaming?

Is there anything else like this you would recommend? If I hadn't seen it before I don't have to honor any nostalgia and I would be open to more stuff.

Thanks!

EDIT: I should mention that I know Starblazers was originally Space Battleship Yamato, and that what I saw as Robotech was a combination of things including Macross (though I would have only seen the first season so that is probably Super Dimension Fortress Macross).",False,manga,1705688029.0,19apm7j,

Horror/Thriller/Mystery... or just Any Recommendations?,"Hi y'all! I was a big anime watcher as a kid/teen, like obsessive almost haha. But stopped and haven't watched anything since 2015/2016. 
I think the last animes I watched and (still) loved were Erased and Death Parade

I love horror/psychological or really anything that gets you into a gritty or dramatic story. Mystery is also fun to me, stuff where you follow along as things are solved or unraveled.
Although I do also like mundane slice of life, light hearted stuff as well to keep moods up. 

Anyone got any recs?
Again I haven't watched anything since 2016, so even recs from 2018 animes are good!

 I'll list animes (of no specific genres) that I like to maybe help give an idea (please don't cringe at some of these haha):

• Gangsta, Angel Beats, Death Parade, Erased, Corpse Party, School-Live!, Black Butler, OHSHC (lol), Death Note, Kiznaiver, Soul Eater, The Apothecary Diaries

Flavors of Code Geass characters,"*This post contains Code Geass Season 2 spoilers.*

We are used to thinking about character traits as something universal. For example, anyone can be ""cold"". ""Coldness"" is the same in everyone. That's the usual paradigm.

But we can change that paradigm. We can split any trait into a colorful spectrum. We can have 7 flavors of coldness. 7 flavors of kindness. 7 flavors of vulnerability. You name it. And we can have much more than 7, of course.

Splitting traits into multiple versions — and realizing the meaning of each version — would allow us to find connections between characters we wouldn't ever be able to figure out otherwise.

Do you care about Code Geass characters enough to investigate how they connect to characters in other stories? Even if it's gonna be a bit challenging?

## Trait flavors

Let's give some examples of trait flavors.

Lelouch's coldness signals his separation from specific people, his specific tragedies. CC's coldness signals her separation from the whole society or the whole world, as if she's an alien. Lelouch still cares about and engages with society a lot — CC doesn't give a shit. Lelouch's coldness is more palpable and angsty, while CC's coldness is more otherworldly and serene. He's a growling cold geyser, she's the surface of a frozen lake. Both characters can be cold, but their coldness has different flavors / vibes / meanings.

Suzaku's coldness isn't even ""cold"", it's barely able to hide his pent-up rage and saltiness. Nunnally's coldness is her defense against the world and her brutal determination to reach truth & justice — even if *reaching truth & justice* requires firing a couple of nukes on innocent civilians. Nunnally knows that being good isn't always easy. Her and Suzaku's kindness flavors appear deceptively innocent.

## What is the general method of splitting traits into flavors?

It requires analyzing each character on **three** levels:

1. ""Unique attributes"". They describe what makes a character stand out compared to other characters in the story.
2. ""Abstract contradiction"". It describes an abstract conflict at the core of the character.
3. ""Trait flavors"". They describe the special meaning behind generic traits of the character.

Attributes are like puzzle pieces, we need them to build a contradiction. Then we can use the contradiction to split traits into flavors. Attributes —> Contradiction —> Flavors. You'll see how it works with examples.

## ... ... ...

## Lelouch's unique attributes

What's unique about Lelouch Lamperouge, compared to other important CodeGeass characters?

* He's the loneliest character, yet the most social.
* He's one of the most affected by relationship grief/distress. Along with Suzaku.
* He has the most hidden tragedies.

## Lelouch's abstract contradiction

What's Lelouch's abstract contradiction? He has ***""the most contradictory connection to people"".*** On one level he's a social dude, on a deeper level he's a lonely manipulator, on a yet deeper level he's a social dude again.

## Similar characters

I think those characters share Lelouch's contradiction: (*""having the most contradictory connection to someone""*)

***Snape*** *from Harry Potter,* [*Elsa*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLzfXQSPBOg) *from Frozen,* ***Kakashi*** *from Naruto,* [*Scrooge McDuck*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMB3aYY5vOs) *from DuckTales 2017,* ***Darth Vader*** *from Star Wars,* ***Gandalf*** *from LOTR,* ***Amon*** *from Korra,* ***Patroclus*** *from Hades videogame 2020,* [*Carl Fredricksen*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWEW_qTLSEE) *from Up 2009,* ***Jeong Jeong*** *from ATLA.*

Some of them also share those unique attributes:

* They have a *mental relationship* with a person which is stronger than their *real relationship* with said person. Their life is completely reshaped by grief/distress from a past relationship.
* They put up a half-true facade of a withdrawn person. They may look like they are naturally withdrawn, but their withdrawnness usually hides a sad backstory. They have the most hidden tragedies.
* Gandalf is special. He's simultaneously a loner and the center of all communication/planning. So he, too, has ***the most contradictory connection to people.***

(Reminder. *Unique attributes* are like puzzle pieces from which we can build *abstract contradictions*. The same contradiction can be built from very different puzzle pieces. That's why seemingly unrelated characters — like Lelouch and Snape and Gandalf — may end up being connected. Unique attributes are the necessary ""evidence"" to back up the connections, without them the analysis falls apart. If you forget that, this post will seem like nothing more than a bunch of weak, vague analogies.)

## Lelouch trait flavors

Knowing Lelouch's abstract contradiction, we can figure out the meanings/flavors of his traits:

* Lelouch's coldness signals his separation from specific people, his specific tragedies. Similar to Scrooge McDuck and Esla and Carl Fredricksen.
* Lelouch's ""softie"" traits make his isolation from people contradictory. Similar to Scrooge McDuck and Elsa and Gandalf.

Some **iLiKETRAiNS** songs would fit Lelouch and similar characters (e.g. [A rook house for Bobby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjXKR6xVzAI), [Terra Nova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoHloQFJNvs), [Death of an Idealist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyuT5rZVe10), Stainless Steel, The Accident). They focus on irreversible consequences and tipping points of breakdowns. Those songs have ""Lelouch's voice"".

## ... ... ...

## CC's unique attributes

What's unique about CC, compared to other important CodeGeass characters?

* She is the loneliest character.
* She has the most unusual background and motivation.
* She's the most physically abused and mentally resigned.

## CC's abstract contradiction

What's CC's abstract contradiction? ***Her identity is undermined from the outside and from the inside.*** She has no societal status and she has a deathwish. Alternatively, ***she's just externally and internally weird***. (""Weird"" compared to other CodeGeass characters.)

## Similar characters

I think those characters share CC's abstract contradiction:

[*Sheldon Cooper*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VQu0SxdzI) *from Bing Bang Theory,* ***Draco*** *from Harry Potter,* [*Zuko*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLpfsSLRAA8) *from ATLA,* ***Gaara*** *from Naruto,* ***Kurisu Makise*** *from Steins;Gate,* ***lord Beckett*** *from Pirates,* ***Lapis Lazuli*** *from Steven Universe,* [*Sailor Mars*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor_Mars) *from Sailor Moon,* [*Kiki*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0D4hdRELJ8) *from Delivery Service,* ***Luka*** *from Miraclous,* ***Randall*** *from Monsters Inc.*

* Take Zuko. His identity is externally undermined (he's a noble who was banished) and internally undermined (his feelings are confused and messed up). He's the most externally and internally weird character of his story — he has the weirdest circumstances and the weirdest mindset.
* Take Sheldon Cooper. He's a genius, but he's placed in circumstances where his genius doesn't matter (his identity is externally undermined) and Sheldon is deeply confused by it (his identity is internally undermined). He's the most externally and internally weird character of his story.

(Reminder. *Unique attributes* are the bones. *Abstract contradiction* is the shape of the skeleton. *Trait flavors* is the shape of the meat on the skeleton. All those components should work together in order to make sense.)

https://preview.redd.it/q60wlhzaoedc1.jpg?width=1990&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6dac44a685c689b85fc917e3fb0f37b9ff6798a

https://preview.redd.it/a6yvrnzaoedc1.jpg?width=1727&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b187a3eda5f40765ba8a8b053788c99996ef77f

## CC trait flavors

Knowing CC's abstract contradiction, we can figure out the meanings/flavors of her traits:

* CC's coldness and calmness signal her separation from the whole society or the whole world, as if she's an alien. Similar to Sheldon Cooper and Gaara. Also Draco (he's separated from  the layer of society the story is focused on) and lord Beckett.
* Her vulnerability highlights her fundamental mental confusion and distress. Similar to Draco, Zuko, Gaara, Lapis, Sheldon and Kiki.

Everyone is vulnerable when they're confused and distressed, but CC's vulnerability is about the deepest confusions and distresses.

CC is a ""liminal being"", with no external status and unstable internal identity. Songs about characters in [liminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality) situations with liminal states of mind would fit her. Some songs of **The Cure** and **Ashbury Heights** are right for the job. E.g. [SmAlLeR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsPSmZ6lVSk) (a strangely dispassionate character in a world-shaking situation), [Derrick is a Strange Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3gDIsN5Lh4) (a strangely calm person intruding in a relationship); [Lullaby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijxk-fgcg7c) (a strangely calm character in a life-and-death situation), [The Same Deep Water As You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbAKp4HA7co) (strange situation, strange calmness). Those songs have ""CC's voice"", CC's calmness.

## ... ... ...

## Suzaku's unique attributes

What's unique about Suzaku Kururugi, compared to other important CodeGeass characters?

* He's the most ""unlucky"" character. The crap he's getting doesn't logically follow from his own story.
* He's a character who suffers the most / gets broken the most because of his connection to the main character.
* His ideals and goals get stretched and subverted the most.

>*""Your fucking moral compass is a Roulette Wheel!"" (c.) Lelouch about Suzaku's stretching ideals*  
>  
>*""I'll stop this violence the only way I know how: with more violence."" (c.) Suzaku*

## Suzaku's abstract contradiction

What's Suzaku's abstract contradiction? ***He gets the biggest amount of unintended shit.*** His girlfriend is accidentally killed by his friend; his friend turns out to be a war criminal; he is forced to fire a nuke against his will.

Some of them also share those unique attributes:

* They are forced to become Gods.
* They are dragged into adventures and intrigues.
* They have to deal with an unintended amount of other people's crap. Get caught in a crossfire a lot. Get an extra amount of abuse. Have a """"friend"""" who brings them trouble.
* They are forced to behave out of character. [Develop their darker side.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy9BuVyDTxo)

## Suzaku trait flavors

Knowing Suzaku's abstract contradiction, we can figure out the meanings/flavors of his traits:

* His coldness hides pent-up rage and saltiness. Similar to John and Gon and Will and Steven.
* His kindness appears deceptively innocent. Similar to John and Gon and Will and Steven.

## Kallen's unique attributes

What's unique about Kallen, compared to other important CodeGeass characters?

* She and Suzaku are the most confused and irritated characters. However, her confusion and irritation come from internal doubts.

## Kallen's abstract contradiction

What's Kallen's abstract contradiction? ***Her awareness/self-awareness makes it harder for her to fulfill her role.*** She's a powerful warrior, but people get into her head. She thinks too much!

## Similar characters

I think those characters share Kallen's abstract contradiction: *(""extra awareness makes the character worse or better at fulfilling their role"")*

## Kallen trait flavors

Knowing Kallen's abstract contradiction, we can figure out the meanings/flavors of her traits:

* Kallen's anger means her desire for true personal connection, without secrets and lies (e.g. when she points the gun at Lelouch to learn if she's geassed). Or her desire to defend something personal (e.g. when she slaps Lelouch on the bench).

Kallen can show the most non-toxic anger. The fire which hurts, but doesn't leave a poisonous burn.

## Mao's unique attributes

What's unique about Mao, compared to other important CodeGeass characters?

* His full story is the most ""hidden""; his full story is the most inconsequential for his current story. In the current story, Mao is just a crazy villain who can only be killed — his actual story is much deeper, but that doesn't matter anymore for his own fate.

## Mao's abstract contradiction

What's Mao's abstract contradiction? ***His motivation is more complicated than his role in the story / his motivation is different from his role in the story.***

* Take Edward Elric. His own motivation is to fix his and his brother's bodies, yet his role in the story is to just be a good guy. \[Fullmetal Alchemist spoilers\] >!And his original motivation doesn't matter much for the main plot.!<
* Take Knuckles. He's the defender of the Master Emerald and the last of his tribe and la-la-la but his role in the story is just to be a bad guy or a good guy. We can forget the backstory. We can ignore the specifics of his thoughts.

# Wrapping up

Thank you for reading this post. Feedback is welcome.

* Did the analysis change your perception of the characters in any way?
* What points were the hardest to understand/accept?
* Can you feel the ""trait flavors"" at least a little bit?

I know, my analysis deconstructs characters quite radically. But we could view it as a good thing and try discussing it.",False,manga,1705674099.0,19ak6vp,
Looking for an anime from the 2010s,"I need some help figuring out an anime which I only partially watched at a friend's house (who of course can't remember watching a show like that ever). It should be at least three years old, but didn't look to ancient, so I'd place it in the 2010.

The genre should be something like horror, mystery or adjacent.

It's in a modern day urban setting, looking rather serious and realistic.

It's winter and snowing and we're following a boy of school age (middle or high schooler) through town with his umbrella against the snow. At the roadside he sees a girl of his age standing there, looking absent-minded.

There are some news about deaths occuring in town from a wild animal or implied werewolf and there seems to be a connection to that girl.

That's it. I don't remember watching more than that.",False,manga,1705673143.0,19ajv09,
Anime that you can play to high school students,"I remember when I was in high school, my teacher would play Dead Poets Society and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest when the exam season’s over and there was nothing left for her to teach in the semester. What anime can have the same effect?",False,manga,1705672783.0,19ajq2h,
Gushing over Magical Girls gained big popularity in Japan,"This anime is a massive hit in Japan.

Currently, all three Blu-ray editions are in the top 20 sales on Amazon (while other anime of the season are much lower), and this is just for pre-orders. When the Blu-rays are released, they might climb even higher. EDIT: I just checked yesterday the blu ray was top 20, but today they are Top5 to 3

On the Niconico ranking, Episode 1 was ranked top1, and Episode 2 got the top2, with just a 0.3% difference from the first (Dungeon Meshi).

Apparently, the manga also got a significant boost in sales. EDIT: Top manga Amazon JP

Previews for the upcoming episodes are reaching 200kviews on YouTube for each episode, whereas the second-highest preview views (Dungeon Meshi) are around 100k. The opening is soon to reach 1 million views on YouTube.

This marks the seiyuu's (Fuuka Izumi) first lead role as a real character (her other roles were just background characters). Her performance is exceptionally well-received by the Japanese audience and has been praised by her more experienced seiyuu colleagues, so her career is off to a great start.

Another factor that contributed to its popularity, I believe, is that the Japanese had high expectations for the ""Mato Seihei no Slave"" anime but were somewhat disappointed with its quality. In contrast, for ""Gushing over Magical Girls,"" the Japanese had low expectations due to the studio ""Asahi Production,"" but in the end, they were pleasantly surprised to see it push the ecchi elements even further than the manga.

In summary, if it continues like this, the anime has the potential to be the number one hit of the Winter 2024 season in Japan!

A very good start to the year for Yuri

Today I learned that the Pokémon brand is worth far more than Yu-Gi-Oh!,"This wasn’t a topic I thought too deeply about in the past, if at all, but today I was watching some Yu-Gi-Oh and then I was thinking Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokémon are what got me and millions of other kids my age into anime, so they’re sort of like rivals. So, then I wondered what each of of their brands are worth. My simple brain was pretty surprised to learn that Pokémon was worth around a hundred billion while Yu-Gi-Oh is worth around 20 billion. I had always considered these two brands to be equal in impact, but when I thought about it this makes sense. As far I know, Yugioh is mostly only the card game and the anime. It hasn’t released any new video games other than Master Duel, which is free to play, in the past few years. Meanwhile, Pokémon is the video games, anime, trading card game, manga, toys, and whatever else it has in its ever expanding empire. Pokémon is simply a bigger media brand.

 Still, I don’t think I’m wrong in thinking that they’re equal in their cultural impact. I mean, for a lot of kids my age, Pokémon and Yugioh was the gateway into Japanese anime and entertainment. They introduced us to a whole new world. Even if Pokémon is the bigger and more valued franchise, I personally feel that they are equal in the effect they had on our lives and the things we like.

Also, as a side note, can we talk about how fricking crazy it is that Yu-Gi-Oh is worth billions now? For those who don’t know, Yugioh first started off as a manga about games rather than just the card game it inspired. It was created by Kazuki Takahasi. I heard it was in danger of being axed, but fans were interested in the card game he designed for one of the chapters and that led him to make it more important and eventually make the card game the main focus entirely. This led to its continued popularity and the rise of the trading card game we all know and love.

Seriously, do you all understand how insane it is that a manga that was in danger of being axed turned itself around and led to the creation of one of the world’s most popular TCGs that has world championships and is played by people all across the world, and is now a brand worth around 20 billion?! The manga was published in 1996 (the first Pokémon games were also released that year). So, in just 20 plus years, it became a franchise worth nearly 20 billion. Pokémon may have been destined for success from its first release, but who could have predicted Yugioh would become what it became at the beginning? Plenty of successful brands have rather humble origins, but this just stands out. Kazuki Takahashi left us too soon, but he left behind one hell of a legacy.",False,manga,1705669840.0,19aiqrt,

  I would prefer non-isekai but I’m not totally against it. (I’ve seen Overlord, Mushoku Tensei, Arifureta, HTSADL, TenSura).

So I watched Gurren Lagann in 2024,"I’m shocked I held off on this one for so long, because it was AWESOME! 

I’ll try to gather my thoughts because there is so much I enjoyed about this one. 

You are able to just embrace some of the more absurd moments purely because the anime is so earnest. I can appreciate something that knows what its identity is, and isn’t ashamed to  be itself. Encouraging, empowering, hopeful, and positive. Gurren Lagann is basically the anti- Evangelion, and far better IMO. If this had been my first anime, I could see myself giving it a 10/10, though I hold a few others even higher. 

The characters were enjoyable and believable even in the most crazy situations. And the time skip especially endears you to them. Yoko being my favorite unsurprisingly. And when certain anime today unceremoniously kill off characters without any real change to the story, Kamina’s death was extremely refreshing to see. Sad of course, but he isn’t forgotten either, he makes his mark on the story all the same. I felt in that episode, even though i saw the flags all around him. 

Animation holds up, I’m impressed just how Gainax did it, even with 2010s and 2020s anime increasing the bar constantly. 

If there’s one thing that astounded me the most, it would be the scale. From underground, to surface, to proper civilization, to interstellar space. The world building is grandiose, and I appreciate it.  Not to mention spanning over 7 years with all the established characters in new places and occupations.  

It is a love letter to the indomitable human spirit and as cheesy as it sounds on paper, it works here just great.

Some of my current favourites that relate to Mature and Relatable are Chainsaw Man, Vinland Saga, Goblin Slayer, Another, Parasyte.

Some of my current Beautiful romance favourites are Violet Evergarden, Your Name, Howl's, Parasyte.

I like to feel emotions, anime is an outlet for it. One Piece checks off ALL the boxes. You fall in love with all the characters and care about them. You cry for a FUCKING BOAT. You get mad at the evil shit the World Government is doing. You get disgusted at shit Stain Charlos does. You're amazed at WHITEBEARDS POWER as well as other crazy cool strong characters.

Other honourable mentions: Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, My Hero Academia (notably season 6), Naruto (notably non-shippuden), As cringe as it even is, I enjoyed the story in Darling in the Franx. The Promised Neverland.

What’s an anime that unexpectedly became a miss?,"Not all anime lived to their popularity as the time they got previewed, some ended up becoming irrelevant as soon as the first month of airing for one reason or another.

One good example would be Detective is Already Dead. The first episode was alright despite the unclear direction, but the second episode gave a big dent on the series' reception, also doesn't help that the show ended up going all over the place trying to appease every niche but failed to catch one.

On a similar note, Re:Creators. Reverse Isekai is pretty uncommon at the time, so the trailer full of attractive character design and action gave people wrong expectations to become the ""Next Fate:Stay Night"". The exposition in the first few episodes broke the pacing.

One other case was Azur Lane. The game was already big internationally so it's not a surprise that the first anime was hyped, and the first episode surely delivered with more questions than answers, and people were quick to compare it to Kantai Collection. Unfortunately, the fanservice episodes every other week broke the pacing, and the ones that actually move the progress forward was bugged with mediocre animation that gave the impression as if the entire budget was wasted on the first epiosde. Ultimately, the anime had a lackluster storyline that fails to expand the game's lore (at least at the time). Doesn't help that the last two episodes were aired much later due to production issues. I guess that's the consequence for pushing the pilot episode to be aired during [the main character's IRL launch date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(CV-6)).",False,manga,1705636185.0,19a9sqw,

Attack On Titan Essay (Contest Entry) SPOILERS!!,"&#x200B;

Wow. It's…been a **long** ride. One full of **excitement**, fear, strength and **tears**. I don't think any anime, or piece of media, has tugged on my heartstrings and left me in shambles quite like AoT. Countless components made AoT the unforgettable and impactful anime it was. But what shocked me most of all was how well the anime transitioned into new phases and how it managed to demonstrate change through the **soundtrack**, **unforgettable characters**, and **plot twists**. Each of these crafted an amazing experience.

Please be aware; there are **major** spoilers up ahead.

https://preview.redd.it/4fv0dncesadc1.png?width=196&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6d883c5a67c99e61379e37ae6a96d20ca298e6c

Moving on, the soundtrack is, least to say, beautiful. It transforms slowly throughout the anime, showing the change of genre and how greatly music can demonstrate the transformation of an anime.

Each opening captures the essence of the corresponding season. Shingeki No Kyojin, Opening 1, captures the determination and strength the 104th recruits possess to bring peace to their homeland. This specific line, ‘They’re the prey, and we’re the hunters’, demonstrates their confidence and hope in defeating Titans.

Harmony is used in the background to show how all scouts are fighting for the same thing. Electric guitars, as well as the upbeat tone, symbolise the fast paced nature of the show, and the sad yet inspirational lyrics symbolise the dark themes of the show.

One specific lyric ‘Even if you pray, nothing will be changed. But that which can alter the present is the resolution to fight’ aids the message of taking action, and, as Armin Arlert said,

*""A Person Who Cannot Sacrifice Everything, Cannot Change Anything.”*

Season 2’s opening is my favourite. It demonstrates the sacrifices scouts have to make in order to achieve a brighter future. ‘Dedicate! Dedicate! Dedicate your hearts!’ hammers in this message, as well as ‘I wonder what expression our faces had, what our eyes conveyed. As we focused on our goal’. This specifically talks about persistence and continually moving on. As in the previous opening, an upbeat and fast paced beat is used to demonstrate the pace and hope of the show

Finally, season 4 has two openings; ‘My War’, and ‘Rumbling’. I found My War to perfectly portray the themes present in season 4; brutality and war. ‘Angels playing disguised..in devil’s faces’ talks about how the world views those on Paradis Island as devils - although they are actually innocent. Children in the harmony and this line, ‘Children cling to their last coin’ comments on the brutality of war and how many innocent children are affected, or die, due to the tragic situation.

The song has a militarial feel with the constant repeated lyrics and messages of ‘winning the war’ (’This is my last war’).

Additionally, ‘You are the real enemy..’ describes the complexity of Attack On Titan; it is unclear who is in the right or the wrong, yet both sides have their reasons to fight each other, so view each other as the enemy, which prolongs conflict. It demonstrates how both sides have their own humanity and struggles, yet fail to see the other side having the same.

Something else that makes AoT the masterpiece that it is the characters and character development. Each character develops in a new way, and there are no shallow characters. This creates an emotional and impactful experience. I’ll be referencing a few characters in extensive detail this section, so buckle up!

https://preview.redd.it/ivu6rqiduadc1.png?width=188&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb0b8aec5dfe2fcd5f834869f70991fad45917bc

To begin with is Eren Yeager. In the beginning, Eren is a determined and outgoing boy, whose goal is to ‘kill all the titans’ and reach freedom. He reaches this point when Armin teaches him about the possible outside globe - he realises his lack of freedom, and the distant, beautiful world that had been taken from him. This drive helps him move forward in his goals.

&#x200B;

[S1 - S3 Eren](https://preview.redd.it/aursv3q92bdc1.png?width=1073&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5f0f29b132e105c67a0d607c2d0ae44a0f0b5af)

However, as we progress through the book, **his perspective is really opened**. It seems as if his character greatly develops, however, it is clear that he had been like this from the start, and our perception of him had simply changed. Transformation is seemingly obvious, yet it's much more deeper than that.

This is because in the beginning, Eren constantly stated how ‘he was born into this world’ as a justification for the things he did. This implies his true nature was to obtain freedom from the day he was born. This is backed up by Mikasa,

*""Everyone says Eren has changed. Even I believed it. But maybe that's wrong. If that’s who Eren truly was all along.. Eren hasn’t changed one bit from the start.*”

This is not to say that Eren’s actions were excusable, rather, they were a cause of his nature.

1. We slowly see Eren reveal himself to be an ‘antagonist’. One who seemingly values the lives of a few over millions. It is understandable that he would want to protect his friends and fight for freedom, however, taking the Rumbling as an approach was, least to say, extreme. It is important, however, to consider that the world demonised and planned to exterminate those on Paradis Island from the beginning; including Eren and his beloved friends. This is a significant reason why the Rumbling occurs, and this is identified by a Marleyan commander in the last episode of the anime:

*“All the problems arising from our faults we dumped onto the “island of devils.” As a result, that monster was born and now it’s marching our hatred right back toward us.”*

This may seem to contradict the statement that Eren’s nature is to obtain freedom. I personally believe that Eren’s actions were a cause of nature and nurture. The environment he grew up in, and the person he was born as.

1. Eren’s character contains many flaws and contradictions, such as his ongoing desire for ‘freedom’ despite being a slave to the powers he possesses. How, exactly, is he a slave in this regard? Well, Eren has no freedom in his actions, as he knows that any decisions he makes are not mainly of his own accord, rather, what follows the timeline he foresees using the Attack Titan’s powers, and has no choice to follow. This makes him unfree in his choices, and therefore his life.  

2. One of the reasons Eren is so well written is the fact that his motivations are clear to identify. Numerous tragic things had occurred to lead him to his position of ‘the villain’. These things make his character tragic and easy to empathise with. This includes:  


* The Nature which he had been born with
* A life stuck inside closed walls
* Watching his mom being eaten alive.
* Realisation of Life outside the walls; shattered dreams
* Racism towards his island
* Realising his father was an ‘evil’ man
* Having the world demonise him
* Many of his comrades dying.

This does not excuse the actions that he took. **Genocide is never ‘okay’**. However, it was clear that the situation was desperate, and he believed this was the only feasible option to reach the outcomes he desired. There may have been many options other than the rumbling, but they came with the high likelihood the Paradis would be destroyed in the near future. Therefore, Eren’s actions fit with his motivations and backstory.

Overall, AoT creates a compelling and tragic main character. His motivations to reach his goal are clear and provide reason for his actions. Eren Yeager differs from the MC of most animes, as his role changes drastically through the anime (Protagonist/Antagonist).

&#x200B;

Moving on, another well crafted character is Levi Ackerman. Personally, Levi is my favourite character; both personality and appearance wise. He is also one of the charecters which, I would argue, underwent the most trauma, yet went through the least transformation. The creators intentionally made it this way; this is why he is such a popular and well written character.

&#x200B;

1. Firstly, Levi is so well written due to his consistency and contrast to the rest of the characters in the show. Levi sees titans as a non-threat; it is easy to slaughter them. He slices their napes in a blink of an eye (heh, one eye, if you know what i mean-), and is regarded as Paradis’ best soldier. This is seen in many examples, such as in season 3 episode 54, the iconic Levi vs Kenny scene, and unfortunately, season 4 episode 14.

This attitude towards titans is one of a kind, as other scouts fear titans immensely and shiver at their appearance. Additionally, his ability to murder titans is consistent, even in the last episode of the series, where he kills Zeke with two fingers, one eye, a bitten leg and various injuries. This demonstrates the true extent of his power.

&#x200B;

1. Additionally, Levi has clear motives towards his actions. Throughout his life, Levi has been a witness to the brutal murder of his comrades. Whether this be Petra and the others in season 2, Erwin in season 3, Hange and his scout group in season 4, or thousands of others; it has undoubtedly pushed him to keep surviving. He feels a need to give the dead’s lives meaning, which wouldn’t happen should he give up and not utilise his advanced power. Erwin’s final speech emphasises the importance of giving meaning to fallen comrades:

*“We die trusting the living who follow to find meaning in our lives!”*

This gives an explanation to why he continuously tries, gives his all and dedicates his heart in every battle.  


1. Moving on, before Erwin goes forward with his suicidal charge, Levi takes over Erwin’s guilt by ‘making the choice’ and making a promise to Erwin.  


“*Give up your dream and die. Lead the recruits straight into hell. I will take down the beast titan.”*

He attempts to acknowledge Erwin’s excellent and strategic leadership, as well as place honour in his death. This speaks to how important Erwin is to him. Therefore, killing Zeke, the beast titan, would be extremely important after Erwin’s death, especially with the loyalty Levi possesses.

&#x200B;

1. Finally, Levi’s character traits don’t align with his appearance. As stated before, Levi, canonically, is the most emotional character in Attack on Titan. However, his appearance says otherwise. He often presents as harsh. This can be seen in season 1, when he beats up Eren in court, or in the ‘Royal Government Arc’, where he puts his foot in an opponent’s mouth to get them speaking. However, in each of these instances, he had been fighting for a better cause. In the case of season 1, it was in order to stop Eren from being executed and dissected. In the Royal Government Arc, he needed to get answers in order to save Eren and Christa (Historia).

He can become significantly more brutal when facing his true enemies, such as Zeke. When first met with Zeke (out of beast titan form), Levi shoves a sword up the inside of his head. This, however, is justified and necessary as doing so instils fear in the opponent and Zeke had murdered thousands.

&#x200B;

1. On the inside, we can see that Levi is kind and caring; someone who truly cares for his comrades. This can be shown in season 2. In this season, the scout group closest to him is stamped on and thrown around by the Female Titan. Even the one arguably closest to him; Petra. Passing her body, he picks up her badge. Later in the mission, two devastated friends urge Levi to allow them to pick up their friend’s fallen corpse. In an effort to not lose any more comrades, Levi gives them the only memory of Petra left; her badge, and lies to them about who’s it really is. There are many other examples of Levi’s caring nature, such as in the end scene of AoT, where he is seen giving candy to children. This shows the audience that without his strength and the need to fight, Levi, deep down, wants to care for others. It reveals his loving nature.

&#x200B;

Perhaps, and this is just a theory, he would want to help others have a better life than him. A life without a childhood full of malnutrition, filth, violence and poverty. A life without an endless fight for freedom. A life with simple joys like lollipops. And most of all, a life without despair and sadness; a life where those closest to you aren’t killed before a proper goodbye.

&#x200B;

1. I believe that Levi is truly one of the most well crafted characters. His trauma and upbringing, as well as his empathetic and kind nature all contribute to a complex, interesting character. This is evident in the fact that fans all over the globe adore him. He isn’t just a pretty face or a stoic badass. He’s multi-dimensional.

To put it into simple words, Levi Ackerman’s title, “*Humanity’s strongest soldier”* describes him perfectly. Not only because of his faultless physical strength, but because of his endurance, perseverance, and personality.

At first, I didn’t appreciate the complexity of Reiner’s character. I believe many can say the same. But looking back at the anime, it’s clear that Reiner was one of the most well-crafted characters in Attack On Titan. He is an embodiment of what can psychologically occur as a result of the dire conditions of conflict. And his charecter helped me go through my own transformation; a transformation of my perspectives on the various sides of war in AoT, which translated into reality.

&#x200B;

1. Firstly, we can observe how discrimination and social-environmental stressors play a role in Reiner’s character. As a young boy, Reiner was unloved by his father whom he was restricted from seeing. He was an illegitimate child of an Eldian woman and a Marleyan wife, and so was discriminated against for his race; as many others were. His mother, Karina, told him that he would live a great life; giving he’d train and become a Marleyan soldier. And so, he worked and trained to become one, despite a lack of strength. However, he learnt that he could never find love through his father; and needed something to keep him going. Here-forth, he adopted the idea of pushing on to protect the people of Marley, to ‘save the world.’

“*Everyone had to be drunk on somethin' to keep pushing on … everyone was a slave to somethin'. ” -* Kenny Ackerman

This gives an insight into Reiner’s motivations, and how unloving treatment from parents, as well as discrimination from society caused him to become a mess and become *drunk* on things not achievable - saving the world and being loved and accepted by his family.

1. Moving on, it is clear throughout the anime that Reiner has a split personality alongside survivor’s guilt. As mentioned above, Reiner invaded Paradis island to ‘save the world’ from the island devils. However, upon invasion of Paradis, it was clear that the ‘devils’ were far from evil; rather, they were kind hearted and, in many ways, just like him. Reiner discovers his whole life was spent in a weak, untruthful house. Now the roof had fell and the tiles had bruised him.

Not only did he have to deal with the realisation that there were no devils, but he also learnt that the reason he became a war candidate was Marcel’s attempts to save his brother. Shouldering the guilt of Marcel’s death, Reiner began to develop severe internal conflict.

&#x200B;

1. His mission against the island ‘devils’ remained, but we see his acts of kindness on the island numerous times. In season 2, episode 4, Reiner saves Connie; despite him being an ‘enemy.’ These contradictory actions show the audience that Reiner is nothing but a victim; he had no choice in developing the beliefs and taking the actions he did. Knowing that he had to continue, Reiner copes with these disturbing situations, such as Marco’s death or his murder of thousands, by switching between personalities. This can be observed in season 2, episode 9; where he unknowingly switches between being a soldier and a strong Marleyan warrior. This highlights the impact of war and how no side is evil, rather, their perspectives are hidden from each-other. Being the one to discover this new perspective is, putting it in simple terms, a heavy burden to hold.  

2. Reiner becomes a source of hope almost; a symbolism to keep pushing on for *something*. As many other characters are, an embodiment of Kenny’s statement. Reiner was a slave to perseverance. No matter what he did, he could not die.

This is the part of the anime where many gained insight into Reiner’s place in the story and removed their negative view of his character. This discovery highlights how well foreshadowing and connections were done to ensure that Reiner’s personality, thoughts and actions matched up with his backstory and motivations in later seasons. Reiner has many more interesting characteristics up for exploration.

**Transformation of Perspective through Plot Twists**

In the duration between the releasing of an episode, I found it hard to not have AoT’s genius plot twists consume my thoughts with wonder and questions. Every once in a while, episodes left me in total shock. It took me a few hours to digest what I had just watched and the mechanics behind it.

One Episode that left me in a daze was season 4, episode 20. In this episode, we are brought to the paths where we learn Eren manipulated Grisha. This is introduced in such an immediate and blunt way.

*‘On your feet dad.’*

This changes the viewer’s perception of the whole series, causing the audience to suspect the motives of Grisha and how they view him as a character and father. Most of all, it creates a dilemma in the viewer - is Eren the antagonist or protagonist - is he ‘good’, or ‘evil’? This is something that can be subjective in the eyes of the viewer. This scene definitely demonstrates how far Eren goes to reach his goals, and his hopelessness of a perceived fixed timeline.

Another honourable mention is the reveal of the Colossal and Armoured titan. For me, this didn’t come as a total surprise. However, it was to many, and the execution; whether you could predict it or not, was perfect. The sudden statement Reiner makes is comical and casual.

*‘I’m the armoured titan, and he’s the colossal titan.’ -season 2, episode 6.*

Who would expect such a devastating discovery to come out in such a way? This makes the revelation all the more jaw-dropping and causes the audience to question the feelings, motivation and plan Reiner and Bertholdt have.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Overall, Attack On Titan is an anime I would recommend for all mature audiences. It leaves a mark on the viewer like no other piece of media. By delving into deep topics such as multiple sides of war, grief, brutality and decision-making - whilst balancing it with realistic, well-rounded characters, insights into relationships, and the beauty of life, it correctly represents the emotions and desires of humans. Despite including fantasy; The Titans, the anime manages to create a realistic anime of which many principles can be applied to reality. Various scenes can be described as cinematic masterpieces and challenge the stigma around anime. Most of all, the anime provides an example of how transformation can be used in all areas of a piece of media to improve the content.",False,manga,1705630285.0,19a7tna,

Help me find a REALLY obscure anime from childhood,"Please I'm starting to think I might actually be insane because I keep looking for this really specific anime OVA/Movie that I swear I watched when I was a kid but every time I search for it I always find NOTHING.

The hard part about this is that I only remember really SPECIFIC scenes that stuck with me but not the plot itself? 

* First the scene that's stuck in my mind the most: There's definitely a scene where the main character (don't remember his appearance or demeanour at all) sees a disembodied corpse on the street after a car crash or something, the body was being transported by a vehicle and it's limbs might or might not have been in a bunch of jars full of blue liquid.

&#x200B;

* There's a war scene, probably at the beginning of the movie, I do remember tanks and also maybe mechas, but I'm not so sure about the mechas.

&#x200B;

* There's a scene with a girl with long pink hair standing in front of a cherry blossom tree, she probably disappears right after but I can't confirm if that's the case either.

&#x200B;

* And this scene is the weird one, I don't know if it's from the same movie? But it probably is, there's a weird vine guy, with plant powers I guess, they fight him, I remember him appearing really late on the movie when they're in some kind of cave and there's huge vines all over the place, again, this one is weird.

I was born in the 2000's in brazil (so it was probably dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese), might have watched when I was 5-9 years old, rented it from a video store and definitely didn't return it lol, at the time I also rented FF7:Advent children so that might help with the time frame, in my head this anime looked old, like from the 80s or 90s.

A friend of mine got talking about it, and we started thinking of a different kind of arc for what could've taken place after the Greed Island arc.

If the Chimera Ant arc was about the Phantom Troupe instead, and that was used for the big climactic showdown of Gon and Killua’s journey, along with some changes made to using already established characters and having more screen time given to Gon and Killua, and also some changes to stories and motivations, along with learning why some of the Troupe started living the life they do now in the first place, while still using the morality system of the Chimera Ant arc, do you think that’d be better, or worse, than what we got?

>Where have you bee*n lately?* This guy knows Lain by sight, and she is apparently actually a regular here. She plans the raves even? Oh my gosh, Other Lain is crazy. How did she end up with such an extreme personality split? 

> Oh my gosh even these kids know her by sight. And how was she in the Wired on her old kids Navi? I'm starting to think these Men In Black are keeping an eye on her for a very good reason, Lain might be quite a criminal in her alternate personality. 

> Okay that was the fastest we have ever seen Lain move at the end there, the most expressive she has ever been, and the most engaged with another person outside her obsession with Dead Friend. I'm thinking that the advanced computer is letting Wired Lain come to the surface more somehow?

Can’t find a specific boxing anime. Help pls?,"When I was a kid there was a boxing anime that came up on tv. I don’t remember much about it except this one episode. 

In that episode the MC is going up against an opponent whose gimmick is that he behaves like chess pieces. He is laying into the MC by changing up which piece he is acting like. The MC notices a piece on the opponents back and steals it in hopes of  being able to beat him. The pieces turns out to be a pawn and is pretty much useless. 

If it helps the main character has a circular face, bald head with a small pony tail and very fat lips. 

I can’t find any sign of this existing other than my memory of it. The only result that comes up  is Hajime no Ippo which definitely isn’t the anime I am looking for.

Looking for Ecchi Anime recommendations,"Got into Anime a couple months ago for the “plot” and now I’m in it for that but also the ACTUAL plot. 

I’ve watched two Ecchis so far, Strike the Blood (which was phenomenal besides for season 4) and Highschool DxD (which I finished a couple days ago — I’m sad that there isn’t a season 5). 

Both in all honestly were kinda long for what I wanted, but I also don’t want to watch something super low-quality and confusing due to the lack of episodes. 

Here’s some things I’d like:

- Relatively short (3 seasons/36 episodes or less)
- No sex scenes, but nipples uncensored (don’t judge me)
- Average episode length is around 20 mins 
- Has supernatural stuff in it (demons, vampires, superpowers, whatever).

Stuff currently on my “list”, if this helps too (some might not meet the requirements posted above):

- How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend
- Hybrid x Heart Magias Academy Ataraxia
- Edens Zero
- Highschool of the Dead
- High-rise Invasion
- FairyTale 
- Kill la Kill 

Edit: has ENDED (so I’m not left on a cliffhanger/waiting for weekly episodes)

Are there any anime ABOUT fighting games?,"I'm not talking about anime that feature fighting games in them, nor anime based on fighting games. I mean an anime where the main focus is playing focus is playing fighting games. Cause it feels weird that after all these years, I have yet to hear of even one. Fighting Games are basically the closest real world equivalent we have to being in a Shonen anime, aside from like Boxing or something. That feeling of always striving to improve, never giving up even in the most dire circumstances, the intense mental gymnastics mixed, along with requiring the physical execution to actually play out that plan, all leading up to a big tournament with thousands of people in the audience.

Between that, and the popularity of sports anime as well as stuff like Yu-Gi-Oh, a fighting game anime should be an obvious choice. But I have yet to hear of one.

Trying to Predict Crunchyroll Award Winners 2024,"Just wanna do some predictions.

Anime of The Year:  It's tied between Oshi no Ko and Vinland Saga 2 as these have not won on this category before and these two has unique stories although based on previous winners which are all popular, it might be Chainsawman. JJK is popular but already won before. Surprised AOT isn't nominated but it already won before so I think it would not win nonetheless.

Best Continuting Anime: AOT because it has an ending and can be a send off to the series. Even though One Piece has been great this year, it already won before for this category.

I am looking for a very specific animated movie from 1981," 

Hi Everyone,

I had the chance to watch a movie when I was younger, that I have been looking for my whole life. I am especially trying to find the music from the end credits of this movie. The song seems to be stuck in my head and actually pops up at the most unexpected moments...

After many hours of looking, it took me about 14 years to figure out the movie it might be. The name of the movie is ""Undersea Encounter"". It was in english; the original is actually Japanese...it's called "" War Under the Sea: *20,000* Leagues of Love. 海底大戦争 愛の*20,000*マイル (Japanese) ""

Ive been looking for the song that plays during the end credits of the movie. It starts with the words    ""Under the Sea..."" <During this part of the music, 2 seagulls can be seen flying across the screen. These are the only things I actually remember very vividly, the words after this are kind of lost to memory.

When it was released in 1981, it was dubbed into many languages, and as the language changed, the soundtrack got changed as well. The version I'm looking for is held by an American company called Harmony Gold. I've been able to find the Japanese, Latino and French versions of the movie, Online, on youtube, but the music I am looking for isn't on them. The 2 seagulls are there, but the music is very different.

If anybody does find the song, somewhere, I'd be happy to hear it, too.

Thank you.",False,manga,1705579014.0,199oi78,

Anime similar to Zom 100,"I just watched zom 100 and thought it was one of the most surprising anime I watched recently. I went in not expecting much since other zombie anime have not been that great for me, but after each episode I got more hooked and the story unfolded and I got more attached to every character. I searched for anime similar to it, but most sites recommend High School of the dead or other anime that don't have the same subtleties and are not as intricate as zom 100.

Anime suggestion with people who STRUGGLE,"Allow me to elaborate. I loved Fire Punch, SAO Abridged, Chainsawman, Welcome to tge NHK, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, Library of Ruina, Limbus Company, Kaiji, etc.

I'm looking for SOMETHING, throw it all, anime, manga, movies, videogames, whatever, about terrible people. People who barely manage to classify a human beings with how dysfunctional they are. Be it mental illness, biases, upbringing, doesn't matter, if they are complex sociopaths, better. I want to see people who are at their absolute worst, but not in an overly exaggerated way like, Kuzu no Honkai for example which is pretty much just a soap opera. Those are welcome too of course so feel free to recommend but I mostly want a series based on people professionally shooting themselves on the foot, that their failures come not only from the struggle they face but from having to deal with their own mishaps as human beings, that when someone truly fails it actually sticks, that the consequences of their actions create waves that resonate across the whole story.

I want to see people who truly struggle to do the right thing not just because of moral quandaries but because it goes against their very own, faulty nature. I want to see frigging Johan Liebert, against his better judgement, without any drive to do so, try to straighten his path even without any certainty of ever achieving it or any hope of him being satisfied in the end, only because it's the right thing to do and even the smallest of attempts could be worth something. 

And ABOVE ALL OTHER THINGS, I also want to see these failures, these complete wastes of air, fight their way through all this to find themselves somewhere better than where they started, even if only slightly so. I've seen plenty of sad stories of people who reap what they sow. Now I want to see people who actually manage to break through the shackles they placed on themselves to be better, who knowing that the cards are stacked against them by their own hands, they will still try to be better.

I know this was rambly and sometimes redundant but I'm looking for a very specific kind of story and I really hope someone here can help me.",False,manga,1705547513.0,199g14r,

The Mc was white, blonde hair, blue eyes. They end up also going to some weird dark world in a giant castle to save thier brother or smth?

The SECOND one is of this little girl who escapes this tetsing facility and sues magic via crystals and gets found by this old man who acts liek ehr father figure n stuff

One character has magic based off of her dead husband, he was like thes etwo balls ghost hands that were always around her-
Anyways the girl ends up passing out and they take her back to the facility to help her I think.

"Are there any anime that outright go ""it's not just the 'Bad Guys', the entire structure of our world is the problem""?","So I was watching [HBomberguy's video concerning RWBY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81fdKWOHrdE) (not anime I know, but humor me here) and part of the video that resonated with me was how the RWBY creative team *tried* to do a political message with the Faunus - basically racism against beastmen - but half-assed it because they only took the most basic tropes and played it safe with the implementation. The fact that a society is biased against Fauni aren't the problem, it's just that some people are bad and if those bad people are gone then everything will magically go back to normal and we can go back to pretending nothing bad is going on. 

Anime-wise, I noticed this a bunch with some shonen anime. Naruto had a whole society based off child soldiers, but when he saved the world and caused peace between all the nations... they still train child soldiers. My Hero Academia has established problems with hero society, but they're mostly pushed to the side to focus on AFO and Shigaraki because *they're* the problem and once they're jailed, society will go back to normal. And this isn't even an anime-exclusive thing - Harry Potter spends like seven books showing issues plaguing the wizarding world, issues that aren't solely tied to Voldemort alone, but we're just supposed to believe that once Voldemort was dead all the problems with the HP world would just evaporate and Harry wouldn't need to change anything in his life afterwards. He's just an ordinary trust fund baby that grew into a cop.

Anyway, I know that intro was me trying to find a solid definition for what I'm looking for, but in general I'm looking for anime and manga which *don't* just push all the issues plaguing the world on one set of bad guys - instead acknowledging that their society caused the issues that created the bad guys, and they work to fix that.

My criticism of A Silent Voice,"Before you say “You just didn’t understand it”, I will say I watched this movie twice and I hated it both times. No better time than any to join in and discuss what I disliked so much. 

Shouko - She is hardly a character at all. We don’t get to learn about her wants or goals other than having a crush on her childhood tormentor. Never does she really grow a spine either, and decides to then commit suicide because she feels like a burden. Nothing more than a plot device and vehicle for your sympathy. She doesn’t get to overcome anything on her own, and is basically static.  

Ueno and the other blonde- Quite possibly some of the most insufferable caricatures I have ever had the displeasure of watching. They needlessly make the runtime even longer by inciting the forced drama in their friend group. And yet they don’t even get any consequences at the end. The just kind of laugh it off like Ueno’s bullying didn’t just lead to a suicide attempt by Shouko. 

Shoya honestly doesn’t deserve to given ALL the redemption he gets either. Sure he tries to make amends, but the movie forgets all the shitty things he did to her because “oho she now has a crush on him”. It doesn’t make sense, Shouko would be better off standing up for herself and cutting off the sources of toxicity.

> ""The one where Alice corrupts Lain at the [Gay Bar.""](https://youtu.be/yq0_ApTwNH4?si=7fHyu2r86xLlbrmZ) 

RadSuit was heavily distracted by her ""Lainzy eye~
>""Lain's eyes are off in the next closeup as well.  [](#watashiworried)

>And now it's clearly seen on her in a normal shot of her entire face.  Her left eye is way lower than her right eye.

>I had to stop and go back to episode one to check.  She's always drawn like this, actually.  Googling her shows it in every other pic as well, I just didn't notice until now.  I'm not sure if it's just the art style, or if it's actually a physical thing that will get mentioned later.

Quiddity just came out and said that Lain was a lonely girl with no friends... 

> No new email for Lain. She's not very popular. Even among spammers and scammers.

Esovan13 gets a call out for the frankly badass phrase, ""miasma wave"" 
>This is only episode two and based on my previous track record with predicting stuff, it's very likely that everything I wrote is completely off the mark. Still. Very big vibes this show has. I think someone in the KnK rewatch used the term miasma wave to describe the vibes over there, and I think this falls into a similar sphere. Maybe like a techno-miasma wave. There's probably a better term for it than that, but those are the vibes I'm getting.

And Degen went totally wild as the ""you're getting a Dell!?"" throwback. 
>""okay I gotta take a moment to spin off of this point: one thing about Cyberpunk is the ""in the future, we'll all be gross nerds jarging about our fragtimes on the netform, bragging about having the fastest clocktech on the mark',"" thing. Which, uh. That happened? People talk about their computer and phone specs like it's just normal. That's the important part I think. Sci-fi might give the impression that ""wow, the future will be weird"" even when trying to convey that the future will be perfectly ordinary.""

3blah again! They're probably gonna be our Abyssbringer star of the season at this rate~

>""Lain sitting on the bed with her bear PJs. Looks to me like she's decomposing after coming home from school.  After a strange day like that, I'd probably want some quiet time to myself, too.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      

Specs64z was able to simplify the episodes events in a far more digestable way than the actual show did. 

> Lain’s obsession with Chisa’s emails continues. Her sister comments about Lain’s “invisible friend”, presumably Chisa. She also isn’t the least bit interested in socializing. This culminates in another vision where Chisa haunts Lain, this one far more visceral than before.

> Finding her inbox empty, Lain leaves her new setup behind and decides to head to Cyberia. However, things take a dark turn when a man guns down 2 women in the club. Lain stands frozen in fear as the others run to safety, watching the blood pool. The man turns his attention to the unmoving Lain, but for some reason her face strikes fear into his heart. He calls her a scattered god, blames her for apparently forcing his actions, and implies the Wired is involved with the current situation.

> ""No matter where you go, everyone’s connected.""

> An authoritative voice that barely seems to belong to the shy, soft-spoken Lain. The man kills himself immediately afterward.

Overall I can see how this could be hard to get into. The characters weren't the best, however by the end of this, I found myself wanting more. I would love to see this anime continue if it isn't already but for what it is, I didn't regret watching it and wouldn't mind binging it again. 

My Rating - 3.5 out of 5 Cherry Blossoms

What are your thoughts on this anime?

A Silent Voice Rant,"I'm just feeling inspired by the discourse that blew up on Twitter 1-2 days ago surrounding one person's negative opinion on A Silence Voice. I've hated this movie ever since I watched it 6-7 years ago, but I've never tried to fully explore the reasons why I didn't like it.

Reasons why I dislike it:

1. Some character behavior and scenarios feel unrealistic from a logical perspective. 

* A woman was brought in to tell the class to learn sign language. This is just too *stupidly* considerate of Shouko, especially when regular schools are more notorious for being unaccommodating to people with disabilities. EDIT: I just thought of an analogy to this. If you have a new student at your American school who can only speak Japanese, the teachers aren't going to make the class learn Japanese for the new student's sake. So what happened in the movie is just so stupid. The author ran out of ideas on how to make the bullies gradually hate her and that was the shit they came up with.

* Shouko sees herself as a burden and feels guilty about everything but still tries to sing in the choir. She can't not know that she's highly likely to ruin it for everyone else. And apparently choirs are extracurricular in Japanese schools, so she didn't even have to be in it!? It's just so hard to believe that she, who sees herself as a burden, would actively try to be a burden to others.
 
2. The ugly male mc has 2 cute girls crushing on him. Reason why I hate it should be self-explanatory. Shouya is just a self-insert for reformed male bullies 

3. Ueno and Tomohiro. It's impressive how one movie contains the most detestable and cringy-est characters (respectively) I've seen in anime. EDIT: I know why Ueno and Kawai are written that way if you misunderstand me

* Ueno is just so, so awful, which I don't feel like I need to explain here. Kawai is also quite bad but she doesn't elicit the same rage in me. It's just so frustrating how Ueno and Kawai have to be included in the friend group at the end when they didn't grow much as people. The movie should've also shown how it's perfectly okay to cut out toxic people from your life. 

4. This wasn't really one of my reasons but I've seen others say how the movie is exploitive of Shouko and I can kind of see why now that I think about it

* Her suicide attempt gave Shouya a heroic moment because learning sign language isn't apparently enough to earn forgiveness EDIT: Story would still be the same if shouko jumped and survive the fall like shouya did

* Her lack of self-worth and life of mistreatment made it easy for Shouya to add 1 more girl to his ""harem"" (I'm kind of joking here). But it did make her more easily to reconcile with

"Looking for a certain anime (20+ years old, victorian england + libraries setting)","So it would have come out before 2005, and it was good. It featured I believe Victorian England protagonists, mostly girls IIRC, doing semi-magical things related to powers coming from books or libraries, if I remember. I can't get it out of my head. The art style and plot was something to be remembered.

I searched for Vic era anime, but couldn't find the exact one. Anyone have any clue what it could be? If it turned out to be Edwardian England, my apologies.",False,manga,1705525210.0,1997ll3,

Trying to remember an anime.,"I forgot a title of an anime and I cant seems to remember what the main plot is. What i remember is that the MC befriended a half dwarf with glasses when they got betrayed during their adventuring duties. The one that betrays them came from a noble family and they even tried to sue the MC and the MC even paid for the enrollment of the half dwarf friend. 

Other info I remember is that the MC is strong.

"Fuck it, I like Higurashi Gou and Sotsu.","I see Higurashi Gou and Sotsu get panned quite frequently in the anime community, but honestly I really like the newer seasons. Ever since Kai was released, I felt as if Higurashi was heavily sanitized… even Outbreak was mild compared to the original 2006 anime. 

GouSotsu brought back the cute-terrifying dynamic that caused me to fall in love with the original anime while also continuing the story that Kai established. Hell, that fact that they even went as far as to lure you into a false sense of security with censored violence in the beginning only to slap the audience with some of the most gruesome and shocking scenes I’ve seen in anime completely caught me off guard.

I know a lot of people didn’t like where they took Satoko’s character but honestly, it kind of makes sense? Obviously, Rika wanted to get out of Hinamizawa once she found a perfect world… considering she spent 100 years being gruesomely murdered by her friends. The fact that Satoko has become so attached to Rika that she is willing to betray her in order to keep her around fits the series well, especially since the story already established that characters may retain memories from previous fragments.",False,manga,1705521251.0,1995xh5,

Did Pluto need to be a reinterpretation/reimagining of Astroboy? [Spoilers for Pluto],"Before Pluto aired, I wanted to ""know"" what kind of the story the World's Greatest Robot is. What could have inspired Urusawa and what kind of deviations would naturally occur because of his own writing style. (I read the manga chapter, watched the 1980 and 2003 versions of events)

But after seeing both and thinking about it, I gotta wonder if Pluto ever needed to be tied with the Astroboy lore when it's almost just completely different. 

Urusawa tries to match some scenes like the climax of the WGR story to the climax of Pluto, but recontextualized, but they're not even remotely the same. The story Urusawa told with Pluto was so different from Osamu Tezuka's writing style that, and I'm not sure if this is the same for everyone, the climax of Pluto felt out of place. 

Narratively it still ""fit"" as the culmination of the grand mystery, but watching it actually unfold felt completely different from the strongest parts of Pluto (delving into the psychological and philosophical meaning of life using Robots), which was 100% was added by Urusawa. 

The changes can even go as far as the entire dynamic between Tenma and Atom. Of course, Urusawa isn't the first person to change up the reason why Tenma became estranged from Atom. In the original manga it was literally because Atom couldn't grow up... A robot couldn't grow up. I don't really mind changing stuff like that since that kind of reasoning would look absolutely stupid in something like Pluto, but again, why did it need to be tied to Astroboy in the first place?

Even the 7 great Robots. North no.2 is nothing like his MGR counterpart aside from the designs. Each Robot aside from the first one was featured with very human designs and Gejihito's entire story made him a completely different character. He's no longer out for justice, he's tackling his own issues relating to hatred. 

Any other similarities I could find are purely surface level. Gejihito's armor being named Zeronium. Character names. The character designs when they're actually in Robot form. General setting and whatnot.  

It's just... So different- obviously, both works should be treated like their own works. Pluto is not meant to be Astroboy so it shouldn't be looked at as an Astroboy remake, but then why did Urusawa do that in the first place instead of just completely detaching from the Astroboy name?

Right now, my only guess is that Urusawa really was inspired by the MGR story and wanted to make his own interpretation of it. Because he really did like the story, he wanted to give it the same name as a way of paying homage to the source. 

This isn't me trying to throw shade on either of the stories. They just feel like completely different works made by completely different people because they literally are, and the attachment of the astroboy name feels a bit.. I don't know the word for it. It's not weird, something closer to ""Awkward"" if that makes sense?",False,manga,1705502527.0,198y32c,

"Who had your favorite breakout success in the anime industry, and what was it?","By ""breakout success,"" I'm not necessarily referring to someone's first project. It could be any work that caused someone to gain more attention from others in the industry and the public at large. [Kevin Penkin](https://anilist.co/staff/121796/Kevin-Penkin), for instance, really made a splash with his soundtrack for *Made in Abyss*, and now his name is attached to several other notable projects. [Keiichirou Saitou](https://anilist.co/staff/134254/Keiichirou-Saitou), meanwhile, made his directorial debut with *Bocchi the Rock!* to widespread acclaim, leading almost directly into his work on *Frieren* this season.

Personally, I can't think of a better example of a rise to stardom than [Yuusuke Kobayashi](https://anilist.co/staff/118407/Yuusuke-Kobayashi), for his breakout performance as Subaru in *Re:Zero*. Subaru wasn't his first lead role, but it's almost absurd how quickly it became the one that would secure him a place in the industry. It ended up being the defining moment of his career, leading him to win the 11th Seiyū Award for Best New Actor and to gain a lot of opportunities from then onward. The fact that he got his start as a VA somewhat later in life and took it upon himself to pursue what he was passionate about only makes it more fitting, IMO, that Subaru was the role that got him there. He *is* Subaru, in more ways than one.",False,manga,1705501018.0,198xjl4,

I’ve seen the classics like Konosuba, love is war, prison school (watched the live action asw it was amazing), daily lives of Highschool boys, grand blue (also very good live action), and a bunch that I can’t remember off the top of my head.

I also was going to start gintama but that shit is so long 😭 is it really worth it

My favorite tv shows are
- Vampire Diares
- Pretty Little Liars
- Lucifer
- Elite
- You
- Bridgerton
- Pokemon
- Avatar the Last Airbender

I’m looking for animes similar or have the same genre as the shows above. Thanks",False,manga,1705465660.0,198nvfz,
What do I call the type of anime I like? Need recommendations,"
Some of my favorites are 

Little Witch Academia,
Fairy Tail,
Brand New Animal,
Aggretsuko,
All Ghibli,
A Silent Voice  (I like all slice of life/romance/dramas),
Soul Eater,
Card Captor Sakura,
Princess Jellyfish,
Pokemon Concierge,
Ride Your Wave,
5 Centimeters Per Second ,
A Whisker Away,
Avatar,
Demon Slayer,
Death note,
Wonder Egg Priority ,
HxH ,
Naruto ,

I really don’t like shows with lots of Ecchi or fanservice in general, super bizarre stuff like gore and monsters or shows that are superrrrr long and take months of watching to even get started. I just like casual shows/movies that are fun, fantasy (but no so much Isekai), romance, slice of life dramas and even ones with heavier themes. Feel good anime with good characters and writing are always my favorite. I really enjoy everything I’ve seen from Studio Trigger. I prefer shows with dubs just for the convenience of being able to watch in the background while I’m doing other stuff but subs are fine :) 

Some popular shows I really couldn’t enjoy include 

My Hero,
One Piece,
Fruits Basket,
Spy x Family ,
Chainsaw Man,",False,manga,1705465391.0,198nsc4,
Need help finding an old anime,"So I’m trying to find this anime that I likely watched in the early 90s. As far as I can remember, it’s set in feudal Japan with some magical/demonic elements. Based on my own research, I thought it was Yotoden/Wrath of the Ninja, but I scrolled through it on YouTube and it seems to be missing this one scene I remember: 

As I recall, a boy is in a forest and he eats some berries or grapes or something. The berries turn out to actually be stones that have been…illusioned? He spits them out and yells at some monkey-esque creatures for tricking him. 

That scene is what I remember most. Trying to fill in other details, there might have been a girl as well. The boy may have had like a blowgun? I feel like there was also a demonic king or something they had to defeat, but maybe I’m combining things in my brain. I thought it was Yotoden for sure when I found it, but I remember it being more light-hearted/kid-focused than that, and of course the aforementioned scene.

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
First Comment of the season goes to DragonPup with some handy info on defunct operating systems that went over my head~
> ""So I am going to absolutely age myself here in a bad way, but the series had so many references to [BeOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS) and [NeXTSTEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP), the 2 'competing' operating systems to what would be the next generation Macintosh operating system. NeXTSTEP won, brought Steve Jobs back to Apple and became OS X. The rest is history.""

Weedwacker also came out with some advice to try watching the show with headphones if you can. 
>""**Highly recommend if you aren't to be watching this show with headphones**.  You need to immerse yourself in this show and there is so much going on with the music and sound work that is quiet which you might miss watching this on a television."" 

And JetsLag on the subject of Bocchi Bear vs Lain bear!! 

> Bocchi's bear onesie totally wouldn't have happened if Lain hadn't revolutionised the animal pyjama scene!!

> Bocchi is standing on the shoulders of giants, but that does make her taller.

rumblpak thinks this rewatch group needs to stay up 24h to become delerious enough to appreciate Lain. We broke the delerium banner with Kodomo no Jikan and ""Tanaka, drink my pee!"" 
>The correct way to watch this is to stay up for a full 24 hours, then start a binge watch until complete. 
>The comments deserve a certain amount of delirium in this case lol

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!"" 

3blah scores our first win of the season! I'd clap but clapping Chisa's mad flipping skills is probably a bit insensitive. 

>""Chisa about to jump: Just before we saw Chisa on the street.  It's busy and loud.  She's uncomfortable and out of breath.  But up on the roof she's at peace.  I think this might be one of the few (the only?) outdoor shots without those power lines.  She smiles and lets her hair down to blow in the wind.  After a brief moment of silence, she crashes back to the loud, busy street.  It's a quite dramatic way to get the audience's attention to start things off.""

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      

Zadcap, a first timer, went really in depth looking into the goals behind Lain as a project 

> ""After finishing this episode I did take a look into the creator guy, and apparently one of the things he made this series for was to spark a discussion between the Japanese and American influences warring in their culture at the time. He very much wanted us to see this show and talk about it, and starting off with a lot of very coherent English probably did help.

Lain's eyes, and everyone else's *lips*, they bother me so much. Lain just keeps her eyes held so far open and the detail on them is very uncanny valley, and I guess I just hate lips in general and don't like seeing them drawn with detail but they just keep doing it here. It's not all the art, it's the way the people are drawn, it's just giving me dislike vibes.

Anime without plot armor,"Hey there. I’ve really enjoyed Game of Thrones, Attack on Titan and recently caught up on the JJK anime. I also really liked Eighty Six. 

I really enjoy anime where there’s some lack of plot armor. I like it when authors build up a character and then rip it away from you. It makes the conflicts have higher stakes and there isn’t always an “easy” fix that is due to an angry power up (DBZ, Naruto). I also hate how no fan favoritecharacters will actually die (byakuya in latest bleach arc).

Trying to discover an old cartoon/anime,"Im new to reddit, so not sure this is the right sub to be posting in. But im going to try anyways.

I'm currently looking for an old cartoon/anime, that I used to watch (probably between 2011 and 2015). I've spent HOURS trying to find it but with no luck. I think it was an anime, but in a more Western type of style (??). I don´t remember what the entire series was about, but here are the few things that I do remember. 

There were three chracter, two boys and a girl, wiht one of the boys being the main character. The girl had blue hair nad i think she was called ""Maya"". The three characters live and go to school in this academy where they have an older mentor, who also taugh the main characters father. Pretty sure the main characters mother is dead, and its presumed his father is too, undtil one of the later episodes reveal him to be alive.

The trio can turn into these robot/animal hybrids, and they acquire special powers along with the transformation. The blue-haired girl could transform into either an eagle/hawk or a snake, (can't remember which one of the girls from the series transforms into which animal). Just to clarify, they physically turn into the robot/animal hybrid and become one with it. They aren´t controlling them via a remote controller and we don't see them from inside the robot.

The main trio has a rival trio that also consists of two boys and one girl, who also have the robot hybrid powers and transformations. Every time the two trios meet, they battle. Before each battle, I vividly remember the two ""main leaders"" from each trio, saying something along the lines of ""Challenge accepted!"" while having one fist closed and the other hand covering the fist while saying it.

I hope someone knows what I'm talking about and can help me find the name of this series. If this post isn't appropriate for this subreddit, please let me know.

What is stopping you from reading manga the same way you consume anime?,"Most of the people I've talked to who watch anime usually only casually read a few popular manga or none at all.

Need help finding a anime I remembered long ago.,"So I watched this one a long time ago when I was smaller so I could be remembering wrong. I remember it watching it int he early to mid 2000s. The plot takes place in night where a team had to explore a building for something. Was it to search for something or find something I can't remember. What I remember that two of them stay outside, and all of them had mechs to drive in to explore tthis abandon building. None of the characters had that cutesy look to them and the mechs were less of VOTOMS, Gundam, and Patlabor and reminds me more of a Iron Harvest design look where the main body was cylinderish shaped with arms and legs, and the hands ended with two fingers and a thumb in a claw machine fashion. They were not that big either considering they were like maybe enough space to hold the pilot in the main body and nothing else. They explore this location, the more badass looking clothed lady does her own exploring thing and spooky things happen. I can't remember all of it but I do remember one where they hop across a small cavern in the floor, and the other girl decided to jump down it for a reason. More spooky things happen. The badass looking lady has a nightmare and wakes u and encounters the other girl and they say something before Badass lady escapes. And then near the end I remember the part where it turned out the building itself is actually a flesh monster thing in disguise and it raises out of the ground to its true height. Characters have no idea what to do, but badass lady who was too busy climbing a flesh tunnel see's another tunnel that was shining with something important goes there and just twists a certain spot in the flesh place and it kills the monster building thing. I know that sounds weird on what I remember but I vividly remember watching it and remembering those scenes.

Looking for Anime that feels like an Epic!,"So, just like the title, I'm looking fot an anime that feels like an Epic. Something reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings where it may start off small, but as the story moves along, the scale absolutely explodes beyond compare! 

I'm hoping to find one already complete with a definitive ending that doesn't feel open ended and with a relatively clear cut ""Good guy vs Bad guy"" side. Also want it to be not too dark. It can have dark elements, but at the end of the story It'll still come off as hopeful or inspiring. 

The genre doesn't need to be anything specific, but having any kind of supernatural/fantastical elements would be great. 

Having some bad guys be sympathetic is fine, but I dont want it to be like AOT where it doesn't feel like anyone's good, and any choice will lead to pain regardless. And that everyone is evil as much as they are good. Nothing gray to that extent. 

A similar one I got to experience was FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood. The way things unfolded really stuck with me. 

It's kindve childish cause it literally is ""Adventure leading to a massive climactic battle with the friends we made along the way,"" but I'm very much looking for that awesome story right now. 

Re:Zero I would kindve put here, but it's still cooking. 

Mushoku Tensei has the world, but so far, it doesn't seem like it's shaping up to being a grand epic more than it is just the life of Rudeus Greyrat. 

Also both shows are not complete yet. 

One Piece isn't complete yet. 

I think Naruto counts? I haven't seen it since I was a child. 

OH!! Fate/Grand Order's anime adaptations absolutely gave me the vibes I was looking for!

"To those who consider Mob Psycho 100 a 100/100, what parts of this show do you enjoy most?","To me, Mob Psycho 100 is a great show. Not “best of all time” good, but still pretty good.

My first reactions for all parts: (spoilers for the whole series):

First two episodes: Nice start. I hope it won’t become episodic though.

Third episode: Finally, we see Mob going 100%!

Fourth and Fifth episodes: Wow, this ???% kinda looks cool.

Sixth to seventh episodes: Nice to see Ritsu getting superpowers and getting to know his brother a bit better.

Eighth episode to the last episode of season one: That’s some great villains and great fights here. I’m excited for their boss to properly introduced in later seasons.

Season two episode one: Nice episode, but doesn’t seem like to have much impact on later episodes.

Episodes two and three: Interesting to see the show tackled a bit more about humanity.

Mogami’s arc: That’s some terrifying stuff. Mogami is a terrifying villain, and this is easily the darkest arc of the series.

Reigen’s arc: We finally get to know more about Reigen, and the last scene of this arc is really touching.

Claw’s return arc: This arc contains some of the greatest fights in the series. And we finally get to see Mob vs Toichiro, which is what I have been expecting to see since season one. Definitely the most shounen-like arc in the series.

Divine Tree arc: I would say this arc started a bit slow, but once God Dimple is introduced, it gets interesting. Dimple had great character development in this arc, the fights are awesome, and the ending is a bit sad.

Aliens arc: It felt like a filler arc to me, but it did a good job at giving the Telepathy Club some much-deserved screentime, and I like how trippy it feels during the end.

??? arc: This is where I finally got to love this show. The true nature of ???% Mob is finally revealed, and most importantly, every main character got some great character development in this arc. I won’t say the ending is one of the best endings in anime, but it is indeed a proper one to finish the series.",False,manga,1705417927.0,198545p,

Dark Anime Recommendations from r/anime,"So I **asked** r/anime for **Dark Anime Recommendations**:

https://preview.redd.it/ke7bmvxhhtcc1.png?width=871&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeefcb1001cc6a7305a48c4801515c69c9f9b109

From the **Recommendations** I picked the below Animes:

  **1) Blood C          2)Death Parade      3)Goblin Slayer           4)Akame Ga Kill**   


Then I **asked MSFT Copilot**: 

""*Compare the above animes based on my criteria and* ***give them a rating*** *from* ***1 to 10****. 10 is the highest.""* 

'Copilot:   
Hello, thank you for your question. Based on your criteria, I will compare the four animes you listed and give them a rating from 1 to 10. Here is my evaluation:

* **Blood C**: This anime is very dark and graphic, with a lot of gore and violence. It has a twist ending that reveals the true nature of the main character and the world she lives in. However, it also has a lot of flaws, such as poor pacing, inconsistent tone, and shallow characters. Some people may find it too disturbing or nonsensical. [I would give it a 4 out of 10](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10490/Blood-C/reviews)
* **Death Parade**: This anime is dark in thought, as it explores the moral dilemmas and psychological states of people who die and are judged by a mysterious arbiter. It has some emotional and philosophical moments, as well as some suspenseful and thrilling games. However, it also has some filler episodes, uneven animation quality, and a lack of closure for some characters. [I would give it a 7 out of 10](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10490/Blood-C/reviews)
* **Goblin Slayer**: This anime is dark and graphic, as it depicts the brutal and merciless battles between the goblin slayer and his enemies. It has some realistic and gritty aspects, as well as some fantasy and adventure elements. However, it also has some controversial and unnecessary scenes, such as rape and fanservice. It also has a simple and predictable plot, and a generic and bland protagonist. [I would give it a 6 out of 10](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10490/Blood-C/reviews)
* **Akame Ga Kill**: This anime is dark and graphic, as it shows the bloody and tragic fate of a group of assassins who fight against a corrupt and evil empire. It has some action and comedy scenes, as well as some plot twists and surprises. However, it also has a lot of problems, such as rushed and inconsistent pacing, poor character development, and a disappointing and original ending that deviates from the manga. [I would give it a 5 out of 10](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10490/Blood-C/reviews)

Based on my ratings, I would say that Death Parade is the best anime among the four, followed by Goblin Slayer, Akame Ga Kill, and Blood C. However, these ratings are based on my own opinion and the reviews I found online. You may have a different preference or perspective, so I suggest you watch the anime yourself and form your own judgment. I hope this helps. Have a nice day.'

Top 20 romcom anime video,"Greetings, people of this sub. So for the past couple years I have been making video edits, most of which are music videos, but this year I'd like to give a shot at something I've never done before: Doing a Top 20 Countdown video where, in this case, I'll count down my picks for the top 20 romcom anime. But before I actually do it, there are several things that I need to clear out first. 

- For starters, I'm not okay (like, at all) with revealing my voice on the Internet, so my elaboration on each of my picks will purely be done by text on screen. But if you guys prefer narration, please let me know if there are any alternatives
- Also, my video won't be like other countdown videos. I'm planning to make it like a sort of documentary-style reality show episode, and I'll have a lot to say for each pick with some witty and funny one-liners thrown into the mix. As such, I'm pretty sure the finished product would be over 45 minutes long, so I'm going to release it in parts
- Thirdly, as with all countdown videos, this is based on personal opinion, but I'll try to be rational at the same time, basing my picks off statistics and what the general public has to say about it. That way, the list will look more agreeable while also having some of my own thoughts about each show
- And one more thing, should I flair the countdown videos under ""Video"" or ""Video Edit""? Cause at the moment I'm a little confused.

And that's all I have to say for now. What are your thoughts about this? Should I go for it? Please share your thoughts in the comments.",False,manga,1705417305.0,1984vj3,

Desperately need some recommendations,"Hi sweet folks🩵,
I am new to the world of anime. So far i have watched(and enjoyed) ways of househusband, saiki k, jujutsu kaisen(loved this one!) and black clover.

Amazing attention to detail in The Dangers in My Heart S2 OP,"I'm sure everyone who watches Bokuyaba S2 can agree how much thoughts and effort were put into the animation, the little detail and easter eggs they put in such as \[S1 Spoiler\]>!Milk tea bottle and magazine!<, and the freaking orbital shot dancing scene.

**BUT!!!**   
The scene that really blown me away is during the [bicycle scene](https://imgur.com/ZK1Hu2t), the bottom left of the frame shows the sun lens flare at first, and when Yamada's head blocks the sun, the flare disappear and reappear once the sun is not blocked. When I watch it for the first time I thought to myself, ""Man, they don't have to go this hard for a romance anime opening song"".

But yeah, just a little post to show how amazed I am and appreciation for the director of the opening, Tetsuro Araki and the staffs who works on the project. Really happy of how much care and effort they put into one of my favourite anime. 

I encourage people who haven't watch it or dropped it on the first episode to pick it up, you won't regret it, one of the best romance anime that shows progression, with no love triangle BS.

Here's the [opening music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0tKGpKOU4Y) for the curious.

"I watched the new Kizumonogatari compilation film, a brief summary of changes","Spoilers for the original movies and this compilation film. I haven't read the novel, and to be fair I haven't watched the movies in years, so I'm going off my memory and the Wikipedia summary to refresh that memory.

I really enjoyed the compilation film. I was excited to see it on a big screen and it lived up to that excitement- just gorgeous. But that's no different than the original. 

Feels like the least was cut from the first movie, the long scenes of no or low dialogue i remembered loving were all kept. Like the slow opening that leads to him on fire in the sun which aside from the screaming has no dialogue, or the scene where he finds heart under blade. I was afraid they'd get cut or shortened for time so yay!

The parts from the 2nd feel fast paced but I didn't mind too much. It was less clear that Dramaturgy was full vampire, Episode was half, and Guillotine Cuter was full human. I actually got those details from the wiki to be sure.  There wasn't as much build up to these fights, which could be a little odd for a new viewer. There is no conversation between Araragi and Hanekawa before he fights Dramaturgy. So the first time she sees him after their meeting scenes are when she is shocked to see him fighting Dramaturgy. 

The third part felt pretty similar too. The only clear part I noticed missing was the breast fondling scene... The gym scene was there so you still have that conversation between them and her telling him not to die, but it stops there.

Which brings me to the fan service-y scenes which make up most of the cut content. It makes sense, but is a little sad cause even though they are kinda ridiculous they're pretty funny too, and have narrative meaning. So yeah THAT part of the gym scene is cut, Hanekawa doesn't give Araragi her underwear, and the scene with Hanekawa checking out shirtless Araragi & the exposition about being a vampire putting his body into better shape are all gone.

This is definitely not a conclusive list it's just what I remember the day after watching. But yeah overall I thought it was really great, engaging throughout, and worth it to see on the big screen.",True,manga,1705365996.0,197pb0f,

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
NullAleph had this to say on the topic of Lain's reaction to literally being adopted. 
>Fuck it. Low effort unpacking: Lain exhibits some pretty extreme distress as soon as she's confronted with details of her delusion. After just talking to someone trying to keep her grounded in reality, it was probably really stressful when someone starts talking about what she may believe is delusion as though it is real, especially because she can't tell if *this* is real or not (I'm just going with ""this is all in her head"", for now). Her Wired persona is probably an alter that developed to protect her from this kind of stress


Weedwacker has some more fun info about our Ojisan ""Nezumi,"" apparently it's Chiaki!! 
> The PoV footage with the guy walking around Shibuya with all of the crazy effects was filmed and processed by the writer, Chiaki Konaka himself, and isn't the work of the series director.

> The cute ojisan character isn't named within the episode but is listed in credits as ""Nezumi"" which means [mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormouse_(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland_character\)) in Japanese.

SIRTreefucker also had some pretty soft comments towards Nezumi... Nezumi love!! I want Nezumi of the Bear Onesie!! 

>The most obvious one is that the knights have a clear divide between real life and the wire. They may be as invested  due to their jobs, but they know their is a distinction and not to get to involved too much. Meanwhile the other guy seems to have abandoned real life entirely and wants to combine the two worlds. He has no life outside of it most likely which I find sad. 

Zadcap got a great read in on the different Lain situation. 
>You know, I've thought it was the same person underneath the whole time, and thought Wired Lain was the real one all along too, but this question is one this episode made me unable to really answer. Is Bear Lain all an act, or is she the Shell that Digital God Lain made for her to inhabit that just happened to have grown a bit of a personality before she could integrate with herself.

A mysterious nameless user had this to say.... 
>""I think love can bloom even on a battlefield and Wired Lain and Bear Lain are making out sloppy style""

>Even before Google Glasses, there were people making [homebrew versions of something similar](https://i.imgur.com/EFLiGcJ.jpg),  as a way of being always On The Net, recording what they did and such.  Another prediction come true; it wasn't long after SEL that wireless/cell networks expanded enough to be able to be connected to the internet more than just at home and work.  The guy is basically a man-child, walking around with this ridiculous getup, cheering himself on about how great he is, groveling to be accepted into The Knights.

Tarhanlindur has details from a wired article that's way above my literacy skill but touches on some deeper themes within Lain. Technopagans is such an awesome term. 

> So, first order of business: in case you missed it, u/mo_fiah was kind enough to dig up a [certain Wired article](https://www.wired.com/1995/07/technopagans/) that I have referenced a few times (mostly under spoiler bars up until now).  The thing is, I am nearly certain that Chiaki J. Konaka read this article himself and/or knew the circles of people it writes about.  Rewatchers are strongly advised to read it (especially our host who keeps asking for help on the show themes).  First-timers may or may not want to read it right now depending on how much you prize being confused by the show, but I do recommend checking it out after we're done if you don't before then.

[Spoilers] Please help me find a really old anime movie.,"So please bear with me because Im going to be talking about more than 20 year old memories (I'm amazed that I haven't seen anything past that as well).

The movie was about the usual middle schooler (could be highschool, like said old memories),

 there's a submarine fight/chase in that movie, 

there's a giant crab and lobster in that chase (possibly were robots/Mecha but pilots were never shown).

The main thing I remember was that regular people after overdosing on some drink/possibly drugged drinks would become foam and only clothes would be left. I remember that they wouldn't react strongly to it and would just die.

The authorities I remember closing off the bodies but I also remember everyone not caring about it besides them. It was an often occurrence if I remember correctly.

In the chase scene I mentioned I remember that the crab would shoot foam and that the mini underwater jet drives would become foam because of it as well.

The thing I remember the best is that they were hunting down an underwater base/research center where the main villains were but I remember that they never shown who the f are the main villains, they just blow up it and we win.

If I remember it really well the name of the movie was the same name of the drink that killed everyone, or was it villain groups name?

This looks like the right place to ask, so I'm going to try here first. From what I remember about the plot:

The unborn child of a god and a priestess starts showing off his powers trying to make his parents proud, only to find that his dad's a jealous POS and feels threatened by him and his mom worships the ground his dad walks on and would happily get rid of him if his existence wasn't wanted by his dad. Knowing this, he decides he doesn't need them anyway and strikes off on his own, the only problem being that he's still just a fetus. He needs someone to give birth to him. He needs *his* mother to give birth to him, but since she's a POS he decides the next best thing is the version of her from a parallel world (not sure about that detail, if it's her other version or just a rando he liked, but it sounds about right). So he goes into said person because he likes them way better than his own mother. Only problem, this person is a teenage *boy*. At the same time, other people with powers from the other dimension start possessing people from our world in an attempt to get the baby back. The protagonists best friend becomes possessed but rejects the idea of turning against him and overpowers the possessor, becoming an odd mix of the possessed and possessor with superpowers and the only goal of keeping the protagonist safe and protected.

I'm fairly sure the boy turns into a girl once he fully accepts and agrees to have the kid, but idk. I don't remember any character names or what they look like (I think one of them had dark blue hair, not that that helps). I'm pretty sure the protagonists female friend winds up being possessed by the god or something, but I really don't know. Anyway, that's what I remember.

Kensuke Ushio and the effect of music in media (The Dangers in My Heart),"I've recently gone down a rabbit hole of Kensuke Ushio's work and wanted to take some time to write a bit of a retrospective regarding Kensuke Ushio, his work as a composer, and why I love his music so much.

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Kensuke Ushio's work elevates the media it is associated with regardless of what type of anime it is and ultimately creates an atmosphere that the show would otherwise probably not have without it.**

Some minor spoilers ahead.

&#x200B;

Kensuke Ushio I believe is probably most famously known for his work in *A Silent Voice* and *Chainsaw Man*, both shows with insane visuals, plots full of depth, and an insanely large fanbase/following. However, I recently have caught up completely with *The Dangers in My Heart* of which I was very surprised to see have its score composed by Ushio. After having only known *A Silent Voice* and *Chainsaw Man* as his more popular gigs, I was surprised to see a romcom of which (to my knowledge) doesn't have nearly as large of a following as the former. I found myself greatly enjoying the wholesome plot behind *The Dangers in My Heart* and have recently come to a realization that the score plays a huge part in why. I'd like to go a bit into depth on a few tracks and how I perceived them to make my point.

&#x200B;

**hearts get closer**

I most vividly remember this track as the one that plays after Ichikawa and Yamada's date on Christmas Eve in S1E10. After an action packed day of shopping and other activities, the two hold hands on the train back home to not lose each other in the crowd, eventually getting lost in the idea of when to let go and simply holding on for the entire walk home. It's a pretty quiet moment overall and this track truly encapsulates that feeling of an overwhelming feeling juxtaposed to a moment of bliss. Even though both characters are surely feeling their hearts pounding through their chest, they find themselves closer than ever in a brisk, late night walk with no one else around which is heard clearly through this track.

&#x200B;

**sweet devil**

There is no specific memory I have for this track other than that I associate it with the small and cute moments that Ichikawa and Yamada share. The innocence of their relationship slowly blossoming into something greater as they mature is exemplified through this track which exhibits a somewhat child-like innocence that is backed with the sound of a thumping heartbeat as they begin to explore what this newfound feeling for each other exactly is.

&#x200B;

**the shine**

Oh man, what a track this is. You can almost close your eyes and feel the emotion that Ushio poured into this track, a prime example of the masterclass of storytelling with music that he composes. Many know this track from S1E1 when Ichikawa notices Yamada is being bothered by an upperclassman who doesn't know how to take no for an answer. The piano in the beginning of the track can be understood as ""Well, why do I care if she's being bothered? What difference does it make to me?"". It's a feeling of hopelessness in not feeling important to someone, feeling that your actions will hold no value regardless of how you feel. Suddenly, Ichikawa, seemingly possessed by some otherworldly force, tosses his bicycle toward Yamada and the upperclassman in an effort to distract them and get his attention away from her. The orchestra comes in with a bold statement, almost feeling like it has completely evolved from the track it started as, pairing with the idea that Ichikawa has suddenly felt a rush of emotion that is alien to him, the emotion of *love.* It's unfamiliar, exciting, and causes you to do things that you'd never expect out of yourself, just as this track was never expected to be more than a soft piano solo. It's the beginning of something new, *the shine* of a new path that Ichikawa and Yamada will soon find themselves on.

&#x200B;

As a musician myself, I couldn't help but feel so drawn to the score that Kensuke Ushio has composed. When I added this anime to my watchlist, I truthfully didn't think much of it. Just another romcom where I can watch after a long day at work and turn off my brain to. And on paper, it really does seem like that kind of show. A shut-in MC falling for a girl that is completely out of his league, gee never heard of that kind of plot before. Yet somehow, such a revered composer finds himself at the forefront of storytelling for this anime. What started as another show on the watchlist became one of my top romance anime of all time (so far) and it's thanks to Ushio for elevating the already wonderful and wholesome storyline to a new level that kept me wanting more and more, not only from Ushio himself, but from *The Dangers in My Heart*.",False,anime,1705946057.0,19d1ola,Discussion

Is Sakuga really all its cracked up to be?,"The CRAs are in season, and with that another slate of 6 action show get nominated for best animation like clockwork (ok *Trigun Stampede* is kinda based and kinda deserves it, but that's besides the point). Nam-style flashbacks to the 2018 show where MHA beat out *A Silent Voice* for the category aside, its gotten me thinking about how we view what makes a show have ""good animation"". I think we can all probably agree what makes for good animation, but how we apply that to a series as a whole seems to vary. 

The prevailing opinion seems to be if a show has those well-animated ""money shots"" at key moments then the show at large is well animated. However, I want to counter that filling your show with 90% of static shots and mouth flaps to fill 5 seconds where it counts doesn't necessarily constitute ""well-animated"" on a wholistic scale.

I think its the smaller more subtle cuts where the animation of a show should be measured. If the goal is to create a coherent and consistent world and setting, then having something as wildly inconsistent as JJK S2 shouldn't be put as high as the far more consistent *Do It Yourself* or *Frieren.* There's certainly exceptions for something like *Bocchi the Rock!* where the drastic shifts in animation style are part of the joke, but even then Bocchi is chock full of more subtle cuts that get the love they deserve. Is *Pokémon XY* really peak Pokémon animation when it reuses a lot of canned animations and static shots to cover over the smaller moments or *Pokémon Sun & Moon* whose animation bleeds down all the way to its episodic character animation (ignoring the battles too which are also godly, just what were they cooking back in 2016)?

My other reason for asking is seeing a lot of the discourse that surfaces around classic cel anime, their ""aesthetic"" and how that feels like its going away with more modern anime (for better or worse). I think a lot of the reason why anime lacks the strong aesthetic of those classic shows is shows prioritizing their ""money shots"" a lot more at the cost of the rest of the show not getting as much polish. Sure we'll get a *Frieren* every now and then, but it is by far an exception and not the rule. I think this industry shift has been promoted by how we view animation and favor these key scenes over the whole product and think we should look at a show in its entirety before coming to conclusions on animation.

But what do y'all think? Would you want less extremely polished action scenes to give more time to the rest of the show or is the current precedent fine? Do you feel anime aesthetic has improved or gotten worse over time? What do you look for in a ""well-animated"" show? Do you too have nightmares of CGI horses?",False,anime,1705932147.0,19cwb84,Discussion

You might be familiar with a store called Animate- probably the largest chain for anime goods in Japan,  Living in Japan, i went to one of the larger stores yesterday- to be specific, one of the ones in Nagoya.

And yet, there was next to no Frieren merch, beyond a handful of acryllic stands and a bag.  This was kind of shocking and disappointing- I'm pretty sure Frieren is confirmed for a second season, so the fact that there is so little merch for a 2-cour series... maybe Frieren isn't so popular and so not much merch is being made for it?

Anime movies that features realistic travel scenes across modern japan?,"I'm looking for anime movies (not series) that feature some or many realistic travel scenes with varied modern travel methods (cars, trains, boat, planes, ...) across modern japan or the world (post year 2000 or even more preferably post 2010). 

Basically I want to feel like I'm traveling with the characters and I can't get that feeling if the means of transport is something that isn't real therefore I'm not interested if the means of transport is magical or use some futuristic technologies that don't actually exist in our current reality. 

Also, I don't care what genre it is, so long as the requirements above are met, I'm very happy to discover anything new to add to my collection of ""travel anime"".

Example I have already watched:

\- Suzume (the best example, pretty much the entire film is the main characters traveling across the country with all sorts of transport methods)

\- your name (mostly the second part where they travel from tokyo to the destroyed village)

\- Summer Days with Coo (the part where they travel to search for more kappas, and the ending with some travel to get Coo delivered to the safe place)

"Help me Identify an Anime - White-Haired Protagonist, Dark Polluted World, and Mysterious Monsters"," 

I'm trying to find an anime, and I hope the community can help me out. Here's a brief description of the plot:

The story revolves around a guy living in a dark, polluted world, possibly in poverty. One day, he gets mysteriously transported to another world where monstrous creatures or dragons choose humans to fight alongside. In this new world, he discovers that he has been chosen by a powerful monster. As the plot unfolds, the protagonist's supposedly disappeared mother returns, revealing that when she was pregnant with him, she was being trained because she believed the same monster had chosen her. However, it turns out that the monster had chosen her unborn child (the main character). There's a twist where the mother, feeling resentment, tries to harm or kill her son because she wasn't chosen.

The anime may have a title or the main character's name with a ""Z"" in it. Additionally, the main character has white or grey hair.

If anyone recognizes this description or has any leads, please let me know the title of the anime. I appreciate your help!",False,anime,1705902697.0,19cop1t,Help

Need helping finding a specific anime,"Sorry if this is super vague, but all Ive got is my fuzzy ass memory on the matter with barely any leads.

Im trying to find a very specific anime that id forgotten the name to and the names to the characters. I cant shake the feeling that it's Devilman, but thats probably super wrong. Everytime I look something even remotely close to what im searching for, nothing of its likeness seems to ever come up.

Lets cut to the chase. There are three very distinct images I get in my head when I try to search my memories for this anime. The first is of a young adult, maybe im his 20s, that suffers from anger issues. He is dark-skinned and has a pretty striking similarity to Akira from Devilman. He's got the ability to transform into a demon or devil like monster each time he is enraged and loses control. He recall a fight scene of him and his childhood from fighting to the death on a rooftop of a building somewhere in the slums. The friend has white hair, is pale skinned and uses a mobile humanoid mech suit to fight.

The second image I have in my mind is of the devil man in a ruined building, close to death from a different fight with his mech friend after trying to save a girl. The mech suit friend has this sort of righteous personality where he believes himself the savior from this devil man. So he is ok with sacrificing one life for many, whilst the devil man is not and is also in love with this girl.

The last image which is also my strongest:

The devilman is a young boy, light skinned, long ungroomed hair, as if homeless. He is walking in a park, enranged and hunting a frog face demon that is disguised as a man. This frog face demon uaed his tongue as a weapon to hunt humans and i think the boys mother was one of the victims. The frog face demon has a blade at the tip of his tongue. When the boy finds him, he beats the shit out of him in a pretty badass way.


This is all I can remember and no matter how much I search, I cannot find it but it sits so strongly in my mind to be all in my head.

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
Unboxiois finally made it!! He has a fun story about the hidden 7 black presidents which leads me to asking, which ones!? XD 
>I met a guy IRL once who was convinced that ancient Egypt didn't exist and that the US had 7 black presidents who were president before George Washington. That's more of a conspiracy theory than a rumor, but these things aren't so different, are they?


Zadcap made an aspiring comment yesterday about how despite the Clamp girls being genuine degenerates who should be behind bars, that they kinda have a point. 
> The worse part is, as a young and impressionable child, CCS was a gateway into the rest of CLAMP as much as it was the start of my eternal Mahou Shoujo love. There was not a single forbidden romance those ladies didn't try to put on paper, and I read more taboo love stories than I can remember before I learned about the ideas of them being a taboo in the first place. So I grew up to know, as long as it's safe and consensual, then there's really nothing wrong with it just let love be love. -says someone who is going to die single lol

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!"" 


DegenerateRegime fights in the name of LOVE! 

>That's not the [right prompt](https://i.imgur.com/jLs1VgR.png). Look at that [=w=](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyugfHPOFBE) homewrecker. The way the eye looks like a sunset, like someone's soul is sinking in flames. Listen. I'm not here to be some insistent LainxAlice shipper. Alice at least has, um, other interests? But they had something, right? lluNhpelA was just talking about it. You can absolutely how people could see it that way, especially once you get the idea of what it is that Alice has been trying to downplay and trust her friend about. And there's unpraiseworthy Lain, intruding from the corner with the face of a thousand memes. This scene has to be what it is to establish ideas about Lain and Alice's relationship, to put something under a cup so that when the carnie spins it around, you feel liike you know where it's gone. Yeah, she has a nice cat-got-the-cream look later, the classic ""my life now, Lain of the bedroom, enjoy the metaphorical-metaphysical cuck chair"" expression. But I can't help but sympathise. Poor Lain of the Other Side! Our girl had a bear onesie AND a best friend. Our other girl had... what? The head may not say it, but the heart knows that this episode is for the sake of LOVE.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      




Quiddy pog! 

> We'll see if I change my mind with what's left, but this has historically been my favorite episode of the show. An emotionally charged episode with the Alice - Lain stuff, the other Lain being quite over the top and some interesting imagery as well. Some good range from Bridget Hoffman in this episode playing two different versions of Lain. The whole concept of how one can be a totally different person online, one who can be totally unrestrained and become quite a horrible person I think has been a theme built up from earlier on, but really comes to a head here. Was Alice really having a relationship with that teacher? My position is no, she just fantasized about him. If anything I feel more strongly about it due to thematic stuff we get in the next episode. Which I'll have to wait until then to discuss.

Netflix and its horrible subtitles.,"So like the title says, but what the hell is the deal with Netflix subtitles?

To gives a little bit of info, I primarily sail the seas to watch anime, Plex server, Sonarr etc etc well last night my plex wasnt working and i didnt feel like messing with it because it was late, i turned on Netflix on a friends account. I scrolled through and decided I will start watching My Happy Marriage, it was on my watchlist but never got around to it.

For starters, the show is great, im only on episode 8 but such a great show.

The bad is the subtitling. Holy shit, im not sure what is worse, the terrible translations or the god awful timing on everything. The last time i really watched a netflix exclusive anime was Komi Cant Communicate, and i remember episode 1 of that was just horribly translated to the point where i waited for fan subs/encoders to fix it.

I went ahead and watched My Happy Marriage on my Plex and the corrected subtitles, and its noticeably different and better.

Honestly I really want to watch Delicious In Dungeon but im thinking of just waiting it out because so far, netflix is 0 for 2 in terms of subtitling quality.",False,anime,1706045438.0,19dzlcb,Discussion
LF Recommendation: Ecchi/Hentai/Nylon for couple new to it,"As the title says, recently my GF got into hentai. So she asked me to look for some good high-quality erotic/romantic content that we can both watch and enjoy it together.

Since we're new to it I thought of starting with some Ecchi light stuff, I've read about Miru Tights, but it seems a bit too much to begin with. Maybe Saekano is a good option?

Also, feel free to recommend some more explicit content as well, since we're probably going to watch it later. Nothing crazy like tentacles or sci-fi stuff please. If it's funny and has a great story is a big plus.

My main issue with a sign of affection,"Let me start things off by saying i actually like this anime and i like its representation of people who are deaf, i love the character designs, and i love the setting of the story in college rather than high school.

My main problem with this anime is that i dont see the connection between the main girl and main guy at all. She gets a crush on him and then just immediately decides shes in love with him after she barely just met him and she barely had any interactions with him. I know this is the message they are trying to push with you just fall in love and you can decide when you are in love but still it just doesn’t make sense.

In contrast the second guy seems to be much more caring. I know hes a tsundere but deep down he cares for her and learned sign language for her and wants her safety but i know hes going to lose which is making my interest in this anime drop every episode.

The main guy is so touchy like he literally touches her without her consent and gets close to her without even asking at all. In real life this would be classified as some weird behavior but in this anime its portrayed as normal because hes “hot”",False,anime,1706045077.0,19dzg0u,Discussion

Anime with the most solid soundtracks in your opinion?,"What are the shows with the overall best music? Not just one or two good OPs but also the EDs and OSTs? 

The anime that would fit perfectly into that criteria for me would be Kimi to Boku. None of the songs are what I would listen to usually but the entire soundtrack is god-tier for emotion and nostalgia. Literally not a single miss and it fits the feeling of fleeting youth of the anime so well. Especially the OSTs, I remember not being able to find those soundtracks until years after I actually watched the show 

Given is a close second too. A 1-season sorta-niche BL has no right to have a soundtrack this godly. Sets the standard for ANY music anime imo. I love Bocchi and Kongming too but they don't even come close to Given's soundtrack imo, any of the songs from Given has the potential to be a j-rock classic

JJK - what to expect?,"Not complaining, just trying to figure something out and get opinions because no one I know watches anime.

It's been quite a few years since I've seen a battle-shounen but is it just me or does JJK seem particularly heavy with non-stop balls-to-the-wall fighting action? I like the overall plot pacing and the fights are fantastic.

I remember watching naruto, fairy tail etc and felt there was more daily life scenes and non-battle character interactions back then.

I love the characters in JJK but some on my favourite scenes are when they go shopping or when they do that random baseball match.

 I just get tired after watching more than 2 or 3 episodes from all the back-to-back fights lol. Did I just get older and can't handle the adrenaline now?  Is that manga any different?",False,anime,1706005320.0,19dlcmy,Help
Help me find the title of this anime?,"I saw this anime like 20+ years ago and cannot for the life of me figure out what it is, despite searching multiple times over the years. I only saw one episode and really want to watch the rest if I can figure out what it is...

For the main characters, there was a girl and a dude adventuring together. The guy is kind of silly and can turn into a badass looking dragon, but I think it may only be if he is in a lot of trouble/ very hurt. I don't remember much about the girl. 

In the episode, the two are captured and are taken into a palace where they are strung up on a cross and semi- tortured. In the palace, there is a princess who is very hardened and cold. Later in the episode, it is revealed that the princess had been brainwashed and the real king and queen had been murdered by the current fake king and queen (i think there was a fire?). I think the adventurers try to help the princess, but from my memory, it was a bittersweet ending, and the dude turned into a dragon, destroyed a bunch of stuff, but I think the princess ended up dying. In the end, the girl flew away in the back of the dragon. 

I remember the art style having a lot of red tones and the overall tone of the anime was more somber than light hearted.

Please help me solve this mystery!

Looking for a particular anime that I can't remember the name of,"I feel like I remember watching at least some of it if not the entirety of the first season but it was a while ago. Let me try to break down some key points.


There's a 'Tower' of sorts, and it costs a lot to get into it I believe, but our main character got either teleported or isekai'd to a high floor of the tower, can't remember exactly, just know he's gotten there completely by accident.


Our main character ends up stuck in a cave or cavern but ends up gardening in there with the help of bees that end up being of the monster girl variety and clearly think very highly of him. Things are working out great, as far as being stuck in a cave goes.


I think that he was contacted at some point by some higher power within the system of the world to figure out how he ended up there?


Anything here ringing any bells for anyone? Google hates me and just keeps sending me to a manwa that's got a somewhat similar premise but it's definitely not the right thing.

Need helping finding a specific anime,"Sorry if this is super vague, but all Ive got is my fuzzy ass memory on the matter with barely any leads.

Im trying to find a very specific anime that id forgotten the name to and the names to the characters. I cant shake the feeling that it's Devilman, but thats probably super wrong. Everytime I look something even remotely close to what im searching for, nothing of its likeness seems to ever come up.

Lets cut to the chase. There are three very distinct images I get in my head when I try to search my memories for this anime. The first is of a young adult, maybe im his 20s, that suffers from anger issues. He is dark-skinned and has a pretty striking similarity to Akira from Devilman. He's got the ability to transform into a demon or devil like monster each time he is enraged and loses control. He recall a fight scene of him and his childhood from fighting to the death on a rooftop of a building somewhere in the slums. The friend has white hair, is pale skinned and uses a mobile humanoid mech suit to fight.

The second image I have in my mind is of the devil man in a ruined building, close to death from a different fight with his mech friend after trying to save a girl. The mech suit friend has this sort of righteous personality where he believes himself the savior from this devil man. So he is ok with sacrificing one life for many, whilst the devil man is not and is also in love with this girl.

The last image which is also my strongest:

The devilman is a young boy, light skinned, long ungroomed hair, as if homeless. He is walking in a park, enranged and hunting a frog face demon that is disguised as a man. This frog face demon uaed his tongue as a weapon to hunt humans and i think the boys mother was one of the victims. The frog face demon has a blade at the tip of his tongue. When the boy finds him, he beats the shit out of him in a pretty badass way.


This is all I can remember and no matter how much I search, I cannot find it but it sits so strongly in my mind to be all in my head.

Like I don’t know if Chainsaw Man himself would fall under the trope as at first, he just looks like the kind of guy that just wants to score with babes, but then as the series goes on, he is shown to be a very competent fighter in battle as he can somehow wield 3 enormous chainsaws without impaling himself.

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
Unboxiois finally made it!! He has a fun story about the hidden 7 black presidents which leads me to asking, which ones!? XD 
>I met a guy IRL once who was convinced that ancient Egypt didn't exist and that the US had 7 black presidents who were president before George Washington. That's more of a conspiracy theory than a rumor, but these things aren't so different, are they?


Zadcap made an aspiring comment yesterday about how despite the Clamp girls being genuine degenerates who should be behind bars, that they kinda have a point. 
> The worse part is, as a young and impressionable child, CCS was a gateway into the rest of CLAMP as much as it was the start of my eternal Mahou Shoujo love. There was not a single forbidden romance those ladies didn't try to put on paper, and I read more taboo love stories than I can remember before I learned about the ideas of them being a taboo in the first place. So I grew up to know, as long as it's safe and consensual, then there's really nothing wrong with it just let love be love. -says someone who is going to die single lol

The way the eye looks like a sunset, like someone's soul is sinking in flames. Listen. I'm not here to be some insistent LainxAlice shipper. Alice at least has, um, other interests? But they had something, right? lluNhpelA was just talking about it. You can absolutely how people could see it that way, especially once you get the idea of what it is that Alice has been trying to downplay and trust her friend about. And there's unpraiseworthy Lain, intruding from the corner with the face of a thousand memes. This scene has to be what it is to establish ideas about Lain and Alice's relationship, to put something under a cup so that when the carnie spins it around, you feel liike you know where it's gone. Yeah, she has a nice cat-got-the-cream look later, the classic ""my life now, Lain of the bedroom, enjoy the metaphorical-metaphysical cuck chair"" expression. But I can't help but sympathise. Poor Lain of the Other Side! Our girl had a bear onesie AND a best friend. Our other girl had... what? The head may not say it, but the heart knows that this episode is for the sake of LOVE.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      




Quiddy pog! 

> We'll see if I change my mind with what's left, but this has historically been my favorite episode of the show. An emotionally charged episode with the Alice - Lain stuff, the other Lain being quite over the top and some interesting imagery as well. Some good range from Bridget Hoffman in this episode playing two different versions of Lain. The whole concept of how one can be a totally different person online, one who can be totally unrestrained and become quite a horrible person I think has been a theme built up from earlier on, but really comes to a head here. Was Alice really having a relationship with that teacher? My position is no, she just fantasized about him. If anything I feel more strongly about it due to thematic stuff we get in the next episode. Which I'll have to wait until then to discuss.

Netflix and its horrible subtitles.,"So like the title says, but what the hell is the deal with Netflix subtitles?

To gives a little bit of info, I primarily sail the seas to watch anime, Plex server, Sonarr etc etc well last night my plex wasnt working and i didnt feel like messing with it because it was late, i turned on Netflix on a friends account. I scrolled through and decided I will start watching My Happy Marriage, it was on my watchlist but never got around to it.

For starters, the show is great, im only on episode 8 but such a great show.

The bad is the subtitling. Holy shit, im not sure what is worse, the terrible translations or the god awful timing on everything. The last time i really watched a netflix exclusive anime was Komi Cant Communicate, and i remember episode 1 of that was just horribly translated to the point where i waited for fan subs/encoders to fix it.

I went ahead and watched My Happy Marriage on my Plex and the corrected subtitles, and its noticeably different and better.

Since we're new to it I thought of starting with some Ecchi light stuff, I've read about Miru Tights, but it seems a bit too much to begin with. Maybe Saekano is a good option?

Also, feel free to recommend some more explicit content as well, since we're probably going to watch it later. Nothing crazy like tentacles or sci-fi stuff please. If it's funny and has a great story is a big plus.

My main issue with a sign of affection,"Let me start things off by saying i actually like this anime and i like its representation of people who are deaf, i love the character designs, and i love the setting of the story in college rather than high school.

My main problem with this anime is that i dont see the connection between the main girl and main guy at all. She gets a crush on him and then just immediately decides shes in love with him after she barely just met him and she barely had any interactions with him. I know this is the message they are trying to push with you just fall in love and you can decide when you are in love but still it just doesn’t make sense.

In contrast the second guy seems to be much more caring. I know hes a tsundere but deep down he cares for her and learned sign language for her and wants her safety but i know hes going to lose which is making my interest in this anime drop every episode.

The main guy is so touchy like he literally touches her without her consent and gets close to her without even asking at all. In real life this would be classified as some weird behavior but in this anime its portrayed as normal because hes “hot”",False,anime,1706045077.0,19dzg0u,Discussion

For example, my main two are Guts (Berserk) and Killy (Blame!) as they are both very existentialist characters walking in shells of their former world and tortured by losing the ones they care for, but still continue on, chasing a glimmer of hope.",False,anime,1706030676.0,19dtlf7,Discussion

Anime with the most solid soundtracks in your opinion?,"What are the shows with the overall best music? Not just one or two good OPs but also the EDs and OSTs? 

The anime that would fit perfectly into that criteria for me would be Kimi to Boku. None of the songs are what I would listen to usually but the entire soundtrack is god-tier for emotion and nostalgia. Literally not a single miss and it fits the feeling of fleeting youth of the anime so well. Especially the OSTs, I remember not being able to find those soundtracks until years after I actually watched the show 

Given is a close second too. A 1-season sorta-niche BL has no right to have a soundtrack this godly. Sets the standard for ANY music anime imo. I love Bocchi and Kongming too but they don't even come close to Given's soundtrack imo, any of the songs from Given has the potential to be a j-rock classic

It's been quite a few years since I've seen a battle-shounen but is it just me or does JJK seem particularly heavy with non-stop balls-to-the-wall fighting action? I like the overall plot pacing and the fights are fantastic.

I remember watching naruto, fairy tail etc and felt there was more daily life scenes and non-battle character interactions back then.

I love the characters in JJK but some on my favourite scenes are when they go shopping or when they do that random baseball match.

Help me find the title of this anime?,"I saw this anime like 20+ years ago and cannot for the life of me figure out what it is, despite searching multiple times over the years. I only saw one episode and really want to watch the rest if I can figure out what it is...

For the main characters, there was a girl and a dude adventuring together. The guy is kind of silly and can turn into a badass looking dragon, but I think it may only be if he is in a lot of trouble/ very hurt. I don't remember much about the girl. 

In the episode, the two are captured and are taken into a palace where they are strung up on a cross and semi- tortured. In the palace, there is a princess who is very hardened and cold. Later in the episode, it is revealed that the princess had been brainwashed and the real king and queen had been murdered by the current fake king and queen (i think there was a fire?). I think the adventurers try to help the princess, but from my memory, it was a bittersweet ending, and the dude turned into a dragon, destroyed a bunch of stuff, but I think the princess ended up dying. In the end, the girl flew away in the back of the dragon. 

I remember the art style having a lot of red tones and the overall tone of the anime was more somber than light hearted.

Looking for a particular anime that I can't remember the name of,"I feel like I remember watching at least some of it if not the entirety of the first season but it was a while ago. Let me try to break down some key points.


There's a 'Tower' of sorts, and it costs a lot to get into it I believe, but our main character got either teleported or isekai'd to a high floor of the tower, can't remember exactly, just know he's gotten there completely by accident.


Our main character ends up stuck in a cave or cavern but ends up gardening in there with the help of bees that end up being of the monster girl variety and clearly think very highly of him. Things are working out great, as far as being stuck in a cave goes.


I think that he was contacted at some point by some higher power within the system of the world to figure out how he ended up there?


Anything here ringing any bells for anyone? Google hates me and just keeps sending me to a manwa that's got a somewhat similar premise but it's definitely not the right thing.

Need helping finding a specific anime,"Sorry if this is super vague, but all Ive got is my fuzzy ass memory on the matter with barely any leads.

Im trying to find a very specific anime that id forgotten the name to and the names to the characters. I cant shake the feeling that it's Devilman, but thats probably super wrong. Everytime I look something even remotely close to what im searching for, nothing of its likeness seems to ever come up.

Lets cut to the chase. There are three very distinct images I get in my head when I try to search my memories for this anime. The first is of a young adult, maybe im his 20s, that suffers from anger issues. He is dark-skinned and has a pretty striking similarity to Akira from Devilman. He's got the ability to transform into a demon or devil like monster each time he is enraged and loses control. He recall a fight scene of him and his childhood from fighting to the death on a rooftop of a building somewhere in the slums. The friend has white hair, is pale skinned and uses a mobile humanoid mech suit to fight.

The second image I have in my mind is of the devil man in a ruined building, close to death from a different fight with his mech friend after trying to save a girl. The mech suit friend has this sort of righteous personality where he believes himself the savior from this devil man. So he is ok with sacrificing one life for many, whilst the devil man is not and is also in love with this girl.

The last image which is also my strongest:

The devilman is a young boy, light skinned, long ungroomed hair, as if homeless. He is walking in a park, enranged and hunting a frog face demon that is disguised as a man. This frog face demon uaed his tongue as a weapon to hunt humans and i think the boys mother was one of the victims. The frog face demon has a blade at the tip of his tongue. When the boy finds him, he beats the shit out of him in a pretty badass way.


This is all I can remember and no matter how much I search, I cannot find it but it sits so strongly in my mind to be all in my head.

Unboxiois finally made it!! He has a fun story about the hidden 7 black presidents which leads me to asking, which ones!? XD 
>I met a guy IRL once who was convinced that ancient Egypt didn't exist and that the US had 7 black presidents who were president before George Washington. That's more of a conspiracy theory than a rumor, but these things aren't so different, are they?


Zadcap made an aspiring comment yesterday about how despite the Clamp girls being genuine degenerates who should be behind bars, that they kinda have a point. 
> The worse part is, as a young and impressionable child, CCS was a gateway into the rest of CLAMP as much as it was the start of my eternal Mahou Shoujo love. There was not a single forbidden romance those ladies didn't try to put on paper, and I read more taboo love stories than I can remember before I learned about the ideas of them being a taboo in the first place. So I grew up to know, as long as it's safe and consensual, then there's really nothing wrong with it just let love be love. -says someone who is going to die single lol

You can absolutely how people could see it that way, especially once you get the idea of what it is that Alice has been trying to downplay and trust her friend about. And there's unpraiseworthy Lain, intruding from the corner with the face of a thousand memes. This scene has to be what it is to establish ideas about Lain and Alice's relationship, to put something under a cup so that when the carnie spins it around, you feel liike you know where it's gone. Yeah, she has a nice cat-got-the-cream look later, the classic ""my life now, Lain of the bedroom, enjoy the metaphorical-metaphysical cuck chair"" expression. But I can't help but sympathise.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      




Quiddy pog! 

> We'll see if I change my mind with what's left, but this has historically been my favorite episode of the show. An emotionally charged episode with the Alice - Lain stuff, the other Lain being quite over the top and some interesting imagery as well. Some good range from Bridget Hoffman in this episode playing two different versions of Lain. The whole concept of how one can be a totally different person online, one who can be totally unrestrained and become quite a horrible person I think has been a theme built up from earlier on, but really comes to a head here. Was Alice really having a relationship with that teacher? My position is no, she just fantasized about him. If anything I feel more strongly about it due to thematic stuff we get in the next episode. Which I'll have to wait until then to discuss.

The bad is the subtitling. Holy shit, im not sure what is worse, the terrible translations or the god awful timing on everything. The last time i really watched a netflix exclusive anime was Komi Cant Communicate, and i remember episode 1 of that was just horribly translated to the point where i waited for fan subs/encoders to fix it.

I went ahead and watched My Happy Marriage on my Plex and the corrected subtitles, and its noticeably different and better.

Honestly I really want to watch Delicious In Dungeon but im thinking of just waiting it out because so far, netflix is 0 for 2 in terms of subtitling quality.",False,anime,1706045438.0,19dzlcb,Discussion
LF Recommendation: Ecchi/Hentai/Nylon for couple new to it,"As the title says, recently my GF got into hentai. So she asked me to look for some good high-quality erotic/romantic content that we can both watch and enjoy it together. 

If it helps, we're both really into nylon, pantyhose, tights and this kind of stuff, so we would appreciate something around it.

Since we're new to it I thought of starting with some Ecchi light stuff, I've read about Miru Tights, but it seems a bit too much to begin with. Maybe Saekano is a good option?

Also, feel free to recommend some more explicit content as well, since we're probably going to watch it later. Nothing crazy like tentacles or sci-fi stuff please. If it's funny and has a great story is a big plus.

My main issue with a sign of affection,"Let me start things off by saying i actually like this anime and i like its representation of people who are deaf, i love the character designs, and i love the setting of the story in college rather than high school.

My main problem with this anime is that i dont see the connection between the main girl and main guy at all. She gets a crush on him and then just immediately decides shes in love with him after she barely just met him and she barely had any interactions with him. I know this is the message they are trying to push with you just fall in love and you can decide when you are in love but still it just doesn’t make sense.

In contrast the second guy seems to be much more caring. I know hes a tsundere but deep down he cares for her and learned sign language for her and wants her safety but i know hes going to lose which is making my interest in this anime drop every episode.

The main guy is so touchy like he literally touches her without her consent and gets close to her without even asking at all. In real life this would be classified as some weird behavior but in this anime its portrayed as normal because hes “hot”",False,anime,1706045077.0,19dzg0u,Discussion

Anime with the most solid soundtracks in your opinion?,"What are the shows with the overall best music? Not just one or two good OPs but also the EDs and OSTs? 

The anime that would fit perfectly into that criteria for me would be Kimi to Boku. None of the songs are what I would listen to usually but the entire soundtrack is god-tier for emotion and nostalgia. Literally not a single miss and it fits the feeling of fleeting youth of the anime so well. Especially the OSTs, I remember not being able to find those soundtracks until years after I actually watched the show 

Given is a close second too. A 1-season sorta-niche BL has no right to have a soundtrack this godly. Sets the standard for ANY music anime imo. I love Bocchi and Kongming too but they don't even come close to Given's soundtrack imo, any of the songs from Given has the potential to be a j-rock classic

Help me find the title of this anime?,"I saw this anime like 20+ years ago and cannot for the life of me figure out what it is, despite searching multiple times over the years. I only saw one episode and really want to watch the rest if I can figure out what it is...

For the main characters, there was a girl and a dude adventuring together. The guy is kind of silly and can turn into a badass looking dragon, but I think it may only be if he is in a lot of trouble/ very hurt. I don't remember much about the girl. 

In the episode, the two are captured and are taken into a palace where they are strung up on a cross and semi- tortured. In the palace, there is a princess who is very hardened and cold. Later in the episode, it is revealed that the princess had been brainwashed and the real king and queen had been murdered by the current fake king and queen (i think there was a fire?). I think the adventurers try to help the princess, but from my memory, it was a bittersweet ending, and the dude turned into a dragon, destroyed a bunch of stuff, but I think the princess ended up dying. In the end, the girl flew away in the back of the dragon. 

I remember the art style having a lot of red tones and the overall tone of the anime was more somber than light hearted.

Looking for a particular anime that I can't remember the name of,"I feel like I remember watching at least some of it if not the entirety of the first season but it was a while ago. Let me try to break down some key points.


There's a 'Tower' of sorts, and it costs a lot to get into it I believe, but our main character got either teleported or isekai'd to a high floor of the tower, can't remember exactly, just know he's gotten there completely by accident.


Our main character ends up stuck in a cave or cavern but ends up gardening in there with the help of bees that end up being of the monster girl variety and clearly think very highly of him. Things are working out great, as far as being stuck in a cave goes.


I think that he was contacted at some point by some higher power within the system of the world to figure out how he ended up there?


Anything here ringing any bells for anyone? Google hates me and just keeps sending me to a manwa that's got a somewhat similar premise but it's definitely not the right thing.

Need helping finding a specific anime,"Sorry if this is super vague, but all Ive got is my fuzzy ass memory on the matter with barely any leads.

Im trying to find a very specific anime that id forgotten the name to and the names to the characters. I cant shake the feeling that it's Devilman, but thats probably super wrong. Everytime I look something even remotely close to what im searching for, nothing of its likeness seems to ever come up.

Lets cut to the chase. There are three very distinct images I get in my head when I try to search my memories for this anime. The first is of a young adult, maybe im his 20s, that suffers from anger issues. He is dark-skinned and has a pretty striking similarity to Akira from Devilman. He's got the ability to transform into a demon or devil like monster each time he is enraged and loses control. He recall a fight scene of him and his childhood from fighting to the death on a rooftop of a building somewhere in the slums. The friend has white hair, is pale skinned and uses a mobile humanoid mech suit to fight.

The second image I have in my mind is of the devil man in a ruined building, close to death from a different fight with his mech friend after trying to save a girl. The mech suit friend has this sort of righteous personality where he believes himself the savior from this devil man. So he is ok with sacrificing one life for many, whilst the devil man is not and is also in love with this girl.

The last image which is also my strongest:

The devilman is a young boy, light skinned, long ungroomed hair, as if homeless. He is walking in a park, enranged and hunting a frog face demon that is disguised as a man. This frog face demon uaed his tongue as a weapon to hunt humans and i think the boys mother was one of the victims. The frog face demon has a blade at the tip of his tongue. When the boy finds him, he beats the shit out of him in a pretty badass way.


This is all I can remember and no matter how much I search, I cannot find it but it sits so strongly in my mind to be all in my head.

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
Unboxiois finally made it!! He has a fun story about the hidden 7 black presidents which leads me to asking, which ones!? XD 
>I met a guy IRL once who was convinced that ancient Egypt didn't exist and that the US had 7 black presidents who were president before George Washington. That's more of a conspiracy theory than a rumor, but these things aren't so different, are they?


Zadcap made an aspiring comment yesterday about how despite the Clamp girls being genuine degenerates who should be behind bars, that they kinda have a point. 
> The worse part is, as a young and impressionable child, CCS was a gateway into the rest of CLAMP as much as it was the start of my eternal Mahou Shoujo love. There was not a single forbidden romance those ladies didn't try to put on paper, and I read more taboo love stories than I can remember before I learned about the ideas of them being a taboo in the first place. So I grew up to know, as long as it's safe and consensual, then there's really nothing wrong with it just let love be love. -says someone who is going to die single lol



SilkyStrawberryMilk totally pwned that dumb Lain of the Kusogaki!! You show her!!

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!"" 


DegenerateRegime fights in the name of LOVE! 

>That's not the [right prompt](https://i.imgur.com/jLs1VgR.png). Look at that [=w=](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyugfHPOFBE) homewrecker. The way the eye looks like a sunset, like someone's soul is sinking in flames. Listen. I'm not here to be some insistent LainxAlice shipper. Alice at least has, um, other interests? But they had something, right? lluNhpelA was just talking about it. You can absolutely how people could see it that way, especially once you get the idea of what it is that Alice has been trying to downplay and trust her friend about. And there's unpraiseworthy Lain, intruding from the corner with the face of a thousand memes. This scene has to be what it is to establish ideas about Lain and Alice's relationship, to put something under a cup so that when the carnie spins it around, you feel liike you know where it's gone. Yeah, she has a nice cat-got-the-cream look later, the classic ""my life now, Lain of the bedroom, enjoy the metaphorical-metaphysical cuck chair"" expression. But I can't help but sympathise. Poor Lain of the Other Side! Our girl had a bear onesie AND a best friend. Our other girl had... what? The head may not say it, but the heart knows that this episode is for the sake of LOVE.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      




Quiddy pog! 

> We'll see if I change my mind with what's left, but this has historically been my favorite episode of the show. An emotionally charged episode with the Alice - Lain stuff, the other Lain being quite over the top and some interesting imagery as well. Some good range from Bridget Hoffman in this episode playing two different versions of Lain. The whole concept of how one can be a totally different person online, one who can be totally unrestrained and become quite a horrible person I think has been a theme built up from earlier on, but really comes to a head here. Was Alice really having a relationship with that teacher? My position is no, she just fantasized about him. If anything I feel more strongly about it due to thematic stuff we get in the next episode. Which I'll have to wait until then to discuss.

Please help me to remember this Vampire Anime short film's name!,"I have watched an anime short film about a vampire, 10 maybe 15 years ago. In medieval age, he located in some castle, a little girl find him to request help. Little girls village conquered by bunch of warriors or something else like that. 

The little girl offers her books against the vampire's help. He helped girl and killed that warriors. Im not sure about it but, end of the movie, vampire sat on the top of the hill and read books which were given by the girl against his help.

Netflix and its horrible subtitles.,"So like the title says, but what the hell is the deal with Netflix subtitles?

To gives a little bit of info, I primarily sail the seas to watch anime, Plex server, Sonarr etc etc well last night my plex wasnt working and i didnt feel like messing with it because it was late, i turned on Netflix on a friends account. I scrolled through and decided I will start watching My Happy Marriage, it was on my watchlist but never got around to it.

For starters, the show is great, im only on episode 8 but such a great show.

The bad is the subtitling. Holy shit, im not sure what is worse, the terrible translations or the god awful timing on everything. The last time i really watched a netflix exclusive anime was Komi Cant Communicate, and i remember episode 1 of that was just horribly translated to the point where i waited for fan subs/encoders to fix it.

I went ahead and watched My Happy Marriage on my Plex and the corrected subtitles, and its noticeably different and better.

Honestly I really want to watch Delicious In Dungeon but im thinking of just waiting it out because so far, netflix is 0 for 2 in terms of subtitling quality.",False,anime,1706045438.0,19dzlcb,Discussion
LF Recommendation: Ecchi/Hentai/Nylon for couple new to it,"As the title says, recently my GF got into hentai. So she asked me to look for some good high-quality erotic/romantic content that we can both watch and enjoy it together. 

If it helps, we're both really into nylon, pantyhose, tights and this kind of stuff, so we would appreciate something around it.

Since we're new to it I thought of starting with some Ecchi light stuff, I've read about Miru Tights, but it seems a bit too much to begin with. Maybe Saekano is a good option?

Also, feel free to recommend some more explicit content as well, since we're probably going to watch it later. Nothing crazy like tentacles or sci-fi stuff please. If it's funny and has a great story is a big plus.

My main issue with a sign of affection,"Let me start things off by saying i actually like this anime and i like its representation of people who are deaf, i love the character designs, and i love the setting of the story in college rather than high school.

My main problem with this anime is that i dont see the connection between the main girl and main guy at all. She gets a crush on him and then just immediately decides shes in love with him after she barely just met him and she barely had any interactions with him. I know this is the message they are trying to push with you just fall in love and you can decide when you are in love but still it just doesn’t make sense.

In contrast the second guy seems to be much more caring. I know hes a tsundere but deep down he cares for her and learned sign language for her and wants her safety but i know hes going to lose which is making my interest in this anime drop every episode.

The main guy is so touchy like he literally touches her without her consent and gets close to her without even asking at all. In real life this would be classified as some weird behavior but in this anime its portrayed as normal because hes “hot”",False,anime,1706045077.0,19dzg0u,Discussion

Anime with the most solid soundtracks in your opinion?,"What are the shows with the overall best music? Not just one or two good OPs but also the EDs and OSTs? 

The anime that would fit perfectly into that criteria for me would be Kimi to Boku. None of the songs are what I would listen to usually but the entire soundtrack is god-tier for emotion and nostalgia. Literally not a single miss and it fits the feeling of fleeting youth of the anime so well. Especially the OSTs, I remember not being able to find those soundtracks until years after I actually watched the show 

Given is a close second too. A 1-season sorta-niche BL has no right to have a soundtrack this godly. Sets the standard for ANY music anime imo. I love Bocchi and Kongming too but they don't even come close to Given's soundtrack imo, any of the songs from Given has the potential to be a j-rock classic 

Making this post because Kimi to Boku no Banka came up on my playlist and the nostalgia just hit so fucking hard",False,anime,1706020140.0,19dpnbg,Discussion

JJK - what to expect?,"Not complaining, just trying to figure something out and get opinions because no one I know watches anime.

It's been quite a few years since I've seen a battle-shounen but is it just me or does JJK seem particularly heavy with non-stop balls-to-the-wall fighting action? I like the overall plot pacing and the fights are fantastic.

I remember watching naruto, fairy tail etc and felt there was more daily life scenes and non-battle character interactions back then.

I love the characters in JJK but some on my favourite scenes are when they go shopping or when they do that random baseball match.

 I just get tired after watching more than 2 or 3 episodes from all the back-to-back fights lol. Did I just get older and can't handle the adrenaline now?  Is that manga any different?",False,anime,1706005320.0,19dlcmy,Help
Help me find the title of this anime?,"I saw this anime like 20+ years ago and cannot for the life of me figure out what it is, despite searching multiple times over the years. I only saw one episode and really want to watch the rest if I can figure out what it is...

For the main characters, there was a girl and a dude adventuring together. The guy is kind of silly and can turn into a badass looking dragon, but I think it may only be if he is in a lot of trouble/ very hurt. I don't remember much about the girl. 

In the episode, the two are captured and are taken into a palace where they are strung up on a cross and semi- tortured. In the palace, there is a princess who is very hardened and cold. Later in the episode, it is revealed that the princess had been brainwashed and the real king and queen had been murdered by the current fake king and queen (i think there was a fire?). I think the adventurers try to help the princess, but from my memory, it was a bittersweet ending, and the dude turned into a dragon, destroyed a bunch of stuff, but I think the princess ended up dying. In the end, the girl flew away in the back of the dragon. 

I remember the art style having a lot of red tones and the overall tone of the anime was more somber than light hearted.

Looking for a particular anime that I can't remember the name of,"I feel like I remember watching at least some of it if not the entirety of the first season but it was a while ago. Let me try to break down some key points.


There's a 'Tower' of sorts, and it costs a lot to get into it I believe, but our main character got either teleported or isekai'd to a high floor of the tower, can't remember exactly, just know he's gotten there completely by accident.


Our main character ends up stuck in a cave or cavern but ends up gardening in there with the help of bees that end up being of the monster girl variety and clearly think very highly of him. Things are working out great, as far as being stuck in a cave goes.


I think that he was contacted at some point by some higher power within the system of the world to figure out how he ended up there?


Anything here ringing any bells for anyone? Google hates me and just keeps sending me to a manwa that's got a somewhat similar premise but it's definitely not the right thing.

Need helping finding a specific anime,"Sorry if this is super vague, but all Ive got is my fuzzy ass memory on the matter with barely any leads.

Im trying to find a very specific anime that id forgotten the name to and the names to the characters. I cant shake the feeling that it's Devilman, but thats probably super wrong. Everytime I look something even remotely close to what im searching for, nothing of its likeness seems to ever come up.

Lets cut to the chase. There are three very distinct images I get in my head when I try to search my memories for this anime. The first is of a young adult, maybe im his 20s, that suffers from anger issues. He is dark-skinned and has a pretty striking similarity to Akira from Devilman. He's got the ability to transform into a demon or devil like monster each time he is enraged and loses control. He recall a fight scene of him and his childhood from fighting to the death on a rooftop of a building somewhere in the slums. The friend has white hair, is pale skinned and uses a mobile humanoid mech suit to fight.

The second image I have in my mind is of the devil man in a ruined building, close to death from a different fight with his mech friend after trying to save a girl. The mech suit friend has this sort of righteous personality where he believes himself the savior from this devil man. So he is ok with sacrificing one life for many, whilst the devil man is not and is also in love with this girl.

The last image which is also my strongest:

The devilman is a young boy, light skinned, long ungroomed hair, as if homeless. He is walking in a park, enranged and hunting a frog face demon that is disguised as a man. This frog face demon uaed his tongue as a weapon to hunt humans and i think the boys mother was one of the victims. The frog face demon has a blade at the tip of his tongue. When the boy finds him, he beats the shit out of him in a pretty badass way.


This is all I can remember and no matter how much I search, I cannot find it but it sits so strongly in my mind to be all in my head.

Like I don’t know if Chainsaw Man himself would fall under the trope as at first, he just looks like the kind of guy that just wants to score with babes, but then as the series goes on, he is shown to be a very competent fighter in battle as he can somehow wield 3 enormous chainsaws without impaling himself.

Unboxiois finally made it!! He has a fun story about the hidden 7 black presidents which leads me to asking, which ones!? XD 
>I met a guy IRL once who was convinced that ancient Egypt didn't exist and that the US had 7 black presidents who were president before George Washington. That's more of a conspiracy theory than a rumor, but these things aren't so different, are they?


Zadcap made an aspiring comment yesterday about how despite the Clamp girls being genuine degenerates who should be behind bars, that they kinda have a point. 
> The worse part is, as a young and impressionable child, CCS was a gateway into the rest of CLAMP as much as it was the start of my eternal Mahou Shoujo love. There was not a single forbidden romance those ladies didn't try to put on paper, and I read more taboo love stories than I can remember before I learned about the ideas of them being a taboo in the first place. So I grew up to know, as long as it's safe and consensual, then there's really nothing wrong with it just let love be love. -says someone who is going to die single lol

The way the eye looks like a sunset, like someone's soul is sinking in flames. Listen. I'm not here to be some insistent LainxAlice shipper. Alice at least has, um, other interests? But they had something, right? lluNhpelA was just talking about it. You can absolutely how people could see it that way, especially once you get the idea of what it is that Alice has been trying to downplay and trust her friend about. And there's unpraiseworthy Lain, intruding from the corner with the face of a thousand memes. This scene has to be what it is to establish ideas about Lain and Alice's relationship, to put something under a cup so that when the carnie spins it around, you feel liike you know where it's gone. Yeah, she has a nice cat-got-the-cream look later, the classic ""my life now, Lain of the bedroom, enjoy the metaphorical-metaphysical cuck chair"" expression. But I can't help but sympathise. Poor Lain of the Other Side! Our girl had a bear onesie AND a best friend. Our other girl had... what? The head may not say it, but the heart knows that this episode is for the sake of LOVE.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      




Quiddy pog! 

> We'll see if I change my mind with what's left, but this has historically been my favorite episode of the show. An emotionally charged episode with the Alice - Lain stuff, the other Lain being quite over the top and some interesting imagery as well. Some good range from Bridget Hoffman in this episode playing two different versions of Lain. The whole concept of how one can be a totally different person online, one who can be totally unrestrained and become quite a horrible person I think has been a theme built up from earlier on, but really comes to a head here. Was Alice really having a relationship with that teacher? My position is no, she just fantasized about him. If anything I feel more strongly about it due to thematic stuff we get in the next episode. Which I'll have to wait until then to discuss.

Netflix and its horrible subtitles.,"So like the title says, but what the hell is the deal with Netflix subtitles?

To gives a little bit of info, I primarily sail the seas to watch anime, Plex server, Sonarr etc etc well last night my plex wasnt working and i didnt feel like messing with it because it was late, i turned on Netflix on a friends account. I scrolled through and decided I will start watching My Happy Marriage, it was on my watchlist but never got around to it.

For starters, the show is great, im only on episode 8 but such a great show.

The bad is the subtitling. Holy shit, im not sure what is worse, the terrible translations or the god awful timing on everything. The last time i really watched a netflix exclusive anime was Komi Cant Communicate, and i remember episode 1 of that was just horribly translated to the point where i waited for fan subs/encoders to fix it.

I went ahead and watched My Happy Marriage on my Plex and the corrected subtitles, and its noticeably different and better.

Since we're new to it I thought of starting with some Ecchi light stuff, I've read about Miru Tights, but it seems a bit too much to begin with. Maybe Saekano is a good option?

My main issue with a sign of affection,"Let me start things off by saying i actually like this anime and i like its representation of people who are deaf, i love the character designs, and i love the setting of the story in college rather than high school.

My main problem with this anime is that i dont see the connection between the main girl and main guy at all. She gets a crush on him and then just immediately decides shes in love with him after she barely just met him and she barely had any interactions with him. I know this is the message they are trying to push with you just fall in love and you can decide when you are in love but still it just doesn’t make sense.

In contrast the second guy seems to be much more caring. I know hes a tsundere but deep down he cares for her and learned sign language for her and wants her safety but i know hes going to lose which is making my interest in this anime drop every episode.

The main guy is so touchy like he literally touches her without her consent and gets close to her without even asking at all. In real life this would be classified as some weird behavior but in this anime its portrayed as normal because hes “hot”",False,anime,1706045077.0,19dzg0u,Discussion

Straight Up Favorite Anime Characters! And why?,"Inspired by a post which mentioned which anime characters motivate you, but I think that motivation is just one connection that we can get from our favorite characters. 

We can connect to a good sense of humor, a just cause, an interesting approach to the world, or a thousand other things.

For example, my main two are Guts (Berserk) and Killy (Blame!) as they are both very existentialist characters walking in shells of their former world and tortured by losing the ones they care for, but still continue on, chasing a glimmer of hope.",False,anime,1706030676.0,19dtlf7,Discussion

Anime with the most solid soundtracks in your opinion?,"What are the shows with the overall best music? Not just one or two good OPs but also the EDs and OSTs? 

The anime that would fit perfectly into that criteria for me would be Kimi to Boku. None of the songs are what I would listen to usually but the entire soundtrack is god-tier for emotion and nostalgia. Literally not a single miss and it fits the feeling of fleeting youth of the anime so well. Especially the OSTs, I remember not being able to find those soundtracks until years after I actually watched the show 

Given is a close second too. A 1-season sorta-niche BL has no right to have a soundtrack this godly. Sets the standard for ANY music anime imo. I love Bocchi and Kongming too but they don't even come close to Given's soundtrack imo, any of the songs from Given has the potential to be a j-rock classic

I remember watching naruto, fairy tail etc and felt there was more daily life scenes and non-battle character interactions back then.

I love the characters in JJK but some on my favourite scenes are when they go shopping or when they do that random baseball match.

Help me find the title of this anime?,"I saw this anime like 20+ years ago and cannot for the life of me figure out what it is, despite searching multiple times over the years. I only saw one episode and really want to watch the rest if I can figure out what it is...

For the main characters, there was a girl and a dude adventuring together. The guy is kind of silly and can turn into a badass looking dragon, but I think it may only be if he is in a lot of trouble/ very hurt. I don't remember much about the girl. 

In the episode, the two are captured and are taken into a palace where they are strung up on a cross and semi- tortured. In the palace, there is a princess who is very hardened and cold. Later in the episode, it is revealed that the princess had been brainwashed and the real king and queen had been murdered by the current fake king and queen (i think there was a fire?). I think the adventurers try to help the princess, but from my memory, it was a bittersweet ending, and the dude turned into a dragon, destroyed a bunch of stuff, but I think the princess ended up dying. In the end, the girl flew away in the back of the dragon. 

I remember the art style having a lot of red tones and the overall tone of the anime was more somber than light hearted.

Looking for a particular anime that I can't remember the name of,"I feel like I remember watching at least some of it if not the entirety of the first season but it was a while ago. Let me try to break down some key points.


There's a 'Tower' of sorts, and it costs a lot to get into it I believe, but our main character got either teleported or isekai'd to a high floor of the tower, can't remember exactly, just know he's gotten there completely by accident.


Our main character ends up stuck in a cave or cavern but ends up gardening in there with the help of bees that end up being of the monster girl variety and clearly think very highly of him. Things are working out great, as far as being stuck in a cave goes.


I think that he was contacted at some point by some higher power within the system of the world to figure out how he ended up there?


Anything here ringing any bells for anyone? Google hates me and just keeps sending me to a manwa that's got a somewhat similar premise but it's definitely not the right thing.

Need helping finding a specific anime,"Sorry if this is super vague, but all Ive got is my fuzzy ass memory on the matter with barely any leads.

Im trying to find a very specific anime that id forgotten the name to and the names to the characters. I cant shake the feeling that it's Devilman, but thats probably super wrong. Everytime I look something even remotely close to what im searching for, nothing of its likeness seems to ever come up.

Lets cut to the chase. There are three very distinct images I get in my head when I try to search my memories for this anime. The first is of a young adult, maybe im his 20s, that suffers from anger issues. He is dark-skinned and has a pretty striking similarity to Akira from Devilman. He's got the ability to transform into a demon or devil like monster each time he is enraged and loses control. He recall a fight scene of him and his childhood from fighting to the death on a rooftop of a building somewhere in the slums. The friend has white hair, is pale skinned and uses a mobile humanoid mech suit to fight.

The second image I have in my mind is of the devil man in a ruined building, close to death from a different fight with his mech friend after trying to save a girl. The mech suit friend has this sort of righteous personality where he believes himself the savior from this devil man. So he is ok with sacrificing one life for many, whilst the devil man is not and is also in love with this girl.

The last image which is also my strongest:

The devilman is a young boy, light skinned, long ungroomed hair, as if homeless. He is walking in a park, enranged and hunting a frog face demon that is disguised as a man. This frog face demon uaed his tongue as a weapon to hunt humans and i think the boys mother was one of the victims. The frog face demon has a blade at the tip of his tongue. When the boy finds him, he beats the shit out of him in a pretty badass way.


This is all I can remember and no matter how much I search, I cannot find it but it sits so strongly in my mind to be all in my head.

Unboxiois finally made it!! He has a fun story about the hidden 7 black presidents which leads me to asking, which ones!? XD 
>I met a guy IRL once who was convinced that ancient Egypt didn't exist and that the US had 7 black presidents who were president before George Washington. That's more of a conspiracy theory than a rumor, but these things aren't so different, are they?


Zadcap made an aspiring comment yesterday about how despite the Clamp girls being genuine degenerates who should be behind bars, that they kinda have a point. 
> The worse part is, as a young and impressionable child, CCS was a gateway into the rest of CLAMP as much as it was the start of my eternal Mahou Shoujo love. There was not a single forbidden romance those ladies didn't try to put on paper, and I read more taboo love stories than I can remember before I learned about the ideas of them being a taboo in the first place. So I grew up to know, as long as it's safe and consensual, then there's really nothing wrong with it just let love be love. -says someone who is going to die single lol

But they had something, right? lluNhpelA was just talking about it. You can absolutely how people could see it that way, especially once you get the idea of what it is that Alice has been trying to downplay and trust her friend about. And there's unpraiseworthy Lain, intruding from the corner with the face of a thousand memes. This scene has to be what it is to establish ideas about Lain and Alice's relationship, to put something under a cup so that when the carnie spins it around, you feel liike you know where it's gone. Yeah, she has a nice cat-got-the-cream look later, the classic ""my life now, Lain of the bedroom, enjoy the metaphorical-metaphysical cuck chair"" expression. But I can't help but sympathise. Poor Lain of the Other Side! Our girl had a bear onesie AND a best friend. Our other girl had... what? The head may not say it, but the heart knows that this episode is for the sake of LOVE.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      




Quiddy pog! 

> We'll see if I change my mind with what's left, but this has historically been my favorite episode of the show. An emotionally charged episode with the Alice - Lain stuff, the other Lain being quite over the top and some interesting imagery as well. Some good range from Bridget Hoffman in this episode playing two different versions of Lain. The whole concept of how one can be a totally different person online, one who can be totally unrestrained and become quite a horrible person I think has been a theme built up from earlier on, but really comes to a head here. Was Alice really having a relationship with that teacher? My position is no, she just fantasized about him. If anything I feel more strongly about it due to thematic stuff we get in the next episode. Which I'll have to wait until then to discuss.

Netflix and its horrible subtitles.,"So like the title says, but what the hell is the deal with Netflix subtitles?

To gives a little bit of info, I primarily sail the seas to watch anime, Plex server, Sonarr etc etc well last night my plex wasnt working and i didnt feel like messing with it because it was late, i turned on Netflix on a friends account. I scrolled through and decided I will start watching My Happy Marriage, it was on my watchlist but never got around to it.

For starters, the show is great, im only on episode 8 but such a great show.

The bad is the subtitling. Holy shit, im not sure what is worse, the terrible translations or the god awful timing on everything. The last time i really watched a netflix exclusive anime was Komi Cant Communicate, and i remember episode 1 of that was just horribly translated to the point where i waited for fan subs/encoders to fix it.

I went ahead and watched My Happy Marriage on my Plex and the corrected subtitles, and its noticeably different and better.

Honestly I really want to watch Delicious In Dungeon but im thinking of just waiting it out because so far, netflix is 0 for 2 in terms of subtitling quality.",False,anime,1706045438.0,19dzlcb,Discussion
LF Recommendation: Ecchi/Hentai/Nylon for couple new to it,"As the title says, recently my GF got into hentai. So she asked me to look for some good high-quality erotic/romantic content that we can both watch and enjoy it together. 

If it helps, we're both really into nylon, pantyhose, tights and this kind of stuff, so we would appreciate something around it.

Since we're new to it I thought of starting with some Ecchi light stuff, I've read about Miru Tights, but it seems a bit too much to begin with. Maybe Saekano is a good option?

Also, feel free to recommend some more explicit content as well, since we're probably going to watch it later. Nothing crazy like tentacles or sci-fi stuff please. If it's funny and has a great story is a big plus.

My main issue with a sign of affection,"Let me start things off by saying i actually like this anime and i like its representation of people who are deaf, i love the character designs, and i love the setting of the story in college rather than high school.

My main problem with this anime is that i dont see the connection between the main girl and main guy at all. She gets a crush on him and then just immediately decides shes in love with him after she barely just met him and she barely had any interactions with him. I know this is the message they are trying to push with you just fall in love and you can decide when you are in love but still it just doesn’t make sense.

In contrast the second guy seems to be much more caring. I know hes a tsundere but deep down he cares for her and learned sign language for her and wants her safety but i know hes going to lose which is making my interest in this anime drop every episode.

The main guy is so touchy like he literally touches her without her consent and gets close to her without even asking at all. In real life this would be classified as some weird behavior but in this anime its portrayed as normal because hes “hot”",False,anime,1706045077.0,19dzg0u,Discussion

Anime with the most solid soundtracks in your opinion?,"What are the shows with the overall best music? Not just one or two good OPs but also the EDs and OSTs? 

The anime that would fit perfectly into that criteria for me would be Kimi to Boku. None of the songs are what I would listen to usually but the entire soundtrack is god-tier for emotion and nostalgia. Literally not a single miss and it fits the feeling of fleeting youth of the anime so well. Especially the OSTs, I remember not being able to find those soundtracks until years after I actually watched the show 

Given is a close second too. A 1-season sorta-niche BL has no right to have a soundtrack this godly. Sets the standard for ANY music anime imo. I love Bocchi and Kongming too but they don't even come close to Given's soundtrack imo, any of the songs from Given has the potential to be a j-rock classic

I remember watching naruto, fairy tail etc and felt there was more daily life scenes and non-battle character interactions back then.

Help me find the title of this anime?,"I saw this anime like 20+ years ago and cannot for the life of me figure out what it is, despite searching multiple times over the years. I only saw one episode and really want to watch the rest if I can figure out what it is...

For the main characters, there was a girl and a dude adventuring together. The guy is kind of silly and can turn into a badass looking dragon, but I think it may only be if he is in a lot of trouble/ very hurt. I don't remember much about the girl. 

In the episode, the two are captured and are taken into a palace where they are strung up on a cross and semi- tortured. In the palace, there is a princess who is very hardened and cold. Later in the episode, it is revealed that the princess had been brainwashed and the real king and queen had been murdered by the current fake king and queen (i think there was a fire?). I think the adventurers try to help the princess, but from my memory, it was a bittersweet ending, and the dude turned into a dragon, destroyed a bunch of stuff, but I think the princess ended up dying. In the end, the girl flew away in the back of the dragon. 

I remember the art style having a lot of red tones and the overall tone of the anime was more somber than light hearted.

The other one is, the mc doesn't want others to know how strong he is so he hides his powers, they try to teach him how to use magic but because he hides his real powers everyone thinks he's weak, I remember a scene when a girl tries to teach him how to walk on water but he can't and when the girl leaves he stands up (still on the water) and tells how tiring it is to hide his powers",False,anime,1706004773.0,19dl7xz,Help

Looking for a particular anime that I can't remember the name of,"I feel like I remember watching at least some of it if not the entirety of the first season but it was a while ago. Let me try to break down some key points.


There's a 'Tower' of sorts, and it costs a lot to get into it I believe, but our main character got either teleported or isekai'd to a high floor of the tower, can't remember exactly, just know he's gotten there completely by accident.


Our main character ends up stuck in a cave or cavern but ends up gardening in there with the help of bees that end up being of the monster girl variety and clearly think very highly of him. Things are working out great, as far as being stuck in a cave goes.


I think that he was contacted at some point by some higher power within the system of the world to figure out how he ended up there?


Anything here ringing any bells for anyone? Google hates me and just keeps sending me to a manwa that's got a somewhat similar premise but it's definitely not the right thing.

Need helping finding a specific anime,"Sorry if this is super vague, but all Ive got is my fuzzy ass memory on the matter with barely any leads.

Im trying to find a very specific anime that id forgotten the name to and the names to the characters. I cant shake the feeling that it's Devilman, but thats probably super wrong. Everytime I look something even remotely close to what im searching for, nothing of its likeness seems to ever come up.

Lets cut to the chase. There are three very distinct images I get in my head when I try to search my memories for this anime. The first is of a young adult, maybe im his 20s, that suffers from anger issues. He is dark-skinned and has a pretty striking similarity to Akira from Devilman. He's got the ability to transform into a demon or devil like monster each time he is enraged and loses control. He recall a fight scene of him and his childhood from fighting to the death on a rooftop of a building somewhere in the slums. The friend has white hair, is pale skinned and uses a mobile humanoid mech suit to fight.

The second image I have in my mind is of the devil man in a ruined building, close to death from a different fight with his mech friend after trying to save a girl. The mech suit friend has this sort of righteous personality where he believes himself the savior from this devil man. So he is ok with sacrificing one life for many, whilst the devil man is not and is also in love with this girl.

The last image which is also my strongest:

The devilman is a young boy, light skinned, long ungroomed hair, as if homeless. He is walking in a park, enranged and hunting a frog face demon that is disguised as a man. This frog face demon uaed his tongue as a weapon to hunt humans and i think the boys mother was one of the victims. The frog face demon has a blade at the tip of his tongue. When the boy finds him, he beats the shit out of him in a pretty badass way.


This is all I can remember and no matter how much I search, I cannot find it but it sits so strongly in my mind to be all in my head.

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
Unboxiois finally made it!! He has a fun story about the hidden 7 black presidents which leads me to asking, which ones!? XD 
>I met a guy IRL once who was convinced that ancient Egypt didn't exist and that the US had 7 black presidents who were president before George Washington. That's more of a conspiracy theory than a rumor, but these things aren't so different, are they?


Zadcap made an aspiring comment yesterday about how despite the Clamp girls being genuine degenerates who should be behind bars, that they kinda have a point. 
> The worse part is, as a young and impressionable child, CCS was a gateway into the rest of CLAMP as much as it was the start of my eternal Mahou Shoujo love. There was not a single forbidden romance those ladies didn't try to put on paper, and I read more taboo love stories than I can remember before I learned about the ideas of them being a taboo in the first place. So I grew up to know, as long as it's safe and consensual, then there's really nothing wrong with it just let love be love. -says someone who is going to die single lol

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!"" 


DegenerateRegime fights in the name of LOVE! 

>That's not the [right prompt](https://i.imgur.com/jLs1VgR.png). Look at that [=w=](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyugfHPOFBE) homewrecker. The way the eye looks like a sunset, like someone's soul is sinking in flames. Listen. I'm not here to be some insistent LainxAlice shipper. Alice at least has, um, other interests? But they had something, right? lluNhpelA was just talking about it. You can absolutely how people could see it that way, especially once you get the idea of what it is that Alice has been trying to downplay and trust her friend about. And there's unpraiseworthy Lain, intruding from the corner with the face of a thousand memes. This scene has to be what it is to establish ideas about Lain and Alice's relationship, to put something under a cup so that when the carnie spins it around, you feel liike you know where it's gone. Yeah, she has a nice cat-got-the-cream look later, the classic ""my life now, Lain of the bedroom, enjoy the metaphorical-metaphysical cuck chair"" expression. But I can't help but sympathise. Poor Lain of the Other Side! Our girl had a bear onesie AND a best friend. Our other girl had... what? The head may not say it, but the heart knows that this episode is for the sake of LOVE.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      




Quiddy pog! 

> We'll see if I change my mind with what's left, but this has historically been my favorite episode of the show. An emotionally charged episode with the Alice - Lain stuff, the other Lain being quite over the top and some interesting imagery as well. Some good range from Bridget Hoffman in this episode playing two different versions of Lain. The whole concept of how one can be a totally different person online, one who can be totally unrestrained and become quite a horrible person I think has been a theme built up from earlier on, but really comes to a head here. Was Alice really having a relationship with that teacher? My position is no, she just fantasized about him. If anything I feel more strongly about it due to thematic stuff we get in the next episode. Which I'll have to wait until then to discuss.

Netflix and its horrible subtitles.,"So like the title says, but what the hell is the deal with Netflix subtitles?

To gives a little bit of info, I primarily sail the seas to watch anime, Plex server, Sonarr etc etc well last night my plex wasnt working and i didnt feel like messing with it because it was late, i turned on Netflix on a friends account. I scrolled through and decided I will start watching My Happy Marriage, it was on my watchlist but never got around to it.

For starters, the show is great, im only on episode 8 but such a great show.

The bad is the subtitling. Holy shit, im not sure what is worse, the terrible translations or the god awful timing on everything. The last time i really watched a netflix exclusive anime was Komi Cant Communicate, and i remember episode 1 of that was just horribly translated to the point where i waited for fan subs/encoders to fix it.

I went ahead and watched My Happy Marriage on my Plex and the corrected subtitles, and its noticeably different and better.

Honestly I really want to watch Delicious In Dungeon but im thinking of just waiting it out because so far, netflix is 0 for 2 in terms of subtitling quality.",False,anime,1706045438.0,19dzlcb,Discussion

Since we're new to it I thought of starting with some Ecchi light stuff, I've read about Miru Tights, but it seems a bit too much to begin with. Maybe Saekano is a good option?

Also, feel free to recommend some more explicit content as well, since we're probably going to watch it later. Nothing crazy like tentacles or sci-fi stuff please. If it's funny and has a great story is a big plus.

My main issue with a sign of affection,"Let me start things off by saying i actually like this anime and i like its representation of people who are deaf, i love the character designs, and i love the setting of the story in college rather than high school.

My main problem with this anime is that i dont see the connection between the main girl and main guy at all. She gets a crush on him and then just immediately decides shes in love with him after she barely just met him and she barely had any interactions with him. I know this is the message they are trying to push with you just fall in love and you can decide when you are in love but still it just doesn’t make sense.

In contrast the second guy seems to be much more caring. I know hes a tsundere but deep down he cares for her and learned sign language for her and wants her safety but i know hes going to lose which is making my interest in this anime drop every episode.

The main guy is so touchy like he literally touches her without her consent and gets close to her without even asking at all. In real life this would be classified as some weird behavior but in this anime its portrayed as normal because hes “hot”",False,anime,1706045077.0,19dzg0u,Discussion

Anime with the most solid soundtracks in your opinion?,"What are the shows with the overall best music? Not just one or two good OPs but also the EDs and OSTs? 

The anime that would fit perfectly into that criteria for me would be Kimi to Boku. None of the songs are what I would listen to usually but the entire soundtrack is god-tier for emotion and nostalgia. Literally not a single miss and it fits the feeling of fleeting youth of the anime so well. Especially the OSTs, I remember not being able to find those soundtracks until years after I actually watched the show 

Given is a close second too. A 1-season sorta-niche BL has no right to have a soundtrack this godly. Sets the standard for ANY music anime imo. I love Bocchi and Kongming too but they don't even come close to Given's soundtrack imo, any of the songs from Given has the potential to be a j-rock classic

JJK - what to expect?,"Not complaining, just trying to figure something out and get opinions because no one I know watches anime.

It's been quite a few years since I've seen a battle-shounen but is it just me or does JJK seem particularly heavy with non-stop balls-to-the-wall fighting action? I like the overall plot pacing and the fights are fantastic.

I remember watching naruto, fairy tail etc and felt there was more daily life scenes and non-battle character interactions back then.

I love the characters in JJK but some on my favourite scenes are when they go shopping or when they do that random baseball match.

Help me find the title of this anime?,"I saw this anime like 20+ years ago and cannot for the life of me figure out what it is, despite searching multiple times over the years. I only saw one episode and really want to watch the rest if I can figure out what it is...

For the main characters, there was a girl and a dude adventuring together. The guy is kind of silly and can turn into a badass looking dragon, but I think it may only be if he is in a lot of trouble/ very hurt. I don't remember much about the girl. 

In the episode, the two are captured and are taken into a palace where they are strung up on a cross and semi- tortured. In the palace, there is a princess who is very hardened and cold. Later in the episode, it is revealed that the princess had been brainwashed and the real king and queen had been murdered by the current fake king and queen (i think there was a fire?). I think the adventurers try to help the princess, but from my memory, it was a bittersweet ending, and the dude turned into a dragon, destroyed a bunch of stuff, but I think the princess ended up dying. In the end, the girl flew away in the back of the dragon. 

I remember the art style having a lot of red tones and the overall tone of the anime was more somber than light hearted.

Looking for a particular anime that I can't remember the name of,"I feel like I remember watching at least some of it if not the entirety of the first season but it was a while ago. Let me try to break down some key points.


There's a 'Tower' of sorts, and it costs a lot to get into it I believe, but our main character got either teleported or isekai'd to a high floor of the tower, can't remember exactly, just know he's gotten there completely by accident.


Our main character ends up stuck in a cave or cavern but ends up gardening in there with the help of bees that end up being of the monster girl variety and clearly think very highly of him. Things are working out great, as far as being stuck in a cave goes.


I think that he was contacted at some point by some higher power within the system of the world to figure out how he ended up there?


Anything here ringing any bells for anyone? Google hates me and just keeps sending me to a manwa that's got a somewhat similar premise but it's definitely not the right thing.

Need help finding an older anime.,"Hi y'all,

So I've been trying to find an anime that I watched way back, but my memory is hazy around the details. So this is a total hail mary.

The show is not newer than 2003 and probably not older than 98'-99'. It's an absurdist comedy with a team of girls who has pretty much useless powers. One of the powers is, how I remember it, Earth Falldown. She just falls over. 

They do battle against either monsters or aliens and one of the antagonists rise up from the ocean. I also remember wooden poles stuck in the sand at the beach when they do battle. 

Sadly that's about how much I remember. So, as I said. Hail mary.",False,anime,1706733111.0,1afrulm,Help

I'm turning 30 this year and when I was younger I watched a lot more animes than I do now. I liked “old” animes like OG Dragonball, Inuyasha, Cowboy Bebop, and Neon Genesis Evangelion. When I got together with my wife, I got her into anime and we watched Naruto, Sword Art Online and Attack on Titan together. Nowadays, she watches more anime than I do and everytime, she asks me to join her but I can't enjoy for some reason ""newer"" animes like Jujutsu Kaisen or Demon Slayer (her favourites). It feels like I have lost something on the way.. I don't know why but I think it's the newer artstyle of these animes. They look so clean and flawless in contrast to the ""good old, hand drawn"" animes. However, I wanna do my wife a favour and watch a show with her together.

It starts out at the base of a cliff like shore, with someone selling guns (maybe illegally). Then the main character somehow ends up on an island where he befriends a little girl, and he realizes something is wrong with how the island is ran. Something he finds weird is that there are no animal noises on the island, and no pets anywhere. He finds his way out to a forest on the island where there are living plants (they reminded me of mandrake roots from HP).

My journey in Anime so far,"So far I have watched anime series like Demon Slayer, Romantic Killer, My happy marriage, Chainsaw Man, Naruto and movies Spirited Away, Howls moving castle, Arietty, Ponyo, basically all the Studio Ghibli ones.

I fell in love with Demon Slayer. The characters and the story line were very interesting. Each fight interesting techniques and each Demon backstop was very moving. The other series that I loved was Romantic Killer. I was hooked right from episode 1. Other than these 2 anime series, I couldn't find other series that are as interesting.

No offense to any fans, but Chainsaw Man was bad. There were no techniques or anything interesting in the fights. There was nothing particularly moving, and no character was worth remembering IMHO. I started Jujutsu Kaisen and I was basically forcing myself to get through till the 9th episode. Again, the fights weren't interesting, no scene in all the 9 episdes kept me to the edge of my seat.

Love is war is another anime that is supposed to be really great. But man, it was too cringe and bad that I couldn't make it past the 2nd episode.

Is it just me or are there others who also feel the same way? I really got into anime after Demon Slayer. I kept searching for other acclaimed anime to watch but I keep getting disappointed on watching them. 

So far the only anime I have LOVED is Demon slayer, Romantic killer. And all the Studio Ghibli movies <3

Anime recommendations for someone in need,"Hi, I'm looking for a new anime to watch and I have this vibe I'm looking for but I have no idea what I'm looking for. I'm interested in watching an anime that's a little grungy, medium pace that has a bit of a plot to it and not very slice of life but a little soft like one but a little bit of something extra that happens in the universe. Maybe a little bit artsy in a way, more mature in nature but not a lot of fan service and not isekai. kinda thinking along the lines of something similar to Air gear, Bleach, Durarara!!, Blast of the tempest, Bungo Stray Dogs, Tokyo Goul, Blood Blockade, Noragami, The Unlimited Hyobu Kyosuke, Beelzebub and Gangsta.

Any one else notice this common issue with anime?,"I started watching Inuyasha for the first time and was surprised how solid the world building was. After thinking about it it was less that inuyasha had a great setting and more that many anime tend to completely forget about the setting.

I don't know if some one else has a better name for this but i call it ""in a bottle syndrome"". Over time the story of many anime feel more and more like they are in a bottle and not at all part of a bigger setting.

Examples would include when the heros fight the villian for a long time and the rest of the world seems to dissappear until they are done, stories set in modern times where people forget police and hospitals exist until its dramatically convient, or most common of all when you get long running anime were there are almost no extras, as of the important characters all exist in a pocket dimension with other important characters and no one else.

I consider this a problem but its not a deal breaker, there are plenty of shows I have enjoyed that suffer from this. I just really appreciate when the setting is fully realized and reacts to the protagonists.

I never really found cartoons that attractive, I watched things like animated superhero shows with characters like starfire and wonderwoman and I did think they hot but nothing like what I am feeling with anime?

Like the way these ""anime"" characters are drawn somehow entices me? Like their eyes and even hair?  
and its not just their appearance but its also their personalities and voices that somehow entices me?  
out of curiosity I started searching up ""ecchi"" and I found characters like ""rias gremory"" to really captivate me? like the way her body is shaped and detailed, her hair, her eyes, and the way she talks and act really entices me?

sorry about the long body text but I just feel kind of shocked and embarrassed about it. I never felt this way about other animated characters like ""jessica rabbit"" or daphne from scooby doo or any other ""hot"" animated character.  
theres something more charming and attractive about anime girls.  
Like am I turning to a neckbeard?

EDIT: also Why are anime girls so much hotter than other animated characters? Like I never felt this way towards ""jessica rabbit"" or any disney princesses or any video game characters like daisy and princess peach from mario.",False,anime,1706715528.0,1afknlh,Help
Looking for suggestions of a deep/extensive storyline,"I'm really craving a specific type of anime and struggling to scratch the itch.  Looking for something in the vein of FMA/brotherhood and 7 Samurai or Ghost in the shell.

Shonen or Seinen is cool so long as there is a complex storyline with pay off and a lot of purpose.  Character development is really important too. 

I'd like something dark and brooding but small comedy elements are welcome as long as they're minimal.  

Not to be too specific but either a realistic outdoor setting or a dystopian metropolis setting would be best.  More on the drama/horror/sci fi side than the fantasy side but I'm open to suggestions.  

Looking forward to hearing what you suggest.",False,anime,1706714499.0,1afk9kh,What to Watch?

Send me an anime that changed how you think," I want to fall in love with watching anime again. I'm looking for anime recommendations that stuck with you, ones that you watched five or ten years ago and still think about to this day, or even ones you watched recently that just blew you away in a way you're sure you won't soon forget.

Desperately Looking for Anime Recommendations,"Hey Anime Family! I was hoping some of you could help me out here, I'm a huge anime lover just like all of you, my tastes range from Isekai, Romantic Comedy, Slice Of Life, Heart Warming, Feel Good, Adventure, Reverse Isekai, Shonen, Harem, Parody and many others but I think those are the biggest for me. The thing is in my real life I suffer from chronic anxiety and depression and in that regard Anime is like a double edged sword to me. When I find a good anime that I enjoy it genuinely helps me, I'm the kind of person who feels everything our favorite protagonists feel when they feel it. 

Whether that be happiness, sadness, anger, world ending terror and everything in between, I'm going through it with them and I enjoy that while I'm watching it because it genuinely distracts me from how depressed I am in my own life I should add that I prefer to stay away from depressing themed animes that have too much suffering or sadness in them, I can deal with some, but for one instance, I'm torn on Re:Zero Starting Life In Another World. The reason why is because the characters, the story, the world building is AMAZING and its one of my favorite animes hands down. However, the depressing apsects if it are genuinely bad for my mental health, it makes me so unbelievably depressed that at times I wish I never got invested in it because now it's too late and I have to suffer as they suffer because I love them. 

Another thing I'd like to add is that it KILLS me when an anime I get into gets canceled or rather in the anime world the forever unknown because they never actually cancel it, we just never hear anything else about it andnwe go on forever hoping it'll get picked up for another season even though most likely it won't, apart from some rare cases like ""The Devil Is A Part Timer!"" Man I was so happy when that got a new 2 cour season even though it was soo many years later. When the anime is left unfinished it breaks my heart and it never leaves my mind which nowadays just seems like the norm unfortunately because as we all know Animes are just a way to get more people to buy the light novel and / or manga. 

So all of that being said (and I'm really sorry this post got away from me and got so long) I'm looking for recommendations for some great anime that are already completed (not canceled) and had a proper ending or its close to being completed (last season coming soon, or so insanely popular there's no way it won't air to completion). SOME of the many animes I've seen and loved (and yes I know some of these haven't finished airing and might not finish and it breaks me, sometimes when I run out of anime to watch I get anxious and have to pick one that's still ongoing, unfortunately for me)

If you guys can help me out with some recommendations based on this list and even if it's something different, if you think it's a good anime, and it has a proper conclusion, the anime finished without being canceled, please throw it my way! I really do appreciate your help everyone thank you so much and I realize this is a long post and goes into a few different issues I have personally so I would really appreciate it if nobody would pick on me for that. Thanks again everyone! 

Animes I've seen and genres I like:

- Isekai
- Romantic/Comedy
- Comedy
- Slice Of Life
- Feel Good
- Heart Warming
- Adventure 
- Reverse Isekai
- Shonen
- Harem

That's the main thing I remember, this robot could turn it's arm up and bring some guns from it's elbows... Also I kinda remember it had only one red eye and one companion... But this part is kinda blurry.

Gundam Witch From Mercury S1 Episode 8 thoughts,"Ik this aired like a year ago, but I was just watching it for the first time when I got this horrendous realization, and I needed to talk about it. Suletta isn't just a pseudonym for Eri so they could avoid the council. Suletta is a new daughter, or maybe a clone of some sort like Erlan was, and Eri was made into Ariel. It just makes too much sense. Eri was 4 years old in the prologue, and Suletta is 17 now, but they say the Vanadis incident was over 20 years ago. It makes no sense unless Suletta was born after Eri was. 

And look how hard Suletta & her mom are pushing the fact that Ariel is family to them. Suletta probably doesn't know it yet, but was taught to think of Ariel as a sister because the Mom wanted them to still have a connection. Also, think about what they said a Gundam was. It's the fusion between man and machine. What better way to fuse them than to literally combine them into one? That's why there's no burden on the pilot of Ariel when they do the Permet thing. The Gundam itself is taking on the burden so the pilot doesn't have to. And remember how Suletta's mom said that they definitely couldn't mass-produce Ariels? It's because it requires the sacrifice of someone with a very strong affinity for the Gundam.

Last and final point, look at the fucking names. Ariel? Eri? Coincidence? I think not.",False,anime,1706689645.0,1afd6e7,Discussion

He starts spinning and spinning until his arms fully wrap around his body and that’s where my memory stops.

This was from when I was very young and I’m now 27 so forgive me if I have very little to go on.

Looking for anime where the Protag gives up like Dreaming Boy is a Realist,"I've been watching Dreaming Boy is a Realist and really enjoyed it. Giving up on your long held hopes and kinda moving on with life a day at a time is a whole mood I synch with. And I like how most of the characters are provoked into the plot of the series not by anyone doing anything, but by the effect of seeing this one guy they thought they knew.... not doing anything wierd or over the top for a change.

I think I'd like to watch something else with a similar premise.... but I don't know not if it's too cynical like that anime with the children's show host who sings and tells children things that are way too cynical adult hot takes with a fake smile on his face. I want to watch stuff that feels kind of fun and witty like Dreaming Boy is a Realist, but also feels like it has that quiet slightly sad but also liberating acceptance that comes from giving up on something impractical.

My take on the Japanese Anime Localisation Controversy.,"（ちょっとしたタイプミスを直した）  
  
I watch anime in both Japanese and English, and I can tell you how shockingly different the shit is.

Yes, translations cannot be 1:1, but these localizers used that as an excuse to justify disproportionate translations of 1 million : 1, by inserting certain quips and slang that removes all context of cultural relativism and the original consciousness of the Japanese material, and those quips and slangs are from the perspective of mainly US/UK audiences, while totally ignoring the fact that other countries SPEAK ENGLISH too.

To be fair, allow me to also bring up bad localisations from the Japanese side with American material, such as the Last of Us video game. In the original English scene when Joel responded with ""Like hell you do"" in response to Tess's remarks about how she knew where the goods are, the Japanese version of this has been localised to　 ""ほんとか？どこだ？"" - which translates to ""Really? Where?"". While this somewhat fits the scene without breaking any narrative of the game, it completely removes the consciousness of the original Joel's character and the remark ""Like hell you do"" was supposed to be a form of sarcasm of sorts, a display of disbelieve while at the same time could very well be expecting the other person to spill the rest of the beans.

With this in mind, Japanese anime fans wanted the same thing, that is:

Do your very best to not remove the Japanese consciousness that exists within a material by trying to ""improve the line"" or ""make sense to the target audience"". Your target audience is the whole, fucking globe of the world, with many other countries speaking universal English that many do not even understand certain slang and quips such as ""mid"". Your attempt to make it more ""gyaru"" merely makes the character likely to be more ""californian"", and that removes the consciousness of the part of the gyaru that is still Japanese.

To bring things into better perspective, imagine every single catchphrase in every single English movie and media being localised into Japanese where the familiar humour is gone, many Japanese localisations do not do a great work to capture the same American consciousness from American movies, for example. Similarly, do not bring in American humour into Japanese material where such zany, verbose expressions of humour do not exists in the general Japanese consciousness where sarcasm is usually involved. Japanese have sarcasm, but it is normally not used to express comedy similarly like the ones you hear in America.

Speaking to you as a person who watches anime in both languages, and the English ones are really bad to bring in ""patriarchy"" where the material has none, or how ""tsundere"" is localised as a ""fragile male ego"" by moralising how a person must be going on in their heads in moments of ""tsundereness"", when in fact ""tsundere"" is merely used as a pop-culture identifier, not as an actual pop-psychology method to actually tell if their egos, male or female otherwise, are indeed fragile or not.

You can in fact, in reality, have a stable ego while still being tsun, so the dogma of localisers patting themselves on the back of this is truly ignorant and disgusting, especially when you learn that some of these localisers don't even speak Japanese, which makes me wonder if they even understood the material CULTURALLY and SUB-CONSCIOUSLY to even think it is not the form of the audacity of the highest order to think you could localise Japanese material by ""making it American"" with reasons such as ""the English have better flow"" or the English one has better humour"", all without realising that you are judging them within the eyes of your own American lenses of what the ""better"" here even is, completely disregarding the Japanese consciousness, and worse, completely disregarding the REST OF THE CIVILISED WORLD who also speaks English, but do not actually speak nor understand any of the quips and sense of American humour.",False,anime,1706666834.0,1af6cce,Discussion

Might be a long shot but does anyone recognize a scene I remember?

I think it was a city at night and someone was fighting something huge / powerful but I don't know if it was very visible? I don't really remember what it was. Something big and round in the sky maybe?   
The person fighting might have been magical, it's a bit fuzzy. One of the main pieces I remember was a train being launched at the bad thing. I don't think it worked, it might have thrown it back. 

The whole scene might have been a vision, or time travel? I remember it being quite depressing and dark, most of the city was destroyed by the end. I had a look around and Madoka Magica looked promising but I couldn't find anything after looking at some synopses . I haven't actually seen it though, so maybe I just missed it.

It was probably on Australian tv, ABC 3 specifically, 8-10 years ago. I don't think I would have seen it anywhere else.

Some anime I’ve watched in the past are: Death Note, One Outs, Toriko, The time I got reincarnated as a Slime, Eyeshield 21, Black Butler, Bungo Stray Dogs, Grand Blue, GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka, The God of Highschool, Kengan Ashura, Nanbaka , Soul Eater, Fire Force, Grappler Baki",False,anime,1706652123.0,1af0r15,What to Watch?
Mobile Suit Gundam SEED MSV Astray: The introduction of the most bought gunpla kits,"MSVs (Mobile Suit Variations) always get the short end of the stick when it comes to recognition. They might get lucky and get a handful of model kits or at most appear as a cameo in a build anime. Hence why I always found it ironic that both the Astray Red Frame & Blue Frame are as popular as they are, since they only appear in these shorts. These 2 episodes are 5 minute shorts that expand on the universe of the Cosmic Era. Anime with a short run time always get over hated since they're really quick. That's what a lot about say about Gundam Breaker Battlouge (even though I thought it was a fun little series). So are these 2 worth watching or not?

* Plot: 
   * Both episodes have a vastly different plot from one another. There's not a whole lot I can say, and explain these in like 2 minutes. In Red Frame; The Junk Guild goes to Earth to an auction to buy parts for their Astray Red Frame. However, they're forced to fight after encountering a couple ZAFT soldiers. As for Blue Frame; While a fight with the Earth Alliance is happening outside, The Serpent Tail are trying to capture a GINN in an abandoned space base. 
   * These 2 episodes aren't really anything special narrativily speaking, as they're by the books and are focused on quick Mecha action. And for 2 episodes with 5 minutes of runtime, can they really do anything more? Overall nothing special to call it good or bad writing.
* Characters: 
   * The short runtime also affects the writing of the characters, as they don't have much to work with. They're not necessarily bad, but they're not necessarily “memorable”. I can easily define them in one personality trait. In the Junk Guild; Kisato is the little sister of the group (and luckily the less annoying kind), Liam is the weirdo, and the Professor is the sex figure with glasses. Not much of a diverse group. 
   * The only one with actual personality is definitely Lowe Gule. He's carefree & easygoing, making him a pretty likable guy. I also do like that the no kill rule applies for him because he's pretty trusting towards others. So ya, Klein is the best guy in the group (I guarantee one of you will understand that reference). As for the Serpent Tail; I can really say too much since they all feel like the same character. There's barely any differing traits that separates them from one another outside of their looks. So overall, Lowe is basically the only one of these characters that's worth talking about.
* World building: 
   * Okay, now let's talk about the best part about these episodes (or mainly Red Frame), the world building. The way they expanded upon the Cosmic Era is great and it shows its unique traits. Auctions are like car shows, but for mobile suits, the Junk Guild are basically a maintenance & Salvaging team, and the Serpent Tail are a mercenary group that'll take on any job. This adds more intrigue into the lore of the Cosmic Era & gives it more personality. 
   * My only gripe is how they never explained how currency even works here. When Lowe bought a BuGUE's head, he spent a million “Earth Dollars”. Makes me wonder if this is the universal currency on earth or there's other types of currency. Now that I think about it, currency is never really explained in the franchise. They never explained that part in any of the entries and just wrote it off as “Colony/Earth Dollars”. Props to After War Gundam X for at least trying to show us how their currency exchange works. Overall, I think the world building was done pretty well here.
* Mobile Suits: 
   * With SEED having such an expansive roaster of mobile suits, this OVA still has a fair amount of those. While smaller, it still has both familiar faces along with some redesigns. But let's get this out of the way, both the Strike Dagger, CGUE, & GuAIZ reappear in this OVA. But they merely serve as cannon fodder. 
   * But we're here for the main attraction, the Astray Red Frame & Blue Frame. Starting with the Red Frame, it always found its popularity kinda ironic since this is its only appearance in any form of animation in SEED. Even its loadout is pretty different from what we usually see. In the OVA, it just has a flight pack, a BuCUE’s head with dual beam sabers & its Gerbera Straight Katana. In lore, it also uses the standard stuff (head vulcans, a shield, a pair of vulcans, and a beam rifle). And yet the master grades always has it with 3 medium gun swords or a bigger sword to make Guts piss his pants. But that last part was for our next Astray, the Blue Frame Second L. Same standard loadout of the original, but in the OVA, it uses said giant sword, the Tactical Arms. This thing can serve as a flight pack, a Gatling gun turret, & you guys guessed it, a big ass sword. Both Frames are pretty good, as they have their own style to them. 
   * As for the other units, It was nice to see different variations of mobile suits we know. The CGUE DEEP Arms was an interesting take on the regular CGUE with its thermal energy cannon & Heavy laser sword. Its also a nice attention to detail to see the cannon have real heat problems, and its nice that it’s actually addressed. We also see the GINN High Maneuver type, but it doesn’t have much outside of just stealing those GN Drives from 00 (Which is weird to say since this came out 1st). The BuCUE Tactical Reconnaissance Type does appear too, but as I mentioned earlier, its head is just used as a double beam saber for the Astray. There’s also Eijiah’s GINN that doesn’t do a damn thing in the anime. And finally we have the Sword Calamity, which just replaces the original Calamity’s back cannons with dual swords. It’s definitely a cool looking machine and probably is a fully capable machine, and it appears only once and never again. Welp, if you want to experience this Gundam in all of its glory, dust off that PS Vita & play the SEED Battle Destiny. I
   * ts nice to see these MSV get the animated spotlight for a change and see them in their full glory. We need more MSVs in anime since not a whole lot of people really know about these designs. And it's such a shame too, since some of them have some really interesting backstories of either being attempted mass-produced versions of existing mobile suits or armored up/upgraded or tuned versions of some. The closest you’ll get is getting to play as these suits in some of the games or even a whole kit with reused parts, if your lucky.
* Verdict: 
   * I haven’t written a review this short since Twilight Axis. But unlike that trainwreck of an OVA, MSV Astray does a better job with what it's given. It may not be much in terms of story or even characters. But it does expand on the Cosmic Era a little and adds some really good designs. At the very least it’s worth watching for the mecha action. All I can say, is that this OVA is the calm before the storm. And oh boy, a storm is coming for the Cosmic Era.",False,anime,1706651927.0,1af0o0g,Discussion

Frieren is turning into a cultural phenomenon in Japan,"Frieren's has been a monster on the r/anime weekly engagement rankings and a popular topic of discussions, but I'm not sure fans of the series outside of Japan realize just how much of a cultural phenomenon Frieren's become IN Japan.

First off, the sales of the Freiren manga has jumped into a different stratosphere since the start of the anime.   The manga was already a big hit with 10M volumes sold before the anime started, from April 2020 \~ Sept. 2023. 10M sold is a large enough number [that some manga websites in Japan](https://manba.co.jp/keyword_tags/1906) use it as a benchmark for what's considered a ""hit"" manga you can filter for.

Over the course of 3.5 years, 10M volumes sold.  But that was before the anime.

In just 2 months after the anime started, the manga sold SEVEN MILLION more copies during Nov/Dec 2023.

[https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2023-12-04/frieren-manga-adds-7-million-copies-to-circulation-in-2-months-since-anime-premiere/.205063](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2023-12-04/frieren-manga-adds-7-million-copies-to-circulation-in-2-months-since-anime-premiere/.205063)

Even at over 3M copies per month being sold, Frieren is a long way away from cracking the top 20 list of [best selling manga of all time](https://www.cbr.com/best-selling-manga-how-many-copies/#naruto-masashi-kishimoto), but the anime is launching the manga into the rarified sales pace of smash hit manga that every Japanese person can easily recognize.

Moreover, Frieren's cultural influence in Japan is jumping into the mainstream.

The phrase 勇者ヒンメルならそうした (The Hero Himmel would have done so) is [a manga/anime meme](https://togetter.com/li/2246854?page=2) that's made the jump into Japanese mainstream culture. It's gotten the name ヒンメル理論 (Himmel logic) where you point out the right/noble thing to do saying this is what Himmel would have done.

A parent [shared a funny story](https://togetter.com/li/2246854?page=2) where their elementary school child didn't want to do their homework and in exasperation, he said ""This is what Himmel would have done"" and the kid was like ""That's true"" and did it. There are multiple groups on social media [devoted to the meme](https://yuusha-hinmeru-nara.quora.com/).  A search for[ヒンメルなら (Himmel would have)](https://twitter.com/search?q=%E3%83%92%E3%83%B3%E3%83%A1%E3%83%AB%E3%81%AA%E3%82%89&src=typed_query&f=top) on twitter (X) pulls up thousands of tweets with people's twists on the phrase.

Frieren's being pulled into crossover advertising campaigns.  Japanese fans were amused when a crossover collaboration between Frieren and Beyblade (a line of spinning top toys popular with younger kids) was announced.

[https://togetter.com/li/2246187](https://togetter.com/li/2246187)

The logic of Frieren ""discovering"" Beyblades was Frieren wanted to learn more about humans... then learned that humans like playing with Beyblades (which cracked up Japanese fans leading to jokes about Frieren discovering just about anything)

It just feels like Frieren is definitely hitting another gear in terms of public consciousness in Japan.  It was already well known among manga fans after it won the reader-voted [Manga Taisho award in 2021](https://www.mangataisho.com/archives/2021.html) over strong contenders like ""Chi"" and ""Oshi no ko"" and ""Monster No. 8,"" but it feels like Frieren is on the trajectory to become something bigger.",False,anime,1706650678.0,1af058d,Discussion

Who would have thought (Shield Hero Post),"I know that this subreddit does not like Shield Hero and that's fine if you don't like it. But as a SH fan myself, I was surprised that a 4th season was announced considering that the popularity of SH has decreased after the disastrous 2nd season from 2 years ago. Yet still, after all the criticisms and hate, it somehow got a 4th season after a improved but ok 3rd season (however, as a LN reader, I was glad that it's much closer to the source material than the first 2 seasons combined). Also, seeing that the Blu Ray sales were pretty low (I think around 500) and the fact that I think the West mostly hates it but it fascinates me on how popular it is with other places outside of Japan.

If there are any SH LN readers in the subreddit, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the announcement and how much they're going to adapt. I hope Kadokawa learns their lesson from the 2nd season that if they want to adapt more volumes, they need more episodes. ",False,anime,1706633276.0,1aesxna,Discussion
Do you enjoy or dislike realism in anime and why?,"I'll preface this by saying this is referring to slice-of-life/romance anime. I had a conversation with someone about how the realism of a specific romance anime I watched felt insanely bland to them and made it boring and seem like it had no driving plot or conflict. I, on the other hand, argued that the realism is what made it such a fulfilling slow burn and provides a sense of grounded comfort. I'm obviously avoiding naming the specific anime to avoid bias.

I personally believe that it really does come down to taste and what you're in the mood for at the moment. There are days where I want to watch something more quirky that is driven by silly tropes for the sake of entertainment, while there are other days that I want to feel more enamored by a plot that isn't over the top or largely glamorous. 

What is your take on realism in SOL/romance? Do you feel that anime should avoid it as this form of media should serve as an escape from reality, or do you think that realism should be embraced to push the plot forward as long as it doesn't sacrifice development?",False,anime,1706633030.0,1aesu09,Discussion

"Which anime that isn't in the ""slice of life"" genre do you think does SOL scenes best?","I'm of the opinion that a show, no matter the genre, lives or dies by its main cast's ability to keep the momentum going even when nothing momentous is happening. For some shows, this just keeps going until they end, putting them squarely in the slice of life genre. But I always appreciate when a show that has a ton going on plot-wise takes some time to let its world and the characters breathe, and the shows that manage to be just as entertaining in these moments tend to become my favorites.

For instance, *The Apothecary Diaries* instantly drew me in last season due to how much I absolutely adore Maomao and her interactions with the rest of the rear palace. Despite how much I vibe with the murder mysteries, I honestly think I enjoy the non-dramatic scenes with Maomao and company even more now (the fact that Aoi Yuuki's range is completely insane doesn't hurt). And judging by the preview for this week's episode, it looks like it'll have more of Maomao and Jinshi just living their lives, so I can't wait!",False,anime,1706631282.0,1aes3va,Discussion

I need my fill of wow,"U kno kurokos basketball, Ahiru no Sora? In both Animes the mc is insanely talented and stuff. 

I NEED MORE

I want to find a sports anime where the mc is already at pro level, like yeah they can struggle but never ever get beat. And if they do then it’s not their fault, it’s the teams fault. 
Anyway, they gotta be at pro lvl but get underestimated all the time cos of their height, figure, personality etc. They’re new to town and whatnot and show everyone what they can do and lead the team to VICTORY. 

Anyway, reference of what I loved like this: 
Sk8 the infinity
That’s it. I basically need another panga but in another sport.
And sport anime I’ve watched:
Haikyuu
Blue lock
Kurokos basketball
Ahiru no sora
Backflip 
Sk8 the infinity 
Stride
That one running anime
And sport anime I’m scared of watching cos of art style or age:
One outs 
Initial d. 
(I don’t spesifically judge on age, just older anime’s have that cringe hair thing. And I’ve been spoiled by mappa for animation.)

I don’t rly care how good the story is. I just need a bunch of arrogant little shts to kneel down to a kid they underestimated. 

Btw, personality wise, they can go from haikyuu mc to ayanakoji the king.

I forgot an anime movie that I had watched,"Long ago I watched an anime movie that I really liked. If possible could someone help me find what it was?

I watched it before 2018.

I remember it being about a girl going back to her home in the countryside(not too sure). She used to live there when she was young. At that time she was friends with the spirits that inhabited the area. Now she is older she doesn’t think the spirits are real and doesn’t really want to go back.

Two scenes I remember :
1 - she is in the car during the start of the movie as she looks out the window she notices weird spirits flying in the sky. Suddenly something happens witch hides the spirits for a few seconds. After that they weren’t there anymore.

2 - a flashback about her as a baby/child climbing up a big tree with multiple spirits cheering her on. As her parents calls for her the spirits gradually disappear. Once her parents find her they talk about how it was impossible for her to be able to get up onto that tree.


I would say that this anime would be categorized as :
-coming of age
-wholesome

What anime have the most creative titles?,"I'm a huge proponent of the idea that a good title can make or break a work or offer some kind of clever insight into the work itself. It's a subtle thing, but I like songs and other pieces with titles that aren't so direct as just copying a lyric or describing the piece and make you think a little. Like a good poster, a good title can also prime our expectations of a work going in.

And to be honest, I think most anime kind of suck at this. I know the whole overly long and descriptive light novel title bit is getting old at this point, but even leaving those aside, the title game isn't great. Not to say that it necessarily distracts from a piece, but a lot of the remaining titles either references the main character (*Frieren, Naruto, Lupin, Baki*, etc.), another major character or entity in the world (*Mobile Suit Gundam, Akira, Pluto, Shiki, Gurren Lagann, etc.*) or a basic part of the world or story (*Amagi Brilliant Park, Hyouka, Land of the Lustrous, Vinland Saga, One Piece, Maison Ikkoku*, etc.). These are fine, but I want to know what titles get really creative.

So what are some titles that really hit you with that ""aha moment"" where it starts to make sense or that make you think ""that's pretty clever""?

Some examples that come to mind are this season's *A Sign of Affection* (a cheeky reference to the MC's hearing condition), *Deca-Dence* (technically another noun title, but one that grows a deeper meeting after some first episode spoiler-y shenanigans), *March Comes in Like a Lion* (a reference to the show's themes of depression and how it too shall pass), *Anohana* (a lot to unpack here, I recommend just looking it up) or more spoiler heavy titles that are the embodiment of the ""those who know vs. those who don't know"" meme like *Girls' Last Tour* and *Your Lie in April*. Special shout out to *Yurikuma Arashi* which literally translates to ""Lesbian Bear Storm"" which is kinda on point.",False,anime,1706627569.0,1aeqnkd,Discussion

Help me find this Anime,I don’t have a picture so I will try to explain as much as I know about that show. It was an episodic Children’s Anime. The main character was a boy living in a neighborhood. The whole premise of the show was that he had a imaginary friend???? It was like a big fluffy and stupid bunny. He had magic abilities. To be honest I don’t really know if he was imaginary. Besides those 2 there were of course other returning characters living in the neighborhood. I don’t remember anyone besides 2 little girls that were twins. Those 2 annoyed the main character if I am not mistaking. Luckily I can remember one episode. That bunny guy traveled thru the human body for some reason and ended up in the head and he traveled with an elevator only to see a lot of ear wax. One thing I know is that it was like around 2015. I saw it on Disney XD but I don’t know if it was in Germany or in Kosovo when I was visiting my family.

Her character draws attention from her classmates and end up being friends with some popular ones, although she doesn't think that way. The animation, too, is preety good in expressing the emotions. P.A. Works did a great job. If you like Slice of Life without heavy emphasis on romance, this is the one.

Insomniacs After School - Romance doesn't always have to be grand,"I just finished watching Insomniacs After School. It would be hard not to sound like a broken record among the other fans who loved the show, but given how much of a hold it had on me, I wanted to get my thoughts out on it and discuss more!

&#x200B;

TLDR: Insomniacs After School feels like the pinnacle of realistic, slow burn, long game romance that is not only adorable to watch unfold, but feels relatable every step of the way.

&#x200B;

As someone who suffers from occasional insomnia (funnily enough turning to romance/romcom anime to kill the time before eventually dozing off), this show couldn't have come at a better time. Immediately from episode 1, Ganta Nakami presents himself as an extremely relatable main character without giving off the cringe ""I hate my life"" or ""I need to be better than everyone else"" spiel. Rather, he is an outwardly off-putting and deeply misunderstood person who can't help but project his previous trauma through his lackadaisical attitude due to his insomnia. Ganta seemingly presents himself to the audience as a somewhat dislikable character for lack of depth that quickly gets answered with a reason to be intrigued by his demeanor.  


Isaki Magari, on the other hand, is seemingly a polar opposite; loud and bubbly in nature, clearly very popular with the rest of her class without having to rely on any type of ""gyaru"" tropes but is genuinely someone that you just can't seem to dislike as she gives no reason to, even if you were to try. Her extroverted nature clashes with Ganta's personality very clearly, which isn't anything new in the world of anime, we see this trope all the time. Two main characters who are seemingly polar opposites but eventually form a deep connection and fall for each other? You might as well be writing the plot to, like, 85% of romance anime out there.

&#x200B;

However, what brings them together is what truly makes their connection unique and weighted with depth. Insomnia is already relatable for a majority of people who watch anime as I'm sure we've all had those sleepless night that we just can't put down a show to continue to watch another episode. But what's so great about insomnia being their ""red string"" here is that it is a constant, realistic reason for these two characters to grow closer to one another. By feeling so helpless in your insomnia, it is no wonder that you naturally grow closer to someone who suffers from the same affliction, knowing that you aren't alone while everyone else around you disappears into their sleep.

&#x200B;

Everything about this show, from its plot to the activities, and even to the conversations had between Ganta and Isaki, can be traced back to their shared insomnia in a way that never falters, there is no reason to believe all of this as just ""anime"" reasoning considering 1 in 3 adults suffer from insomnia symptoms, making this one of the most relatable and realistic main themes that I've seen in an anime. Who wouldn't want to spend those unsleepable hours in the dead of night with someone by their side? It's almost as if you two would be the only ones in the world as everyone around you disappears from the streets and establishments of the world to rest.  


The side characters, who rubbed me the wrong way at first as a flat attempt of adding some world-building, also contain their own depth without stealing the show or being to flashy in their integration.  The relationship between the entire group feels largely organic which is somewhat rare in most anime these days. Granted, what tied most of the group together is Isaki being the glue for most members, Ganta still plays a huge portion in a theme that can also stand to learn a lot from; treat others the way you want to be treated. By extending a hand to everyone he wants to recruit, they feel more than happy to return the favor which ultimately forms a nice group to watch on-screen, even if the reason they got together ended up not happening at the end of it all. What they got out of it was a friend group with a sturdy foundation. Even Motoko Kanikawa, who can arguably be described as the most dislikable character in her introduction, is organically integrated into the group by simply experiencing FOMO and wanting to be part of the fun and center of attention. It's not only in line with her character, but a clever way to add her into the story that feels realistic and natural, and of course we're glad to see that she develops by the end, even if she still has a small chip on her shoulder.

&#x200B;

Lastly, the relationship between Ganta and Isaki grows as naturally as they do. From the beginning to the end, Ganta seems almost unrecognizable in comparison to who he is in episode 13 and who he was in episode 1. What starts off as an avoidant character just looking for any excuse to find some sleep away from everyone else, we see a character who opens up not only to Isaki, but to everyone else in the group when he thought no such notion could be feasible. Isaki, on the other hand, seems to almost have given up on getting any better, despite her outwardly demeanor, to the point where she even hints to dying sometime in the future (thank God that didn't happen, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, mentally preparing). There was a particular scene where Ganta and Isaki are headed to the final photo site where Ganta grabs Isaki's hand as she's running in front of him, saying something along the lines of ""I feel like if I let her go, she'll melt away in this white-hot summer"". I guess to an extent, he was right. Isaki seemed to have hinted at eventually disappearing, but Ganta, with the growth he experienced over the course of the series, developed the strength and the courage to hold on to her, letting her know that she is seen for who she is and what she means to him. The climax of their relationship is probably one of the most natural, organic, and fulfilling confessions I have ever watched in anime. Nothing about it felt rushed, in fact at a certain point I found myself thinking ""Dude, just tell her already!"" but Isaki's insistence on waiting till they reach the finish line made the payload hit that much harder, truly tugging at the stiffest of heart strings.

&#x200B;

Overall, Insomniacs After School firmly cements itself in ""I can't believe I haven't watched this before"". Considering how much I love a wholesome slow burn and the occasional insomnia I suffer from myself, this show seemed right up my alley. However, even if that doesn't seem relatable to you, I couldn't recommend this more to anyone who wants something heartfelt to watch as the themes don't discriminate against those who aren't insomniacs, or night owls, or photographers, or astronomers, etc. There's much to pick up on life as a whole from this show, and I'm so glad I took the time to give it a thorough watch.

Anime like “Our Dating Story”,"I just finished “Our Dating Story: Experienced You and the Inexperienced Me”. I binged 10 episode in one night and just finished the last two, and would love to keep watching, but unfortunately it is only one season. 

Does anyone have recommendations for anime that are similar to “Our Dating Story”?

I started with “Horimiya”, then “More Than a Married Couple, But Not Lovers”, and lastly “Our Dating Story”. 

I would prefer to watch an anime that has good animation and toned down fan service. I think “Our Dating Story” had very well done animation and the fan service was well balanced. When it was shown, the characters did not simply act like perverts, but instead chose to have a committed relationship. I am a few minutes into “My First Girlfriend is a Gal”, and the fan service is already over the top and I will likely stop watching.

“Our Dating Story” is definitely my favorite of the three romance anime that I have seen, and I would go as far as to say it is one of my favorite anime in general. I loved the characters and their devotion to each other as well as their desire to love each other before committing to the act.

Was this anime real or a figment of my imagination??? (Help),"Okay so I was doing my hw just now and suddenly remembered this really old anime that I definitely recall having watched before but when I was LITTLE (like around 5-6) but when I tried searching for it I got no results...

&#x200B;

From what I can remember there's this young, brown haired poor/slave woman that gave birth to two red-haired twins (not ginger I mean actual red) and she was friends with this big cat (either sabertooth or regular lion idk) and not long after they were born he kidnapped the both of them and ran off as the woman chased behind, crying to not take her kids away. Either from guilt or some pain the big cat left only one of the twins behind and took the other to some evil lady.

Few years later the woman is working on some land, on the same land the kidnapped twin happens to be running around there and sees her before being escorted back by some creature thingy. After some time the woman dies and is put in a grave by the twin that was not kidnapped, I remember other kids his age having thrown stones at said grave and he chased them off.

&#x200B;

Next thing I remember is them being adults, the kidnapped twin goes through some ritual (I think) and is struck by lightning, and I believe he then saw who his real mother was (?) or something like that. Skippity skip- he reunites with his twin brother and they save this woman... the kidnapped twin falls in love with her and he and his brother get into an argument. 

&#x200B;

Now the LAST thing I can remember from this: was the kidnapped twin's lover giving birth to this ugly alien looking baby that did something to the world and brought down chaos to it all. And that's it. That's all I got.

Now I know Reddit is full of detectives so I need ya'll to help me figure this out or not, I'd really appreciate it because I can't stop wondering if I'm just delusional or nah-

What did Madoka do to earn Homura’s undying loyalty?,"I’m one of the minority that found Puella Magi just good-ish, and not “best masterpiece 10/10” material in my opinion. 

I’m fairly sure the main focal point of the series is probably how you see the two leads. One of my main questions is what did Madoka do other than simply being friendly and kind with her that prompts Homura to devoting her whole life to this one girl she has known for a few days at most? 

She does save her once from a labyrinth, but that’s also just the duty of a magical girl in the first place. Madoka wasn’t alone either, she was with Mami. So it’s even less personal or intimate than if ONLY Madoka had gone out of her way to protect her. 

My suspension disbelief was broken just though this wild jump in Homura’s behavior. I think a few more episodes could have really helped explain their bond better. More time with showing their friendship growing stronger maybe, and seeing them connect in more than superficial ways. Basically, I think episode 10 felt rushed to a certain point. The backstory seems good on paper, but seeing it play out in story left much to be desired for me. It should work, but we BARELY get to see the stuff in the middle that actually builds their connection.

Looking back at the runtime of ep 10, there are about 6 total minutes between Homura meeting Madoka, and Homura crying over her corpse. Logistically, I should feel more for them  but the condensed and extremely fast pace of the episode makes it kind of hollow for me. I need more than a mere 6 minutes to explain a plot integral relationship to me for it to be believable.

I'm a huge fan of comedies, dark comedies, psychological horror, dramas and thrillers, I also love romances (but obviously I don't mind if the recommendation doesn't include romance).

Need some recommendation on seinen animes,"Hi people, I'm looking something to watch that is outside the shounen sub-genre. I watched Demon Slayer's last season recently, and it was getting on my nerves the fact that you know that the main protagonist or his friends aren't actually in danger, and despite villages and a lot of extras dying, it doesn't really feel like an impact. The main protagonist was always ""omg, I'm so weak"" * cries *, ""I need to protect my sister but I don't have the strength"" * takes strength out of his ass *, ""yay, I killed that bad guy after 5 episodes of me crying and internal dialogue on a technique that I can only use once, but I'll use it again because fuck you"" * monster gets a power up and the cycle repeats for another 5 episodes until the bad guy actually dies *. The bad guy had a rough backstory is a good thing, but it got to a point that's just ridiculous. EVERY ONI WOULD HAVE A TRAGIC BACKSTORY, it was beggining to feel like a punchline to a joke. It's not good anymore, when it gets to a point where you can literally tell what happens in the next episode, and so on. (Sorry for the rant, I know it's a convention on the shounen sub-genre, and the anime is a good shounen take).


I'm looking for animes like more like Paranoia Agent, Perfect Blue, Paprika, Welcome to the NHK, Serial Experiments Lain, Spy X Family (this one is surprisingly well written, while having a good story and character dynamics), Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop, Fullmetal Brotherhood (kinda shounen but things actually happen, matter, and progress in a good way), Fate/zero (this one I watched a long time ago, I remember it touched a few mature themes). 


TLDR: I know it's corny, but I'm looking for more ""deep"" animes, that touch on more complex themes, a more complex narrative and ""makes you think"" a bit more than ""yay, me kill bad guy"".

Which Japanese Artist has the strongest lineup of Anisongs to their credit?,"Minimum I'd say for consideration are 5 songs across different anime

Just some that come to mind

LiSa

* Fate/Zero - Oath Sign
* Sword Art Online - Crossing Field
* Irregular at Magic High School - Rising Hope
* Nisekoi - Rally Go Round
* Demon Slayer - Gurenge

Yoasobi

* Oshi no Ko - Idol
* Frieren - Yuusha
* Gundam Witch From Mercury - Shukufuku
* Beastars - Kaibutsu
* Pokemon Scarlet and Violet - Biri Biri (technically not an anime but anime adjacent)

Man With a Mission

* Log Horizon - Database
* Seven Deadly Sins - Seven Deadly Sings
* Gundam Iron Blooded Orphans - Raise Your Flag
* Inuyashiki - My Hero
* Vinland Saga - Dark Crow

Edit: Glad to see this raised some good discussion! Some clarifying points 

* For me personally I'm looking for both breadth (ie has worked with multiple shows / franchises) and depth (has high quality bangers, bonus points if their songs have transcended their status as ""just"" and OP or ED.) If we were to compare it to sports, I couldn't really call a player a Hall of Fame player just because they have maybe 1-2 really good seasons under their belt, you want to see them having sustained production over a period of time. Likewise, a good ""workhorse"" player who doesn't make mistakes but also doesn't make big plays won't necessarily come to mind if you're asking about who the GOATs of the game are.
* An interesting point I hadn't considered - I was initially thinking mostly about performers (ie singers) but some people brought up composers (Yoko Kanno, Hiroyuki Sawano, Aki Hata) who maybe didn't sing or perform the songs themselves, but contributed to songs in general. I'll leave that up to you if you want to include them in this list, personally I think Composers and creating Soundtracks is a different skill than an OP/ED.
* While I initially asked who had the strongest lineup of Anisongs, one question that I've since been wondering - given that many prolific artists might have a legacy based on quantity (looking at you Mr 1200 songs Ichiro Mizuki), which artists would have the strongest 5 or 10 song lineups of their best songs only? 

Anyway here are the most commonly mentioned ones that I missed with more than one mention - not exhaustive by any means. 

* Aimer (by far the most common)
* Asian Kung Fu Generation
* JAM Project (as a group - of course the members have their own individual songs as well)
* Flow
* ClariS
* TM Revolution
* UVERWorld
* Sayuri
* Nano
* Megumi hayashibara
* Myth and Roid
* Kana Boon
* Spyair
* SiD
* Kalafina 
* Konomi Suzuki
* Masayoshi Ooishi
* Meg Rock",False,anime,1706556721.0,1ae3wzn,Discussion

"kids, anime and ratings"," 

i'm somewhat confused in the wake of the ""death of shojo"" & a few posts asking for recommendations for x aged kids.  
my kid saw me watching aot when she was 7  and i told her she wouldnt understand. she was pretty adamant about  seeing it so i warned her that it might be uncomfortable and watched the  first episode. it took us more than an hour because i had to explain a  lot of concepts. and i had to translate simultaneously.

we  ended up binging the whole thing (2 seasons at that time) in 3 or 4  days and spent most of the time we wetent watching talking about it.

the  list of anime we watched since(5 years) is pretty wild and i gotta say  that she has grown as person and learned english well enough to participate in school competitions without any additional effort. and  she took up volleyball becasue of haikyu!!

by grown as a person i mean gained a lot of understanding in what motivates people, morality etc.

why  do people abide by age restrictions when it is clearly an arbitrary  number that tells you nothing about how your child would react to it. same goes for ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" shows.

ps-  only thing that has ever caused distress was a book she read alone  before bedtime when she was 8. witches by roald dahl. had to fabricate a whole witch lore that provided us with 100% foolproof way of dealing with those pesky hags.",False,anime,1706552497.0,1ae268s,Discussion

"""Fate: Unlimited Blade Works"" Is My Latest Disappointment","2024. The year in which I finally committed myself to watching Fate series.

After some personal research and fellow enthusiast recommendations, I decided to start with Ufotable's remake from 2014. First of all, the animation really popped - it's fantastic! Many recent shows wished they had that level of quality to their presentation. However, that's the full extent of my praise for the show...

1. The soundtrack is decent to good. Has some cool atmospheric tracks but nothing that got my blood pumping. Maybe that's just a symptom of watching the anime 10 years later than I was supposed to, when standards were a bit lower. Still, not really a negative but rather a neutral point - which I decided to point out first, as the rest will be all negative;
2. The artstyle is... odd, to say the least. Facial features look bland (maybe due to how the nose stands out when compared to how the other features are drawn). It's also intriguing how the design of certain secondary characters seemed better to me than the two main characters;
3. The story is not exciting, even as a character-driven tale. The so-called Holy Grail War feels like what you would get if you considered a Battle Royale map, but dropped just 7 players there rather than dozens of them - without some ""cloud of doom"" sense of urgency. The narrative felt like it was shambling forward, without a sense of momentum. A lot was said about life goals, something that was regurgitated over and over again (one specific episode before an important late S2 battle was focused entirely on delivering that message yet again) - this makes the show feel less intelligent as a result, pretending that its themes are deeper and more complex than what they are. The character-related twist was also extremely predictable;
4. The fights are very dull, despite the stellar animation. Most of them were either fast blade clashes without any sense of choreography (like a kid smashing a piece of LEGO against another) or projectile spams. Again, maybe I am spoiled by recent products, but I feel like there was little creativity put into the moves themselves.

As such, I am left with an okay anime that excels in one front, averages on many others and underdelivers on a couple more. It's especially disappointing since it's apparently regarded as one of the finest products of the Fate series - so chances of enjoying the rest are considerably lower.

EDIT: Forgot to mention, under ""Story"" topic: there was an absurd amount of rule-bending in this anime. Things that shouldn't have been possible, suddenly were, for the sake of plot - Servants ignoring Command Spells, power levels going up and down depending on whether they attacked other Servants or Masters, Servant summoning other Servants, mana consumption, resurrections etc.

Looking for a specific kind of romance anime. (Challenge Mode: I've seen 95% of the obvious recommendations!),"Watching a good anime romance is probably one of the most entertaining experiences I've had watching anime. So, I'm looking for some recommendations. Here's what I like - 

1. More comedy than drama. Rom-coms are always fun. Don't get me wrong, SOME drama is ok - Oregairu, Masamune's Revenge, Our Dating Story etc. Just no ""other guy"" business. Basically, don't want NTR crap.

2. The FMC realizes her feelings early on. She doesn't need to be super sure or confess early on. But she knows she feels something and the series is just gonna progressively build on it - Kaguya, Dangers in My Heart, Angel Next Door etc. Basically, don't wanna drag the ""I'm not sure I like him like that"" portion too long.

But I've probably seen most of the obvious recs and that's gonna be a challenge. But still, I'd love to know what you all liked that like this.",False,anime,1706545909.0,1adzfa1,What to Watch?
I don't like Anime but read first....then help?,"Hi, I hope I can make this as detailed and concise.

I am a film and TV addict there isn't much I don't like(apart from romcoms or musicals lawrd lol) but Anime I can't get my head around it. I love animation though I watch ALOT of animated shows and films.

Now I love Studio Ghibli and honestly didn't think it was under the Anime category cus it looked and felt different I thought only sharp drawings and wacky characters were Anime cus they all look kinda the same tbh.

**Reasons**

\- The way it's drawn i really just don't appreciate that sort of art and watching it isn't enjoyable. I do prefer the art of things like Spirited Away, Blue Eye Samurai, Carol and the end of the world, Rick and Morty, Star Trek : Lower Deck, Master of the Universe things like that just more appealing to my eyes. ( I mean I'm someone who watches Cupcake and Dino to go to sleep lol so my art taste is varied)

\- Its just a lot going on and very dramatic and feels like there is no plot sometimes, like the cinematography isn't my fave something seems very anxiety-inducing and not very smooth to process reminds me of trying to watch Pokemon as a kid and just hating it.

\- Colour pallet - the colours are very harsh and don't fit the scenes alot everything is SOOO BRIGHT

\- I find it very wacky that they just talk sooo dramatically like RELAX this isn't a kdrama lol even their expressions its just seems like I can't take it seriously. And I am all for a bit of wild narratives but it feels like there is no downtime.

\- Anime community is the weirdest community I've encountered in the realm of visual media. Every other film/tv fans are happy to really talk about scenes and quotes and the actors but with anime is very much a ""If you know you know"" and i don't care about being part of some cool club i just wanna enjoy film and tv lol

&#x200B;

What I have tried - I have tried many more but these ones I gave a good conscious effort.

\- Now I have tried **Castlevania** as a friend recommended it and we have same tastes. it seems like it would be slow with nice colour pallet and less waky but i honestly couldn't stand the art the way the characters are drawn and considering I love Rick and Morty weird.

\- **Cowboy Bebop,** a few reddit comments mentioned this as its more adult and lawrd bored to death and honestly hated the art but I watched the live-action - it was good enough.

\- I did enjoy **Akira** in the cinema I really liked the cinematography, storyline and what an ending it was a whole experience i still go to the anniversary showings of it cus wow amazing!

\- **Tokyo Ghoul** \- loved the start cus I thought okay wow  never seen anything like this with the blood dripping then it switched to those harsh yellow colours with the boys in the cafe and those sharp lines they use to draw them and immediately put off

\- **Kotaro Lives alone** \- honestly one of my faves the storyline was just 10/10 for me no matter what the art looked like. It reminded me of My life as a Courgette loved it.

\- **Lookism** now this was just a very interesting but random storyline lol it makes me laugh this may be one of the series that i truly enjoyed and laughed a bit  that resembles that sort of classic anime style I don't really like but very dramatic in places but they did have downtime from the wacky facial expressions

&#x200B;

What Id love some help with- with all I said could you recommend some anime where the artwork is different and smoother? I feel like all the reddit comments I see only mention the same 10 animes and i dont like any of them, if there is another corner of this anime world Id love to know-

&#x200B;

\- Looking for :

\- 3 really good films to sink my teeth in with amazing storylines

\- 3 good series I can get into the storyline and characters that have nothing to do with vampires.

\- 3 good ones that are slow and nice to sleep too but none of that pitched cutesy stuff

\- any good LGBTQ ones would be amazing but i don't care about an amazing love story, if it isn't ripping their hearts out with some sort of scandal then leave me out of it

Some things to note:

\- I don't like coming of age stories unless its like the film Belgium 'Close""

\- I don't like stuff set in schools

\- No vampire stuff

\- Love heist films, sci fi, action, psych thriller ( Lady vengeance, Lobster, The Skin I live in vibes)

Thank you!

&#x200B;

**Quick update**\-29th Jan- Thank you soo much for those who have replied! I am coming from a place of open mind and open heart that is why I made my post. ✉️  


Today was the first day I sat down and tried to think why I didn't like anime hence why coming across as ""critical"" but i never thought about it deeply before if I didn't like it I would move on but I wanted to come to this community with some details so I don't waste everyones time just arguing in the comments and wanted to come from a well throughout place.   


Everything that gets recommended today I will take seriously and watch at least 2 episodes of series recommended and 30 mins of a film recommended! I have already started 2 and loving it already so I guess me not liking Anime is slowly wearing off so quickly - just had to find the right genre it seems?

My focus this week will be
- Chainsaw man
- Perfect Blue
- Lupin

 Thanks again people will update on my thoughts on the ones suggested.

What are some people’s favorite romance anime with proper conflict?,"Just felt Iike having such a discussion as I’ve been watching KimiZero sometimes recently, and I wanted to understand why it kind of had a hard time resonating with fans of modern romance anime.




But then I believe it’s because the show doesn’t have a lot of conflict or drama going on as I’ve seen about 5 episodes so far, and from what I’ve seen, don’t get me wrong as I do like the moe aesthetic that it has in its presentation such as Runa Shirakawa’s design, but I feel like the show is playing it a bit safe as again there’s not a lot of conflict going on in the series.





TLDR: I just wanted to understand what makes a solid romance anime such as the stuff that makes people love modern romance series, and I was using KimiZero as an example to understand what people expect in a modern romance show, like if conflict is necessary to establish, although maybe I am wrong about that.",False,anime,1706545231.0,1adz5ml,Discussion
Name of the anime with this plot it’s not called papercraft,"Plot:
Haru is a young girl who stumbles upon a mysterious portal hidden in her attic. Curiosity getting the better of her, she steps through and finds herself in a breathtaking world entirely crafted from paper. The landscape is filled with intricate paper sculptures, towering paper buildings, and vibrant paper forests.

As Haru explores this fantastical realm, she encounters various challenges and puzzles that she must solve to uncover the secrets of the paper world. Along the way, she befriends a diverse cast of characters, including talking animals, sentient origami creatures, and wise paper spirits.

However, Haru soon discovers that the paper world is in peril. An ancient curse threatens to unravel the very fabric of this delicate realm, turning everything into ordinary paper and condemning its inhabitants to a fate of dissolution. With the help of her newfound friends, Haru embarks on a perilous journey to find the source of the curse and save the paper world from destruction.

Themes:
The movie explores themes of creativity, imagination, and the power of friendship. Through Haru's adventures, viewers are reminded of the beauty and fragility of the world around them, as well as the importance of cherishing and preserving the wonders of the imagination.

Animation Style:
The animation style of Papercraft is whimsical and enchanting, with lush, hand-drawn landscapes and characters brought to life through vibrant colors and intricate paper textures. Each scene is meticulously crafted to evoke the tactile sensation of paper, creating a visually stunning and immersive experience for the audience.",False,anime,1706545153.0,1adz4gm,Help

"What do you think of the protagonist of Classroom of the Elite?

Btw, this is all just assumptions, I just want to know if I'm wrong or right about this.

Like he looks like

1. Allergic to emotions or expressions
2. Tries to act cool 24 7
3. Is an asshole
4. is self insert (like those isekai or harem mc type)
5. has a harem for the reasons mentioned above

Please help me remember the name of this anime,"Ok, i saw this anime on a tiktok and for the life of me cant remember the name,

From what i remember the MC is a highschooler who for some reason IDK goes onto the school roof or something similar where he meets a girl, (i assume the love interest) Shes there sleeping, but with a petal on her face. He attempts to take it off her but only ends up waking her up, after a very brief accusation of ""taking a peek"" She says to make it up to her they should skip school and go shopping. the MC has some sort of powers that allow him to see emotions via colours emmited around a person, however this girl who i believe to wear a yellow jumper (school uniform?) doesnt have any colour emitting from her.

&#x200B;

That is about all i can remember, I think the guy has black hair and a standard anime school uniform, while i THINK the girl is wearing a skirt and yellow jumper as the school uniform, I think the girl may be blonde but honestly might be a guess.

Need Guidance on Anime Watching Order – Beginner Looking for Recommendations!,"Hey fellow anime enthusiasts! 👋🏻

I recently got into the anime world and I'm loving it so far. I started with Attack on Titan and now I'm diving into Baki. However, I've got this list of other anime that I'm eager to explore, and I'm looking for some advice on the best order to watch them.

Here's the list I've compiled:

* Attack on Titan (already watched)
* Baki (currently watching)
* Jujutsu Kaisen
* Demon Slayer
* Solo Leveling
* Magic muscles
* Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
* Hunter x Hunter
* Death Note
* Blue Lock

* Vinland Saga
* Chainsaw Man
* Castlevania
* Made in Abyss
* Cowboy Bebop
* Blue Eye Samurai
* Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
* My Hero Academia
* Black Clover
* One Piece

I was thinking of starting from the ones with the least runtime and then moving to the longer ones. Additionally, I'm open to watching Original Video Animations (OVAs), just like I'm currently doing with Baki.

Anyone else tired of the main ship always landing successfully/ be blatantly obvious in Romance/SoL? (Spoilers for ToraDora and Oregairu),"Has anyone ever noticed that whatever character the main hero/heroine interacts with is usually always the one the one they end up with.

Like for example Oregairu's main love triangle ( we all know Iroha was never gonna win ) is interesting because maybe season one/early season two it's kinda of a toss up on Yui and Yukino but like season three any chance of Yui winning was sent to hell to the visual novel alt route devil. Although it makes more sense narrative wise to why Yukino won + it wraps up 8man's character arc but I'd be lying if I said I didn't want Yui to win because I thought they had more on screen chemistry in the earlier seasons.

ToraDora is the biggest culprit of this. Don't give me a character like Ami who's super compelling and interesting when I know it's gonna be a washout near the end of the series because Taiga is essentially the main character of the series.

I'm not saying I hate it completely. Most of the time it makes more sense for the story.

The Fire Hunter - Anime of the Week,"Welcome to the weekly Anime of the Week Discussion Thread! Each week, we're here to discuss various older anime series. Today we are discussing...

## The Fire Hunter

Human civilization no longer revolves around fire, but is instead now driven by fear of it. Repeated wars have changed human biology, and people now spontaneously combust when they get close to natural flame. However, a new source of energy prevents society from complete collapse: a stone-shaped material used to produce light and steam lies within the bodies of monsters that infest numerous forests. Those tasked with collecting this precious resource are called fire hunters.

Touko, a young village girl, is saved from a forest monster by a fire hunter who perishes during his heroic action. After the hunter's dog, Kanata, heals from his own injury, the girl's family sends her to the capital in order to return Kanata and the hunter's fire sickle to his relatives.

Elsewhere, the fire hunter's son, Koushi, and his sister are adopted by a wealthy family. Koushi learns some troubling facts related to the country's ruling royal family. He conducts secret research on a special fire stone found by his late father, kickstarting a race against time between the country's leaders and those trying to save mankind from its ultimate demise.

Hunter X Hunter arc ranking,"Here I go with ranking every Hunter X Hunter arc from worst to best! Specifically from the anime. Time to piss off some Chimera Ant stans lol

1. Greed Island: Everything in this arc just clicked with me. Gon and Killua’s bond with Bisky, the introduction of their Nen abilities, the dodgeball game, and the Greed Island video game itself perfectly shows Ging’s viewpoints on life and gives us insight onto who he is. 10/10 Godsend

2. Heavens Arena: I’m a sucker for tournament based stuff, so this was an immediate hit for me. Gon and Killua had so many badass moments here. 9.5/10 Truly Amazing

3. Yorknew City: Kurapika is a total fucking boss, and the Phantom Troupe is an awesome antagonist group. 9/10 Amazing

4. Chimera Ant: This arc has some flaws that I think some people overlook, particularly Gon and Killua’s sidelining, but the fight scenes were great, I like some of our new allies, Meruem’s great, and the arcs Gon and Killua had were peak, so I can forgive most of my issues. 8.5/10 Fantastic

5. Hunter Exam: An awesome start to an amazing series. Also, Illini fucking sucks! 8/10 Awesome

6. Zoldyak Family: A great five episode arc that helps expand on Killua’s already great character. 7.5/10 Cool

7. Chairman Election: It was okay, but the boring-ass election and Gon being out of commission for most of it kinda threw me off. The manga got lucky due to being able to continue after this. 5/10 Okay",False,anime,1706483572.0,1adg4bk,Discussion

Mawaru Penguindrum Rewatch Interest Thread,"***”Listen, you lowlifes who will never amount to anything.”***

---

Hey guys! I’ve been toying with hosting a rewatch for Penguindrum since basically right after I finished it- It’s a really fun show, compelling in its subject matter, but it also contains incredibly complex symbolism, and without a lot of concentration, it’s very difficult to get what the show is going for. I had a fantastic time with the Utena rewatch I hosted back in 2021, and being that it’s made by the same director, this is a very similar type of show, and it should hopefully produce a similarly enjoyable rewatch experience. 

Additionally, two movies under the name of Re:cycle of the Penguindrum were released in English last year, and I hope to include those in the rewatch as well. I believe they’re mostly recap movies, but they also contain new scenes, and in any case, it should be fun to compare the two.

With the interest I’ve seen already from CDF over the past couple of years, the rewatch is almost certain to happen, but this thread is to gauge how much interest I should expect from the rest of the subreddit. I hope you join us!

**Summary**

Shouma and Kanba Takakura receive the news that their sister Himari has at most a few months left to live. They take her to the aquarium to go see the penguins, but while they’re there Himari collapses, seemingly passing away. However, in the hospital, a miracle occurs- Himari rises from her hospital bed, wearing a novelty penguin hat purchased from the aquarium. But everything has a price, or so the spirit within the hat claims. The show escalates from there.

Penguindrum draws inspiration from the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin attacks. It looks at the lingering trauma of such events, as well as the societal factors and conditions that create them. The show isn't directly about the sarin attacks, but that focus forms the thematic basis of Penguindrum's core motifs alongside works such as Night on the Galactic Railroad. It will be helpful to keep these influences in mind.

Anyone knows the title of this anime?,"Hello. I’ve been looking for years for an anime or Japanese animation I’ve used to watch as a kid. I was watching it in the 2000s, so it is was definitely released before 2010, at least the first episode (I don’t know how many episodes there are or even if there are other episodes as I’ve always been watching the same part).
I have no idea of what the title could be and only vaguely remember a few scenes, so I’ll try to describe what I remember with as many details as possible.

- The main character is a young boy. In a scene in the beginning, he is eating food from a bowl with chopsticks with his family and his father is on the opposite side of the table, reading a newspaper holding it mid-air, covering his face. At some point, the boy hears something that disrupts him and spits the food on his dad’s newspaper.

- in a later scene, the boy is walking in the city, if I remember well along the river. Suddenly, the time freezes, and long, mechanical serpent-dragons piloted by people led by a wicked woman appear. A fight starts and some structures, including tall factory chimneys, are destroyed due to the collision of the dragons on them, and the boy finds himself piloting one of these as well.

- Later, the boy finds himself in a building. We don’t see the outside of the building, but it looks like an industrial style building, mostly made of metal and with metal bridges. It appears to be the evil people that attacked him earlier with the dragons’ lair. They are still led by the wicked woman and are chasing him. At some point, he is trying to escape from them with another girl.

- In the final part, the boy is holding at the edge of one of the metal bridges, trying to avoid falling into the dark and seemingly endless pit beneath him. The girl he was escaping with is leaning above him. At some point, he loses his grip and grabs the girl’s necklace, then falls into the dark.
In the scene right after, the boy crashes through the building’s wall (that for some reason I remember is made of some kind of fabric), miraculously saving himself holding to a bar. He is now outside, and we now see that the building is actually a very tall tower, and he is hovering over the void. It is dawn, and the boy looks at the horizon, seeing other towers. He realizes that he has been transported to another place, maybe another world or dimension. Then the episode ends.

That’s pretty much all I can remember. Some details may be inaccurate, but I hope I gave sufficient clues to find the title of this anime.
Thanks to anyone who can help.",False,anime,1706479571.0,1adek73,Help

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
Hirmuolio has some extra details about the Lain game for us to explore! 
>When the anime Lain was made a the same time a ps1 game Lain was also made.

>The ps1 game is some weird shit made up from disconnected audio logs and video scenes. The story is very different and more disturbing.  

>Here some sort of playthough of it: https://youtu.be/5m5CTaF-qHE?si=zaRFuBR0Frq6QeSm

>Also a short comic for the ps1 game https://e-hentai.org/s/fc548e26b4/1667524-1



 zoospor made [a very in depth comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1acm6bt/comment/kjwqeva) yesterday that I strongly recommend reading all the way through 

Ytar is on team Adorable Bear onesie!! 

> I don't want to admit to the idea that Lain of the Bear Onesie is a ""fake"" Lain. Simple as that. All of her versions seem to be equally fake and equally real. [It's still real to me damn it!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yvd3aEsThbc&t=12s)



Weedwacker gave us an adorable bear onesie explanation~

>The [light](https://imgur.com/abVD0Tj) coming [through](https://imgur.com/OtGYTYl) the [bear pajamas](https://imgur.com/FLVWuNS) is such a beautiful sequence representing Lain coming out of her safety blanket and accepting who she is.

>The idea for the bear pajamas came from the character designer, Takahiro Kishida, and was initially opposed before being incorporated.

>To quote Chiaki Konaka

>> When Lain has to communicate with her family, she wears the pajamas, and she puts on the hat with the bear character when she goes out.  It's like a shield to protect her from the outside world.

* Lain is very much one of those series that you're not expected to *""get""* your first time around. Is there an anime series that comes to mind that you gained an appreciation for long after your initial viewing? 
* What would you say was your favourite episode of the show? Favourite moment? 
* Is there another series you would recommend to fans of Lain if they want more? 
* Please tell me what your favourite Question of the Day has been? Which one gave the most entertaining answers to you? 
* Is Lain literally you fr fr!? 
* Had Lain inspired you to invest in a new animal themed onesie yet? 
* And for our last Question of the Rewatch... Its YOU!! Everybody please nominate their top rewatch member!! Who's comments have you eagerly been refreshing the page to read their thoughts each day and night? Is it Tarhanlindur and his spoiler sense crossovers? Alphie and their consistent efforts to dominate the Abyssbringer corner? Or maybe you want to congratulate RadSuit for somehow managing to finish the rewatch without cracking?

>Lain is fucking dead. She decided that the world was better off without her and ended her own life, dreaming that she could be forgotten so all of the suffering she blamed herself for could be undone. She meets not just *her* father, but *the* father, who lifts her from that purgatorial space she had subjected herself to, believing she deserved it. Lain weeps when her love is recognized because that is all she ever wanted. He tells her that he'll make tea ""next time"" because Lain isn't really gone; she lives on in the hearts and minds of the people that cared about her.

>The only one that sees her is Arisu, whom I already concluded was having some Lain-centric hallucinations last episode, but perhaps she was sent down to get another chance to learn that she truly was loved. Arisu - and any of us, for that matter - can see Lain at any time because we can always remember her and the impact this story had on us. Or we can rewatch the show

##Next Rewatch! 

I've moved this down from the Question of the Day cause it was kinda clogging the whole thing up XD 

So our next rewatch is up in the air... I would like to cover both Haibane and Texhnolyze to complete our trifecta and due to personal interest I will likely host Haibane first. What I would like to ask however is if you'd appreciate a ""palette cleanser"" to help brighten us up? Apparently Haibane isn't as happy and iyashikei as I expected and Lain's a pretty big downer. I have a few possible options for us. We could do I could do [Otome Yokai Zakuro](https://myanimelist.net/anime/8476/Otome_Youkai_Zakuro) which is a softer romance that has a totally stacked VA cast that this rewatch group would appreciate. The last option would be to go straight back to a pure comedy. So Asobi Asobase or Chiyo's School Road. I really don't know tbh... Another possible fun option that's been mentioned a few times is [Kuma Kuma Kuma Kuma Punch](https://youtu.be/WnwcCXr1v7c?si=4sv8DzqdBTjqY2E3) which could satiate this rewatch viewerbase's massive obsession with bear onesie and pyjama parties. I'm happy to do whatever you all like. If you think you can cope with diving straight into Haibane Renmei, please say. I'm happy to host anything you fancy so long as its not about a transgender piss activist

The Sky Crawlers Rewatch Interest Thread,"Hello, r/Anime! Today I’m here to try and commemorate one of the most obscure and underappreciated anime of all time, The Sky Crawlers.

#What is The Sky Crawlers?

The Sky Crawlers was a 2008 film directed by Mamoru Oshii, of Ghost in the Shell fame, and animated at Production IG, adapted from the 2001 novel of the same name. The premise is as follows:

In the near future, where war is waged between corporations, a fighter pilot named Yuichi Kannami transfers to a new airbase called Area 262. However, as he adjusts to his new environment and starts to grow close to his compatriots (especially his commanding officer, Suito Kusanagi), a mystery begins to emerge which might redefine everything both he and the audience knows about themselves and the world.

#Why should I watch it?

The Sky Crawlers is a bizarre yet fascinating film. Despite its premise which might lead you to believe it’s full of warfare and action, the movie is fundamentally a slow-paced, atmospheric thinkpiece. It invites you to indulge in and contemplate the overpowering, ever-present feeling of wrongness and emptiness which is masterfully crafted through its sharp direction and somber soundtrack as the layers of its world and themes unfold before you. And as the plot progresses, all the pieces laid out to you through its presentation begin to fit together and coalesce, creating a clear, impactful critique of society which is just as biting today as it was when the film first released.

But beyond its high-minded philosophy and thick atmosphere, the Sky Crawlers is fundamentally a very grounded, very human story about two people trying to find their place in the world. Both Kannami and Kusanagi are excellently-characterized, with a level of subtle nuance and growth which ties the whole film together.

#Where can I watch it?

The film is available for rent or purchase digitally on [Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.96a9f7b8-852e-a1aa-3354-f7206adde1fd?autoplay=0&ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/movies/details?id=ayn8Akrm93g), [Apple TV](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/the-sky-crawlers/umc.cmc.6hrcpf84uu2dr3xegj4ms2raf?action=play), and [Vudu](https://www.vudu.com/content/browse/details/The-Sky-Crawlers/143317?cmp=OrganicSearch~Vudu~GoogleWatch).

So I want to start on a anime series of my own to form my own thoughts.,Is Dragon Ball z a good show to start watching. That’s the only anime I could really get into since I’m buying the video game. I might take suggestion if you guys have any one that would be better to start with. Thank you guys for helping.,False,anime,1706472513.0,1adbqf9,What to Watch?
Berserk like anime suggestions,"I just finished the 1997 berserk and it was awesome, then tried to go watch the newer Berserk and omg that animation was shocking, I couldn't get into it.
Probably gonna buy the manga and finish the series that way, but in the meantime does anyone have any suggestions for anime's like berserk with a good revenge arc? I loved the art of berserk '97 and the way It set up an amazing revenge arc.",False,anime,1706471855.0,1adbgym,What to Watch?

Chat Gippty failed me. Can you help?,"I'm new to Anime and have a Crunchyroll subscription. I tried asking Chat Gippity for a recommendation on what to watch next but I wasn't satisfied with the answer. I've watched the following animes so far:

Absolute Favorites:

* Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation
   * The first anime and Isekai I watched. It has been hard to find one I like more. I really enjoy the story, the magic system, the character growth, just everything about it.
* ReLife
   * I'm a sucker for some romance and the characters being adults (although still in a highschool setting) I found interesting. The last few episodes was a roller coaster of emotions.
* Re:Zero
   * My second favorite Isekai. I found the character's development to be good, although very painful, in the end was very rewarding. I appreciate some of the psychological horror aspects.
* To Your Eternity
   * This one really made me emotional. I appreciate anime that can really move me, and this one definitely did. Lots of bitter sweetness in this one.

Runner up Favorites:

* Spy x Family
   * This one is just super cute and I love how wholesome it is.
* Kaguya-Sama: Love is War
   * This was the first romance anime I watched and it set a high bar. I enjoyed the slow burn and the absolute comedy that was the narrator. It really was quite cute.
* Your lie in April
   * Like with To Your Eternity, this was a tear jerker for sure. I do like the bitter sweet ones. It almost has some Omori (the game) vibes to it.
* The Quintessential Quintuplets
   * I was in a harem kick for a bit and this one came up, and was not what I expected. I loved the 5 way tug of war and in the end felt satisfied with the result.
* Code Geass
   * From the first episode this one was both a brutal and captivating anime. The action and the emotional turmoil was top notch.

Pretty Good Ones:

* The World God Only Knows
   * I loved how this one poked fun at a lot of tropes. Very fun watch.
* High-school DxD
   * Loved the story and character building, and of course the ecchi elements.
* Toradora!
   * Romance wise I thought this one was cute, though I felt the ending was kinda meh.
* Hyouka
   * Again romance themed, I thought this one was fun, especially the mystery almost Scooby Doo elements.
* Kill la Kill
   * I just love how unhinged this anime was. I felt like someone put the story in a rocket and has it do laps in orbit.

Alright Ones:

* Your Name
   * A pretty good romance anime movie. It was a bit predictable, but not in a bad way.

Meh Ones:

* Paranoia Agent
   * I had really hoped this one would have been better. The story was relatively interesting but the ending had me wishing there was something more/different.
* Shuffle!
   * Like with Paranoia Agent it was really strong at first and then just kind fell off at the last few episodes.
* How Not To Summon A Demon Lord
   * I was in a harem ecchi kick and I thought this one would be good, but I just felt the story wasn't that great.

Given this list, and that I only have a Crunchyroll subscription, what would you recommend I watch next?

The Supernatural Battles show looks very interesting,"I mean sure I haven’t seen too much of aside from the “I don’t understand it” moment, but it’s just that I recall like it was yesterday when it was still a fairly recent anime in general.




I mean sure I should just go see it as it’s done by Studio Trigger themselves, but my concern is that I don’t know how much of the novels it covers, but I guess what I am trying to get at is that the show is fascinating to look back for its somewhat dark nature.




Like again even though that “I don’t understand” moment is basically all I know about the show, my point is that to me it’s quite fascinating how a modern anime series can pull off such a tone shift as back then, it seemed that viewers were expecting a standard moe based fantasy when it first came out, but it seems that particular moment really caught viewers off guard as it was pretty jarring due to the aforementioned dark tones that episode had.",False,anime,1706470525.0,1adaxys,Help

# IMPORTANT NOTICE:

I watched and read the Semi-final and the Very Final ahead of schedule and I am going to say, that ***I STRONGLY RECOMMEND*** to read chapters 687-698 after finishing the Semi-Final OVAs ***because*** those two OVA episodes are abridged version of those chapters and besides of leaving out some jokes like [the girls torturing Hijikata, and leaving him in a state of Post Mayo Clarity](https://imgur.com/a/TohpEZg), Semi-Final OVAs left out an important scenes with Takasugi and Katsura, that are crucial to the Very Final Movie.

*(Although the Movie will very briefly mention what they were doing during Semi-Final with a sentence or two.)*

Plus Chapter 691 wasn’t adapted at all.

If you won’t read chapters 687-698 before watching the Very Final, you can read the summary of what was omitted from the adaptation of the Semi-Final OVAs in my comment during next Sunday.

**Regarding spoilers:**

Rewatchers please don't talk without using spoiler tags \[Spoilers\] >!like this about events which still didn't happen in anime, don't name characters that weren't introduced yet, don't post pictures of characters yet to be introduced, and try to refrain from using arcs and episodes names yet to be introduced.!<

*DON'T EVEN TRY TO BE VAGUE THINKING YOU ARE SO CLEVER AND NO ONE WILL CONNECT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER LIKE SAYING IT WOULD BE A SHAME IF YOUR LOCAL POST OFFICE SENT YOU A BOMBASTIC LIST. JUST. USE. SPOILERS TAGS. LIKE THIS* \[Spoilers\] >!https://i.imgur.com/nojEEcg.png!<

There will be first timers discussing it together with us and I believe nobody here wants them to be spoiled.

"What Have You Watched This Past Week That is NOT a Currently Airing Show? [January 28th, 2023]","Title says it all - talk about the anime you watched this past week that are not a part of this Winter 2024 season (like **Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun 2nd Stage** or **Dungeon Meshi**), or a show that's continuing from previous seasons (like **Sousou no Frieren**).

With regards to Fall 2023 shows, however, it would be fine to write about them as long as you only began them after they finished airing. For example, it's fine to talk about watching **The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You** or **Arknights: Perish in Frost** if you started them after the final episode aired. Obviously, use your best judgement on this.

**Please use spoiler tags**; it's super simple stuff. An example below:

        [KonoSuba Ep 9] >!""THIS WAS A VERY BAD EPISODE, DARKNESS DID NOT DESERVE THAT!<

comes out to be [KonoSuba Ep 9] >!""THIS WAS A VERY BAD EPISODE, DARKNESS DID NOT DESERVE THAT!<

What is the meaning of black swords that often can be seen as an important sign in anime/manga?,"Tanjiro’s sword from Demon slayer, Mihawk’s sword Yoru (meaning dark) which is the strongest sword in the world and Ichigo’s Zanpakuto are all black swords, that belong to important very strong characters. In one piece it is said that a lot of will power/ambition spirit or whatever is the exact translation of Haki can turn a sword black. In Demon slayer it is said that black swords are rare (and again it’s no other than the owner of the sword himself that  turned it black) and in Bleach ichigo is the blade and the blade is ichigo and it is as dark as void and in his bankai form he is dressed in black just like his surname Kurosaki (black cape) suggests. Whatever the case it is always hinted that black swords are strong or important, but what do they symbolise? Is their meaning destruction, strength or maybe even discipline?

What is a good anime to watch with no weight to it?,"I want to watch an anime that is honestly kinda ""pointless."" Something that doesn't have any real plot and I can kinda just watch whenever I want. Something that doesn't make me feel the dire weight of the dire ongoing plot of the show.

I did see an anime like this once, and it is now my favorite. It is called Nichijou. So👏good👏.

Thanks!",False,anime,1706455774.0,1ad5483,What to Watch?

Stuff like bandersnatch, cat burgular, or the newly Netflix interactive series choose love. 

It's something getting explored a bit more but it's still super obscure I'd say. So I thought, what if an anime had choices and you take the helm of someone who's a complete Joe shmoe. A character that is you but you make choices in a world that isn't through cgs like visual novels. Rather a moving world through animation and choices can make the viewer experiment what path, people, and things happen within the story.

Naruto would be hard if your not from the leaf, otherwise your fine because the leaf is stacked

Bleach is kinda safe oddly enough for regular people, the soul society does a good job hiding battles.

I prefer the more 'soul eater' style of the manga since I love the art the mangaka has done

"Looking for a specific anime, thank you!","I'm hoping I'm doing this correctly and whee I need to, if not feel free to remove. I'm looking for an anime that I watched several years ago, around the 2000s. So the main character is a teenage guy who's living in a rather remote village, one day a girl (At least I think it was a girl) drops in because she's been looking for the legendary weapons of the heroes. Some more stuff happens but then I remember he summoned one of the weapons, as the heroes left all their weapons to him, and fights against a demon with it. Then some stuff happens where the demon lord (Or their ranking official) and then they fight in a few episodes. I think (Heavy emphasis on think) that it was only one season with around 24 episodes and he had weapons like a sword, a bow, a spear and more (I think there was around 5-10, somewhere in that range). It's an older anime so I'm hoping someone will know about it because I want to watch it again. Thank you for your time and help!",False,anime,1706419785.0,1acv97x,Help

"Best Valentine's Day Episode in Anime for you, and did you ever get inspired to try something similar?","Since we have quite a good Valentine's day episode today (Boku Yabai / Danger in my Heart S2), and the day is only a little more than a fortnight away, this gave me the idea of the community service of ""think back on the Valentine's day episodes you watched and did you learn anything to apply in your life?""

Just on top of my head, the very best episode of Valentine's day sadly hasn't been actually adapted yet (Haruhi), but in the Haruhi-chan parody it's got a fairly [funny version](https://youtu.be/WNqeHRrMXLQ) as a [2 parter](https://youtu.be/BT1SJ6Md_Gk).

The Nagato spin off also had a really nice arc that culminated to a [little gag](https://imgur.com/DMM011T) of [status quo](https://imgur.com/a/zduQS4H).

Komi-san had a pretty nice episode (but I think was marred by a significant production value drop) that has a really rewarding scene that was earned through the almost 2 seasons.

Going back much further, Kimagure Orange Road had a bit of a chaotic episode, but the end scene was so very nice and again earned.

Paranoia Agent 20th Anniversary Rewatch one week reminder,"Hey, guys. Holofan4life here. 

I am pleased to announce that I will be hosting the 20th anniversary rewatch of Paranoia Agent

##What is Paranoia Agent about?

The infamous Shounen Bat is terrorizing the residents of Musashino City. Flying around on his rollerblades and beating people down with a golden baseball bat, the assailant seems impossible to catch—much less understand. His first victim, the well-known yet timid character designer Tsukiko Sagi, is suspected of orchestrating the attacks. Believed only by her anthropomorphic pink stuffed animal, Maromi, Tsukiko is just one of Shounen Bat's many victims.

As Shounen Bat continues his relentless assault on the town, detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa begin to investigate the identity of the attacker. However, more and more people fall victim to the notorious golden bat, and news of the assailant begins circulating around the town. Paranoia starts to set in as chilling rumors spread amongst adults and children alike.

Will the two detectives be able to unravel the truth behind Shounen Bat, or will the paranoia get to them first?

##Why should I watch Paranoia Agent?

Paranoia Agent is the brainchild of Satoshi Kon. He is the director of acclaimed films such as Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, and Tokyo Godfathers. This is his one and only TV show he was the creator and director for. I've really been getting into his work as of late, and I really want to check out the TV show he created. And what better timing given it's the 20 year anniversary than to watch it with you guys?

I'm looking for a relatively big anime that I'll have good memories off,"In few weeks my vacation will finish and I'll start a new stage of my life, so I want to binge-watch an relatively big anime in a week or half to be some sort of my last memorable anime in a while. I want one that I will always remember in future for its quality, eccentricitie or some stuff like that. About the length of the anime, I don't have any quantity in specific, but I want something like 40+ eps but not super big so I can actually finish (at least one season) in a week or half binge-watching.
I like almost any kind of genres in anime so feel free to recommend me any! Also, I have my myanimelist in my bio if u want to see what I've already seen or something like that

To make it easier, I'll say some animes that I like and maybe has a similar quantity of eps as the one I'm wondering to find:
Fullmetal Alchemist;
Monster;
Monogatari Series;
Jojo;
Kaiji (S1 and S2);

I haven't watched so many big animes so I already considered watching some that are in my plan to watch: Sailor moon, HxH, Sakura Card Captors, Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu, Gintama, Haikyu and some others. But I can't decide one to watch and I want others ideas and suggestions too.",False,anime,1706392829.0,1acm799,What to Watch?

What's scarier zoospor? Going to school with a god, or the introvert suddenly becoming outgoing? 

- God Lain is up in the classroom cracking jokes to her classmates she was previously too shy to say a word around. God powers be giving her confidence and shit. Alice is correctly terrified by Lain, as she knows that Lain manipulated reality and changed everyone's memory. Can you even imagine sitting in the same classroom as God? Understandably scary.  

Mofish and Smiley score a jab jab punch one two combo! 

>> If she is this powerful, where exactly is there supposed to be dramatic tension for her?

>After I finish an anime series, I sometimes wonder what the experience would be like if I had watched the last few episodes first (akin to Oscar Wilde's quote about reading a novel backwards).

>You're the only poster thus far I've seen mention that the implications of this episode make the previous ones totally irrelevant in a dramatic sense.

Vaadwaur gave me the funny image in my mind of Eiri getting mad and shuuing Arisu

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      

Alfie wins our last Abyssbringer prompt! Woohoo! 

>  Lain did an instrumentality.

> It's hard for me to spin this one to my preferred ""this is all a hallucination"" explanation, but here goes: Since the last episode we've changed the lens through which we view this world from Lain to Arisu, who is also beginning to experience psychosis, which she associates with Lain putting her in a spiral of ""lose grip on reality > think about Lain > lose grip more > etc"". Lain and Arisu have strong feelings towards each other so they end up in their own world and Arisu's focus on Lain makes *everything* about Lain, especially stuff related to the Wired with which she knows Lain is obsessed.

> It's not that the psychosis is contagious, but perhaps Arisu was always so considerate of Lain because she understood the struggle. Either she but wasn't as bad, was on meds, or hadn't even realized her own condition (maybe a weird comparison, but kinda like how gay and trans kids are often drawn to each other before they even come out due to other aspects of their personalities).

Need help finding name (it’s eating away at me slowly),"I need help finding the name to a really odd anime that I remember watching as a kid on DVD.

Pls help it’s been on my brain for years eating away at my soul I need to know. 

From what I barely remember the plot was centred this group of adults(?) who did live theatre but the B plot had bombs and guns and shit. I will list what I can remember.

- For what could have been a Christmas episode (or movie special I’m still not sure if this was a show or a movie) they were at some sort of outdoors small festival/party. One of the characters, a blonde (?) woman who was very adept with guns, shoots a bullet in the air and another one after at a man dressed in a tree costume and they ricochet one of bullets embed themselves in the wall and the other does not kill the man but hits a target on him.

- Later on the same episode/movie while some of the group were watching/acting in a play the women from the previous scene is having a face off with the episodes/movies antagonist while two (more or less) friends diffuse bombs that are planted in plant pots under the plants I believe. The antagonist is a man with a suitcase. The suitcase is the controller (a device inside the suitcase he inserts his arm into) for a large mech/robot. This robot having a mini gun type gun (three barrels) for an arm. The woman and the antagonist during this fight shoot at each other at the same time and their bullets hit eachother straight on (one golden one silver bullet). She mentions having past ties to mafia in this episode.

- In a different episode (maybe or it’s all one movie it was all on the same disc) the little sister(?) of one of the members of the group runs away for some reason, eventually stumbling on a man telling a story to a group of children, he is a street performer who sells cookies, she wants one but doesn’t have the money for one because she ran away obviously but the dude gives her one anyways (in secret I think). The women from the last two scenes I listed eventually finds her.

- I also loosely remember some B villains who were used as comedy relief. They were shot by the robot in the second scene listed and appear injured in the third scene listed.

- I also remember the group going to a festival where they threw rings or horseshoes.",False,anime,1706386752.0,1acjxos,Help

Jujutsu Kaisen’s fights are the narrative/story.,"I don’t know if it’s an unpopular argument but I believe jujutsu kaisen has very good writing. I have seen people throw the argument that it’s just fighting with no substance and weak writing. 
This argument perplex me because sure on the one hand the characters in jjk are nothing special in terms of their personal goals and beliefs.  But well executed and creative fights with lots of moving parts that makes sense is a robust example of great writing. This story is about fighting. It is the substance. Whether it appeals to someone or not is based on personal taste. It does not pretend to be some deep character study but rather focusing on the intricacies of curses and the clashes caused by them. That is what Akutami Gege is writing this story for. Jujutsu Kaisen roughly translates to “Sorcery Fight”. Hopefully I was able to clear some confusion about why jujutsu kaisen seems to be hyper focused on only Fights. 
I would love to hear everyone else’s opinion on the matter.",False,anime,1706377588.0,1acgf76,Discussion
Looking for a Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro OST,"The soundtrack I'm searching for is not included in the 33 official tracks listed on the Fandom Wiki.

It plays at the end of episode 10 (the one about the singer Aya Eijia), starting around 19:55
It's a melancholy insturmental track with lots of piano and probably saxophone in the background. If anyone knows the title, that's already great help!

I don't know whether the source for the episode I found is illegal or not, so I won't post any links.

Thanks in advance for any help!",False,anime,1706375738.0,1acfpk6,Help

Animation budget was wasted on [Reborn to Master the Blade],"The story and plot are complete dogshit, steelblood plot was a bit interesting but but they decided to shove it aside as side stories, so instead of some interesting we got the same generic OP MC bs with a genderbent twist as its ""unique"" thing.

The info about the highlanders was way more interesting but we got none of that, instead all we know is that they are a bunch of assholes, who treat humans (our MC's side) like literal slaves.

One thing good about this anime its animation and art style, not an animation expert but the character movements looked smooth and nicely shaded. Better than most isekai's and otome villainesses genre animes.  Its peobably better than blue lock whose manga sales competes with the likes of JJK and CSM.

What magical girl show takes place in the most realistic (not necessarily dark) setting?,"I'm looking for a magical girl show where the location or the setting feels the most realistic and natural. Something reminiscent of our real world. So something very close to our world, and the magical girl ability and the monsters that emerge say from the evil sorceress truly feel like anomalies. 

So far, the magical girls shows I've seen (that I'm willing to count as something I properly watched) are Sailor Moon, Cutie Honey 79 and Shin, the Fate/Kaleid Series, the first 10 or so episodes of Cardcaptor Sakura, Re:Creators (kinda magical girls show), this season's gushing over magical girls, first 2 episodes of Madoka, Magical Girl Site, and Tokyo Mew Mew. 

I find it hard to explain the vibe I'm looking for. 

Cardcaptor Sakura so far is I'd say the most grounded one, but there are still scenes that imo are a bit unrealistic. One of them is quite early on, there was a infiltration of a museum, and the way it was handled got me thinking ""no, you definitely would've been caught.""

I'm not really against the magical girl transformations, it's magic after all, but I want those scenes to be treated as if they truly are special things that you won't see anywhere else in this world.

Cutie Honey (the ones I've seen at least) are very cartoony, one being a 70s show an Shin taking place in a dystopian future. Also Cutie honey is a lot different from the 'precure' type magical girl shows we get today.

Sailor Moon takes place in a realistic-ish setting, but a lot of things are simplified and exaggerated (since obvi the demographic is for little girls). 

Fate/Kaleid is another one I'd consider super grounded, but the magical girl element doesn't feel special and unique since rather than being the main point of magic in that world, it's more of a subcategory of magecraft.

Gushing over magical girls kind of has what I'm looking for. The magical girls are treated like celebrities and they somewhat give explanations as to why they aren't instantly recognized, but.... y'know-

Re:Creators work great here, they go through great lengths to keep the world as grounded as possible, but it's less about a magical girl show more than it is anime in general. The magical girl also came from an anime (reverse-isekai) rather than a girl from the 'real world' getting magical girl powers.

The last time I asked, I've heard people suggest shows like magical girl site, but I don't really think it's what I'm looking for. The setting isn't this bubbly fantasy world, but it's really just taken to the other extreme with dark horror that feels like shock value for the sake of it. I'm looking for a realistic location and character reactions, but that doesn't necessarily mean I want it to be grimdark and cruel.

Imagine if a magical girl does the pose and she cringes because she's self aware. Or maybe she faces a scary monster that actually ends up hurting people and (being a little girl) she freezes and cries at the sight. She goes home and cries to her parents if her parents are present at all. There's a lot of fantasy flashy stuff, but the characters themselves feel 'real.' This is really hard to explain because magical girl shows usually do take place in the 'real world', but the vibe feels somewhat tilted towards a direction I can't explain. 

I guess the 'take' I'm going for is something similar to what Grimgar was for Isekai. It took that concept and played it incredibly grounded with how it would actually be if people got sent into a fantasy world. 

If not that, then this season's Bravern. The world outside of Bravern is played as serious as it get get, but Bravern itself feels so out of place. Imagine a 'Bravern' being the magical girl essence in an otherwise normal 'real world.'

I know what I'm looking for beats the purpose and demographic for magical girl shows in general since it's geared towards little girls, but I am very curious if a show like that does exist.

Edit:

I'm fine with silly and comedic light hearted moments, as long as it isn't anything that feels too exaggerated and slapstick-y.

This is more of a perosnal preference, but please no sci-fi elements like Mechs. This doesn't really break the main point of realistic settings, but more so me not bring a fan of blending magical and sci-fi.

Anime about a blonde girl that can talk to and helps animals from early 2000s or 90s maybe?,"I remember quite a while ago watching an anime series about a blonde girl, who would help animals in the human world that would sometimes be peoples pets etc and then to fully help the animals problems she’d go to an animal world where there was just talking animals etc. I remember one episode there was a nerdy kid in the girls class who played games and had a pet bird, the boys name was Mario I distinctly remember that because in the dub (because I remember watching it in English) he says something along the lines of “yes like the video game character” when asked about his name. I also remember an episode about her helping a dolphin at the beach. There was also another episode where she came back from the animal world and I think she ending up in/near a bush, and then she saw her family out of nowhere? Any ideas?

Trying to find a song (maybe from Banana fish),"So this might be a bit of a stretch but does anyone remember a while ago on tiktok (I can’t remember if it was trending or i just got a lot of videos like it on my fyp), there was a trend of using images from banana fish in a slideshow and on each thing it would say something like “me when I wake up in the morning”, “me when I get home” “me when I see my dad” “me and my dad because we are the biggest haters” etc (it didn’t have to be that in specifics but it was something like that.) but in every one of those videos there was a song in the background and I can’t for the life of me remember what it was and I’ve been trying to find one of those slideshows to see if I can find the song but I can’t find any.

Most sickeningly toxic anime(s) you've seen?,"I'm talking about anime that you see as blatantly preaching and condoning some really toxic messages or values that would be frowned upon outside of the story.

I'll start:

- **Darling in the Franxx**: ""if you see a loved one obviously getting abused by a spouse who even claims to not care if her partner DIES as a result, then unless the person explicitly asks for your assistance, DON'T YOU DARE take any action to help him, even if his life is at stake, otherwise, you're just a selfish asshole who only cares about making yourself feel better. After all, if the victim doesn't open up about it, then obviously his situation is as healthy as it can get, right? What? Stockholm syndrome? Don't be stupid. There's clearly no such thing! (sorry. This section turned into a bit of a rant) 

- **Your Lie in April**: well, I think by now, it's been brought to light just how HORRIBLY toxic its handling of abuse and trauma is in regards to parental and romantic relationships.

- **Don't Toy with me miss Nagatoro**, at least that's the impression that the 1st episode gives. I'm still yet to see the rest

- **Most of Pokémon's first season**, condoning narcissistsic bullying towards those less skilled than you are, victim blaming, pokémon abuse, heck, even justifying murdering opponent's pokémon just because you can. Thank God they stopped with this vibe from season 4 downwards.

- **Rising of the shield hero S1**, though it was only the part where Naofumi was accused of somehow being made out to be at fault for the abuse and slander he's received, and just because he doesn't want to go out of his way to ""Win over"" the people who off their own judgement decided to frame, insult and harass him just for existing

And those were the examples I could think of. How about you? Please bear in mind that this topic is mostly YMMV and that you shouldn't be an asshole to others just because you don't agree.",False,anime,1706351933.0,1ac84k0,Discussion

I completed the series and I felt like I wasted my time on such an absurd show. I understand that they somehow created a pseudoclosure for Shinji's character by addressing his existential dread and creating a sense of meaning by the end. But the series is plagued by endless issues.

Mobile Suit Gundam SEED: Paving the way for a new generation,"Yup, we're here. With the 2 previous AU series not releasing to the west till the late 2010’s (ya, that freaking long), it would've been a good 10 years till we get another Alternate take of the series. But this time, it's taking more ques from the original Universal Century and creating the Cosmic Era, the most divisive Gundam Universe in the franchise. You either think it's a creative way to reintroduce the series or you hate it for existing. I'm in neither camp, as despite not being a big fan of the CE, I thought the anime itself was pretty decent. Kinda funny that this came out 2 years after I was born, and yet didn't watch it until summer of 2020 during a road trip I was on with my family after my highschool graduation. I have quite a few points I can make on this show (both positive & negative) and make some comparisons to some other anime in the meantime. So for anyone who hates reading walls of texts, you might wanna exit now. Otherwise, buckle up, cuz I got a lot to say

* Plot:
   * In the year Cosmic Era 71, a group from the colony of Heliopolis must endeavor on a journey to Earth away from ZAFT (Zodiac Alliance of Freedom Treaty). But as 4 of the 5 Earth Alliance Gundams were stolen from the enemy, Coordinator Kira Yamato must defend his friends with the Strike Gundam from his own kind and even his childhood friend Athran Zala. However, little do they know that the Earth Alliance may be more dangerous than ZAFT.
   * Did the 1st half sound familiar? While obviously not beat for beat, this anime really takes a lot of ques from the original Gundam series. A crew of lower rank soldiers and civilians running a prototype warship while a civilian is only one capable of using the Gundam, while on the run from space fascists, ain't it quite the same. Although I will dock points for reusing the plot, I can at least say that ZAFT stealing 4 of the 5 Gundams does add a lot of stakes to the series. With Kira being the only who can pilot the Gundam, it makes the fights more tense as he stands between the Archangel living or dying.
   * The plot also has themes of hatred towards “the other” affects us. We see throughout the series how hate can affect us; like how damaged the relationship between Kira & Athrun became, the Earth Alliance nuking a colony because of the threat of the Coordinators, or both EA & ZAFT doing heinous war crimes to get rid of one another. It shows how hatred blinds us and makes us do stupid things. So while the series has some holes here and there, on the whole it's just ok. Nothing too special and it's just your standard Gundam series carried by the mechanical designs and Mecha action. Though the pacing could be a little better.
* Character:
   * I think this is where most of the criticisms come from when talking about the show's divisive reputation, the cast. This is them most K-Drama/Telenovela you'll see in a Gundam series.
   * Let's just talk about the one person you MC hating otakus hate the most, Kira Yamato. It's no secret that he's on a lot of people's shit list of “bad anime protagonists”, but I think the hate is overblown out of proportion. While one my 1st watch, I thought I might hate the guy, but I was just indifferent and thought he was pretty decent. He just starts off as your typical computer nerd who hangs out with his friends. But is pushed into battle after seeing the destruction of his home. I honestly think the problem is that we don't even go that deep into his character, especially certain parts in the last half.
      * But I'll start with stuff I like, I just like that he's just a selfless guy. There's a lot of things he doesn't want to do, but does anyway because he cares about his friends that much. I also like that he frees Lacus without a second thought just because it was the right thing to do. I also like that there are times where he does regret killing some pilots. He also has a great rivalry with his older best friend, but I'll get to that eventually.
      * As for stuff I don't really like about, while not bugging the shit out of me, it is still understandable why he's not viewed in the best light. For starters he acts like a total dick to his friend when he finds out that he had an affair with Flay, and instead of recognizing what was wrong, he just brushes it off and never brings it up again. Also the reveal that he's the “Ultimate Coordinator” feels half baked and doesn't even go anywhere. But let's address the Gundanium elephant in the room, his Luna titanium plot armor people love to bitch about. But I'll save that for an eventual Destiny review. Another problem is that the anime is that it speed-run through his development. Went from fighting out of desperation to non-lethally destroying mobile suits. I'm just gonna say watch Unicorn to see how this development is done better. Banagher is just better than written Kira. Hell, Kirito from Sword Art Online is a better written version of Kira.
   * Now let's get to the opposite side of the spectrum, Athrun Zala. He's honestly a pretty good character in his own right, as he actually has a character arc. He starts off as someone who fully believes in ZAFT and what they're doing is completely justified after what the Earth Alliance has done. But he eventually learns that ZAFT aren't that much better after meeting Cagali and joins her & everyone else to stop both the Alliance & ZAFT. It's a great character arc for someone on the other side. I also like that he has a hard time fighting his best friend and tries his best to convince him to join him, which makes his rivalry with him more interesting. But like Kira, there's a few things I'm not a fan of. The big one is like another ZAFT pilot, he isn't really called out for brutally murdering a pilot in an aircraft by any of the members of the Archangel and is barely confronted by the consequences of his actions. I also find it insane that he's more flexible & fast than either the pilots or just the typical ground soldiers. I'm not sure if the others went through the same training or part of those coordinator genes, but damn, that white boy can move.
   * As for the love interests, they were okay. Lacus Clyne and Cagalli Yula Athha are alright. Lacus is your typical gullible princess who thinks everyone should get along, but doesn't understand it's not that simple. But then just steals weapons of mass destruction. I… I'm not gonna question it, she does her. But in all seriousness, she has a similar problem as Kira, that this would've worked if it was actually developed but it just isn't. Again, watch Unicorn since Audrey is a better version of this.
   * Cagalli has a little more depth to her as she does have a pretty interesting character arc. She wants to get involved in the war since her home country remains neutral and is rightfully upset when she learns her country is working for the Earth Alliance to develop mobile suits. She has a good character arc. However, when she learns that Kira was her twin brother, nothing really changes either. The anime treat it like a massive reveal, but their relationship doesn't really change all that much.
   * And there's the relationships between the 4, okay… there's a lot, and I mean ALOT to unpack. Let's start with the big one, Kira & Lacus. I think they're a fine couple since they share the same beliefs. They believe that the best way to stop the fighting is through non lethal means. It's definitely better than his relationship with a certain bitch I'll get to later. But honestly Athrun x Cagalli are the better couple, as they have way more depth to them. They both agree that the Earth Alliance must be stopped, but they challenge each other's viewpoints. Athrun has her think about how her people's neutrality might not work in the long run. As Cagalli makes him consider that, despite their pretty justified intentions, ZAFT might be just as bad as the Alliance. It's a good dynamic, and shows how much they deserve each other.
   * I've already mentioned Kira and Cagalli’s relationship, so I'll cut to Athrun and Lacus. Despite people memeing on it, I felt that these 2 didn't really belong with each other. Although they do care about one another, their beliefs are too different. While they do believe in both ZAFT & the Coordinators, Lacus believes that both Coordinators & Naturals could get along while Athrun (at least in the beginning) strictly believes that all Naturals are the cause of the war. So all adultery jokes aside, Lacus x Athrun wouldn't really work, since its an arranged marriage set up by their parents.
   * So as we move onto the other characters of the 3 factions, you'll notice the paragraphs I made explaining the main 4. If the numerous marketing placed on these 4 haven't made it obvious, it goes to show that they had more focus in the whole series compared to the other characters. However, there were still some good apples on both sides. So let's start with the ones on the Earth Alliance.
   * Starting with the main three; Murrue Ramius, Mu La Flaga, & Natarle Badgiruel. These 3 were easily the best of the whole Archangel crew.
      * Murrue follows a similar role as Bright from the original Gundam series, where she's an underranked soldier who's forced to take on a commanding role and lead under trained soldiers as well as civilians to safety. You can see her growing into the role with the amount of the struggles that came with the territory.
      * Next there's Mu La Flaga, need I say more. He's your typical hotshot pilot and all the better for it. And he can put his money where his mouth is, as like another badass pilot without plot armor (in this anime at least), he can go toe to toe with a whole ass mobile suit with a spaceship and a jet. Now that's how to assert dominance. However, he might need to work on his wording as he can easily piss off some people without meaning too. As for his relationship with Murrue, it's easily the best. Not too different from Hal x Carol from DC. A hotshot pilot & his sexy boss who swore off dating other pilots until they got close together. And as they grow close together, one of them makes the ultimate sacrifice to protect the one they love. That last part may be done to death nowadays, but I think it works better here since we genuinely spent time with these 2.
      * And then there's Natarle Badgiruel who's a really underrated character if we're being honest. She serves perfectly as a foil to Murrue as her tactics are pretty brutal and highlights how fucked up the Earth Alliance can believe. Hell, she straight up suggested to use Kira's parents as hostages to force to him into piloting the damn Gundam. She perfectly reflects how Murrue might have turned out if she didn't stick to her morals.
   * But as go down the EA list, we realize that we're starting to hit the bottom of the barrel. I'll start with Kira's buddies; Sai Argyle,Miriallia Haw, and Tolle Koenig. Sai Argyle is basically Futoshi but NTD’d harder and Tolle is Miriallia’s BF till he gets shielded in the face. Ya… Miriallia is the only one with anything to do. And its highlighted in that scene in the sick bay. She almost killed a ZAFT soldier in the hospital out of revenge for Tolle and nearly ended up like the majority of the Earth Alliance we see. That YT I've mentioned in the beginning already covered how much of a good scene that was. It's just a damn shame she doesn't do anything else for the whole series.
   * And now we're scraping at the bottom of the barrel, the bigots of Electronic Arts. Let's start off with proto Myne, Flay Alster. I hate this bitch. She's easily the most hated girl of seed and for good reason. For starters, she's a fucking xenophobic who hates coordinators, to the point where she threatened Lacus. She also guilt trips Kira with a child. Oh, I'm not done yet. Did I mention that she cheated on her fiance for Kira just to manipulate him? The lion, the witch, and the audacity of this bitch. I deadass felt nothing but joy when she got brutally murdered.
   * On to Blue Cosmos, Muruta Azrau is just a rich racist prick who tortures 3 kids (Shani, Orga, & Clotho) into fighting. He definitely got what he deserves. and the rest of the Alliance are the same
   * I'll just cut to ZAFT. Mainly the Ra Le Creuset team. 1st of all, let's discuss the masked menace himself, Ra Le Creuset. The man is just delightfully cunning as he has a good read on people. I also do like how he progressively goes insane over time. And then totally freaks the fuck out the moment his true face is revealed. Towards the end, they don't even hide how much he wants to kill everybody. It's so hilariously insane that I can't take him seriously. As for tradition for every Char Clone, he's gotta have a sexy voice. And thankful Mark Oliver delivered as he went hard AF. Rent was due, and this lad was paid.
   * As for his war mongering members of marry men, I can't really say many positive things about them. Outside Athrun who I've already gone into deep detail with, barely any of the Rau team are likable. The only attempt they had was with Dearka Elsman. He's basically a chill guy with an actual character arc. When he got captured by the Archangel, it highlights how heated the rivalry between the Naturals & Coordinators are. He makes fun of the Naturals until meeting them and nearly gets killed by them. It's a wake up call for him and shows him that Coordinators aren't that different from Naturals in both positive & negative ways.
   * Yzak Joule & Nicole Amalfi are easily the worst. Yzak is just a straight up asshole and the anime doesn't even try to hide it. They tried making into a loveable jerk, but completely forget about the loveable parts. Once he shot that transport with INNOCENT CIVILIANS, that was when I grew a deep hatred for him. What's worst it's that he never learns that the craft he shot had civilians. As for Nicole, I also don't like him, though not as much and for different reasons. The only personality trait is that he likes playing the piano. Other than that, he's more invisible than his own Gundam. People mourned Nicole’s death, but I ain't one of those people because not only he had nothing I can latch onto personality wise, his death is more on him because he changed head on towards without a second thought. People blame Kira, but honestly I would've done the same thing as a flight or fight response.
   * I'm not going waste time with the other characters from either ZAFT or Orb. All you need to know is; Patrick Zala has a superiority complex because his wifey died, Uzumi Nara Athha blows himself up, the Astray sisters (Asagi, Juri, & Mayura) are basically the Shrike team, Ledonir is Cagalli's dark skinned butler (interpret that as you will), and Andrew Waltfeld is Rambal Ral if he survived & had plot armor.
   * Here's the TL;DR, the characters are very, VERY divisive. One minute you can tolerate them or in the evening think they're cool characters, the next you think they're annoying or are the worst person known to man. Who you love and/or hate is up to you, but I've said my piece (writing about the characters are always the hardest part of these reviews).
* World building:
   * Since this is a new take on the Universal Century under the name “Cosmic Era”, surely they would have a unique form of world building….. right? Well….sure…. but not by a lot. There's there's things about this world that are pretty unique to this universe, with other things that are basically meaningless in the grand scheme of things.
   * For starters, why do space colonies look like hourglasses? Like, how does anyone live in thes? Also do you know that NewTypes exist in this universe along with fucking SPACE WHALES? Does this add anything significant to the SEED lore?.....Nope, it's so meaningless that you can take these out and it wouldn't make a difference.
   * But in the case of the Coordinators, I can at least say they the Cosmic Era a little interesting ... for the most part. They don't have the mystique or sense of wonder of the NewTypes from the original Gundam series, but they still have their quirks. Ever seen the movie Gattaca, well it's basically that but with anime hairstyles. The concept of babies genetically modified before birth is an interesting concept and it adds a lot of commentary about the ethics of genetic modification. There's an episode that shows us how the Coordinators came to be and how violently Naturals (normal human beings) reacted. It led to various hate riots, protests against each other, and the infamous Junius seven bombing that led to the Bloody Valentine Wars. Although not 1 to 1, it kinda reflects what happened in our world for many years with various races. People always fear things they don't understand. It was pretty brutal, and it luckily didn't end with one side dropping power blocking drills.
   * Speaking of which, the N-Jammers are kinda overkill. They basically block all forms of nuclear energy making nukes and power plants useless. Basically anti-Hiroshima the whole earth. It's one thing to make nukes useless, it's another to make towns that rely on nuclear energy to power their homes. They do introduce N-Jammer Cancellers, that nullify said Jammers, a jammer that jam jammer that jams nuclear energy. But instead of using them to fix their energy crisis, they're used for Gundams and nukes.
   * Which leads to my next point, both the Earth Alliance and ZAFT are the most evil factions in all of Gundam, I'm only half joking. These 2 sides does so much fucked up shit that it's really hard to root for any of them. The Earth Alliance bombs space colonies, uses children as experiments, and is funded by a hate group called Blue Cosmos. As for ZAFT, they caused various nuclear power outages, attacked colonies, and ravaged towns that don't even support the Earth Alliance. Did mention that they a fucking space laser on each side. Seeing the Cyclops system and GENESIS (Gamma Emission by Nuclear Explosion Stimulate Inducing System) popping people into a bloody mess like balloons is something that's always messed up to see. One side runned by xenophobic space bigots, while the other are runned by genetically modified assholes with a superiority complex that can't even reproduce. You have to be fucked up to join any of these sides.
   * The only side that you actually want to root for in this anime is Orb. The Orb Union are the ones who don't have the urge to commit war crimes since they stay neutral throughout the whole series until the last few episodes after Uzumi blew himself up along with Orb, where Cagalli joins up with the 3 ships alliance. So these factions follow the same problem as Zeta and AWGX, the 2 opposing forces are so fucked in the head with their evil beliefs that you obviously want to root for the less evil ones. I know Gundam's well known for ambiguous “no side is fully good or evil”, but EA, ZAFT, and Orb are so obviously one part of the spectrum that it removes the ambiguity of the morals of these guys.
   * One last thing I've found interesting is how eerily similar this is with Code Geass. Hell, Code Geass is more of a copy of Seed than it is with any other Gundam series. Let's run them down;
      * A war started because of racism
      * One side having the upper hand because of having giant robots 1st
      * said Mecha always getting hijacked
      * 2 childhood friends turned rivals because of differing ideals
      * one of them have inhuman like reflexes
      * a gulibe pink haired princess who may or may not die
      * supernatural abilities involving eyes
      * a tsundere turned Mecha pilot
      * the tsundere being trapped on an island with the enemy
      * a horny racist thot
      * a figure in power that just so happens to be the MC’s dad who's also a dick
      * even the same character designer
   * The people working on Code Geass were clearly taking inspirations from SEED. I find it weird that people often compare it to Sword Art Online and not Code Geass since the comparisons are right there (and this is coming from someone who saw and liked all three). Either way, they're honestly not a whole lot for the Cosmic Era. It's basically just a reimagining of the Universe Century, but with not much of the charm of said universe. It's kinda hard to see why Japan has a hard on for this universe right next to the Universal Century.
* Mobile Suits:
   * Now it's time for the best part about these reviews (if you guys read em), the mobile suits. Starting off with the Gundams, let me tell you, Bandai pulled out all the stops with these Gundam designs. There's a total of 11 Gundams, ELEVEN, DOUBLE DIGITS. And I'm not even counting variants, MSVs, or other mobile suits. No joke, we haven't gotten THIS MANY Gundams since G Gundam. We have under a dozen mobile suits to cover, so let's get to it.
   * However, 3 things bug me about the mobile suits.
   * 1.) The beam effects always feel weak with those spammy green beam colors. They should've stuck with the usual pink & yellow designs when it came to the beam colors. The red beam designs look good though
   * 2.) While I do like the idea of the Phase Shift armor being made for anti-ballistic defense, I don't like that it changes the color of the mobile suit. Mecha that changes colors is one of my many Mecha pet peeves as it feels unnecessary and it could've just been painted its iconic colors
   * And 3.) despite being the GTA of Gundam, it's weird that it's only Gundams and the ones doing the hijackings are the coordinators. Apparently they're the only ones that can use mobile suits. I'm also not a fan of this idea because I'm so used to mobile suits in general being able to be used by anyone. And it sucks that the rules change depending on the series. Sometimes you can be an average Joe and use a mobile suit, sometimes you can't. Sometimes you have to be a NewType and sometimes you gotta get surgery to use one. And I hate how some of the characters get all cheeky and go “um obviously you can't hijack mobile suits. Duh, this is real life. And in real life, we fight giant robots with tanks and bazookas”. Like it's all bullshit anyways. The military don't use bipedal machines yet, so just play it straight. I typically prefer shows where anything works. In the original Universal Century, you can hijack a mobile suit in a million different ways, making the stories more interesting. The Turn A can be used by anyone, making it more deadly. And yet people get scared shitless when a MS shows up with I shit you not, a machine gun and a small ass sword. You shouldn't be acting big with a loadout like that. With that being said, I still think these designs are pretty good. Starting with the basic boy itself, the Strike Gundam.
      * Although I'm not a big fan of the french fries attena, the base design is pretty good. By itself it's a by the numbers machine with nothing more than a pair of Igelstellung CIWS guns (good luck pronouncing that) and a pair of Armor Schneider combat knives. But once it gets the Striker Packs, that's when things get interesting.
      * The Aile Striker Pack gives it a beam rifle, 2x beam sabers, a shield, and a backpack that grants it high mobility in both the atmosphere and in space.
      * The Sword Striker Pack has the Schwert Gewehr Anti-Ship sword that makes the Dragon Slayer look like a toothpick, the Panzer Eiser rocket anchor for some grappling hook action, and the Midas Messer Beam Boomerang for some Crikey action mate (insert Australian joke here), good for getting up and personal.
      * The Launcher Striker Pack has the Agni Beam Cannon and Combo weapons pod (a mini gun & 2 cannons), just hang back & shoot.
      * And finally there's the Multiple Assault Striker Pack that takes all 3 packs and turn the Strike into the Perfect Strike. Basically the good ol’ all-in-one Gundam to get the job done.
      * There's also Strike Rouge that's just a pink Strike that supports the Pink Ribbons. It can use a bazooka BTW. This is just one Gundam and we're just getting started.
   * Next we got the 4 stolen Gundams.
      * Starting off with the Duel Gundam, an all round machine made for any situation with your standard load out (vulcans, shields, a pair of beam sabers, and a beam rifle with a grenade launcher). But things get interesting once it gets the Assault Shroud, which not only gives it extra armor, but also the cannon/missile combo that's found in a lot of Mecha (especially Gundam).
      * Next we got the Buster Gundam made exclusively for medium to long range attacks. With its missile pods, A Gun launcher with ballistic weapons, and long beam rifle for any situation from a distance. And if he needs some extra firepower, combine the 2 and use a super sniper or super shotgun for some more dakka. However, its only downside is that it doesn't have any melee weapons to defend itself from up close attacks. Though since its main role is long range support, I'll give it a pass.
      * Next we got the Blitz Gundam, a stealthy suit given to the wrong pilot. With a Trikeros shield with some wonderful toys (a beam rifle, a beam saber, & darts) and the Piercer Lock “Gleipner” for some grabby grabby action from a distance. It can turn invisible with the Mirage Collide, giving it an advantage in stealth (hence why I'm more mad that it was given to a stupid ass pianist who got his dumbass shish kabobed by a fucking sword with a beam edge. Why didn't he turn invisible to stop the Strike? Is he stupid?).
      * And finally we have Aegis Gundam, and it's a transformable Gundam that um…..who wants Takoyaki. In MS mode, it has the usual vulcans, 4x beam sabers with one saber on each limb, and a beam rifle. You know, the usual stuff any mobile suit can have. And there's the Mobile Armor mode, and sweet Christ what was the designer on when it came to the transformation. God damn, is this thing a squid girl cuz that beam kuchi can squirt (I mean it is called the Scylla so……). All I can say is that Athrun can bring out the most out of the damn thing.
   * Before I move onto the other Gundams and eventually the mobile suits, let's talk about the team’s dynamic of the Rau Creuset team. Compared to the previous Gundam team, I say it's a massive improvement in terms of roles. The Aegis & Blitz are great for close combat, the Buster is good for long range support, and the duel is a good mix of close & long range combat with its equipment. My only complaint is the pilots. Outside of Athrun and Dearka, use their machines pretty effectively, Yzak & Nicole just don't really fit these suits. Especially with the former acting like a total count the whole time. Nicole used the Blitz fine at first to sneak into a base, and then after that he just forgets that he can turn invisible 90% of the time.
   * Next up are the 3 Gundams used by EA’s pet Coordinators.
      * The Calamity is a Gundam that's a bitch cuz bitches love cannons. Aside from the aforementioned cannons, it has a chest cannon, a shield with 2x beam cannons, and a bazooka. So basically an artillery MS.
      * Next is the Aqua boy, the Forbidden Gundam. CIWS guns, machine guns, 2 rail guns, a beam cannon, and a scythe, this loadout makes this thing the terror of the deep end.
      * Finally, there's the Raider Gundam with a MA mode. For starters it has a dual beam rifle onits shield, the Zorn beam cannon on its mouth, and the Mjornar mace for bonking action. As for its MA mode, while a little weird, still looks better than that mechanical squid monstrosity. And it has a better loadout too; 2x shoulder machine guns, a nose machine gun, and a short range plasma cannon that can also act as a short beam blade. Funny looking, but effective.
   * I won't say much about the team dynamic since these machines came in last minute and we didn't have the time to flesh out the dynamic since they're too busy doing their jobs.
   * On to the final 3 Gundams, made by ZAFT but 2 of 3 of them got stolen by Lacus.
      * Starting off with the main boy himself, the Freedom Gundam. This thing ain't iconic for no reason by aesthetics alone, as it has an angelic figure to inspire a sense of hope towards it's allies. It's definitely in the wings, which aren't just for show you know. It has the High-Mobility Aerial Tactics mode (Hi-MAT for short), which grants the thing great maneuverability in the air and in space. As for its load out, it has the goodies. It has the usual stuff like a beam rifle, 2x beam sabers, 2x Picus CIWS guns, and an anti-beam shield while also having 2x Plasma shoulder cannons and 2x hip rail guns (we need more mobile suits with hip range weapons). It also has the Multi Lock-on system, which is an aim-bot that locks onto multiple targets at once. There's also the Full-Burst mode that shoots all the listed weapons all at once. This thing is an Angel with a Shotgun (just replace shotgun with a beam rifle).
      * Moving onto the Justice Gundam, and this is easily my favorite Gundam in the show. The horn sensor may look silly AF, but I'll take it over the fucking squid. As for its weapons, this this is also packed. There's the usual; Sagittus CIWS guns, a beam rifle, a shield, and 2 beam sabers that have double beam blades. As for its extra weapons, it has Australian fever with its 2x beam boomerangs and its backpack known as the Fatum-00 (no relation to the 00) that serves as a standing glider with some extra goodies as well. We got some machine guns, turrets, and 2x beam cannons. This Gundam also has the Multi Lock-on system.
   * Before I move onto the last Gundam, let's talk about the dynamic of the former two. These 2 were made to fight together as a duel, and it's done really well. The Freedom was made for long range to support the Justice while said unit was made for close combat. These 2 units really complement each other really well. Thau is mainly because Kira & Athrun are already pretty close to one another in spite of their disagreeing stances in the anime.
      * And finally, there's the Providence Gundam, the final boss. This thing was made to be evil, and it has the stuff to back up its dastardly look outside of some simple Vulcans; a chunky beam rifle, a left arm with a beam shield, beam saber, & 2x beam guns, and how can I forget this show’s answer to bits. With a total of 11 Dragoons (3x big & 8x small), this thing can beam spam for days.
   * Now let's move onto the Other mobile suits before I lose you guys’ attention span. Starting off with the 1st ones with war MS, ZAFT.
      * We got the Ginn, a by the numbers unit with a mohawk. It has the usual goodies; a machine gun and a ballistic sword. Sometimes it has some rockets.
      * There's the Long Range Reconnaissance type, with a radome & a sniper rifle.
      * The WASP type for some fun Unda da seas, with missiles and beam cannons to fight alongside the ugly ass aquatic MSs, the G00hN & Zn0.
      * And then there's the Tactical Air Reconnaissance Type with its close beam rifle and machine. It also has the Mirage Collide System that's hopefully used better than how Nicole used it.
      * That last one paved the way for another mobile suit ZAFT made, the Dinn. It's the same, but with a Shotgun this time, no Mirage Collide, and sexier wings.
      * Next up, our mechanical doggos, the BuCUE & LaGOWE. The BuCUE has a beam saber in it's mouth instead of a stick and can use either a pair of cannons or missiles. Not a lot, but enough for our K-9 of death. The LaGOWE is similar to the BuCUE but with claws and the twin beam cannon. It's also Buffalo sauce orange for Mr. Waltfeld.
      * The CGUE is a high mobility version of the Ginn with the same stuff.
      * The GuAIZ has hip anchors and Claws bub. And finally the GuAIZ has the goodies of both the Freedom and Justice.
   * If you thought Zeon had a lot of mobile suits, ZAFT went like “hold my beer”.
   * As for the Earth Alliance, they only have like one mobile suit, the Strike Dagger. A mass production version of the Strike Gundam. Being a toned down version of the Strike, all it has are vulcans, a shield, a yellow beam saber, and a beam rifle w/ a grenade launcher. Unfortunately it can't equip Striker Packs. There’s another one that could, along with other variants based on the other 4 Gundams. But since they’re MSV and didn’t appear in the anime, I won’t count them. A+ for effort though.
   * Moving onto Orb, all they have is the M1 Astray. And before you ask, no it's not the Astray Red Frame as those are vastly different units. As for this one, all it has are a pair of vulcans, a shield, 2x beam sabers, and a beam rifle. Another good unit that can keep up with the Ginn and even the GuAIZ & CGUE to some extent. A shame they got the Gun-EZ treatment (if you know, you know).
   * When I said Bandai was Cooking in this series with the mobile suits, I wasn't joking. Hell, these are the most popular HG kits right next to the UC kits. Bland beam effects aside & reused animation aside, the fight scenes are also pretty good too. So basically, if you don't like the writing, the Mecha fights can serve as monkey brain entertaining.
* Verdict:
   * It's honestly tough to say whether or not this anime is a good entry in the franchise. On one hand it has good commentary on hate groups (Xenophobia, Racism, and even Homophobia depending on how you look at it), decent character drama, voice acting that ain't half bad, top tier mechanical designs, and interesting action scenes. On the other hand, the story is a little hard to keep up with, some characters being hard to handle, and needless plot armor, this anime has its fair share of problems. And if it weren't for the commentary on prejudice it would be a pretty by the numbers Gundam anime.
   * Looking at it now I can only imagine the impact it had on western fans. Keep in mind, both After War Gundam X & Turn A didn't get the same treatment, so Western Gundam fans must've waited nearly a decade for more AU stuff from the franchise. And despite it looking like something off of 4Kids, back in the day, it must've been insane to see this anime getting digitally animated.
   * If you're not nitpicky and want some good Mecha action, look no further than this. But if you complain about every little detail in any anime (I know who you are), I'll say look somewhere else.

An anime where a character snaps,"Today, while engrossed in an episode of MHA, witnessing Midoriya channel his anger for a triumphant victory, I couldn't help but feel a bit fatigued by the common trope of the 'angry protagonist prevails.' You know the drill: typical action shonen scenario where the hero taps into rage to protect his friends and save the day. Well, I wanna try something different.

Basicallly the title, I want suggestions of an anime where a character (not necessarly the mc) just snaps, and when I say snap, I mean they really lose it, crossing a line that contradicts their morals and principles. (I don't mind if it's gore or dark, aamof I would love if that was the case)

Looking for Mecha Anime Suggestions,"So I know I will probably get flamed for this. But im looking for some good mecha anime, that isnt like 100 years old. I know Gundam, Votoms ect. are amazing ect. But Im just not a fan of old cartoon graphics. Just really not my bag. So looking for some Good anime that have some amazing fight scenes and arent just endless drama. Tired of finding a Mecha anime and its 20 episodes of the mc just crying, bitching, and moaning. Just being all emo about shit. I just want good solid action man. Feels like the last good mecha I actually watched was Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans. Hated the ending, but man watching all the fights and seeing  Barbatos  getting upgraded and becoming just a monster. Was just amazing. 

So yea not trying to bag on older/drama based ones. Just looking for some good new fresh action mechas. Thanks",False,anime,1706318529.0,1abyqxf,Help
Sometimes it’s fascinating how certain titles will be kept in Japanese,"I mean I don’t know why I had to bring it up, but I guess it’s because lately I was looking back at how titles like Mushoku Tensei are still kept in their Japanese title as I guess my point is that I want to understand the way that translations work when it comes to bringing Anime over to English.




Like why sometimes titles like again Mushoku Tensei or say YuYu Hakusho have their titles kept in Japanese whenever they’re brought over to the USA as lately I didn’t understand why distributors will do that kind of practice instead of say translating the whole title.",False,anime,1706318410.0,1abypf2,Discussion

Anime/manga like JJK that isn't Demon Slayer or Chainsaw Man?,"I just caught up to the JJK manga, and I really enjoyed it. I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much back when the first season came out. I really hated Gojo because he felt like such a Mary Sue, but I recently decided to get back into it, and the second season (+ the manga) definitely made Gojo a lot more tolerable to me. The only issue is that now I really want something similar, but most of the anime people I know (which admittedly isn't a ton - most of my friends don't even know I watch anime) have only been able to recommend either demon slayer or CSM. 

Before I proceed, I want to highlight that I, in no way, shape or form, mean to insult either of these series. They're well liked for a reason, and I acknowledge that objectively speaking, they're good. They're just not what I'm looking for at this time.
 
I've seen quite a bit of both - read further into the CSM manga, and I didn't really enjoy them. Something about Demon Slayer just seemed a tad too childish for me, and I found the protagonist boring. I'm also really big on characterization and character interaction, and I don't feel like I got nearly enough of that with Demon Slayer. CSM was a bit more enjoyable for me, but the crude dark humor and reliance on gore just came across as overly edgy to me. 

With that in mind, are there any other series you could recommend? I don't know if this helps, but other animes I enjoyed were Fullmetal Alchemist, Samurai Champloo, and Cowboy Bebop. I know character interaction wasn't that big an element in cowboy bebop, but I still loved it nonetheless.

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
RadSuit thought my Abyssbringer prompts would *ever* be faked~
>I honestly thought the screenshot of the day for this episode was a shitpost Photoshop.  *Wow.*



Sky postex exactly the sort of post you don't want to see right before your finale 
> **Serial Experiments First-Timer, subbed**

- [](#lost)


Weedwacker hasn't seen enough inflation art to never tempt the feeder fanbase. 
>> I mentioned this in a comment in one of the other discussion posts but I really don't think there's a single scene in the show where we see Lain *actually* consuming food.  Maybe there's a scene of her drinking water.  Even in the dinner scenes with her family she's just stirring her soup not eating.

Does this hint at anything about what kind of existence she has intentionally and reinforce Eiri's insistence that Lain's physical existence is merely a hologram?  Or is this just a coincidence/accident that they never showed her eating and i'm reading into this too much?


Silcaria noticed that they kinda ran out of content towards the end. 
>  *Alright guys. We're 10 mimutes short on what we're suppose to deliver to the network so let's fill one of the episodes with a recap but let's not make it too obvious.* The recap.

zoospor got some affirmations from our software≠consciousness chats! 
>honestly it feels really good to read another comment that mentions the parallel the show makes between software and human consciousness. i've never seen anyone else put it into words before and i believe that's the core of the entire show! i noticed the cord reaching across alice's room also, definitely funny but i love that attention to detail -- the thing can't run on batteries! and i would definitely be triggered if there was no cord. helps to remind that everything is connected!

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this scene corner!!"" 


Xtsim wins yet again with a dapper Abyssbringer prompt!

> Abyss: After all that she's been through on the wired, Lain just does what she feels like, cause it does not matter anymore. She can be in a dragon form, isekai hero form, or alien. Like online, we can create our own furry avatars on a zoom meeting for work, Lain's alien form is like an avatar and it is so normal now, from profile pics to workplace zoom meetings. I do not see anything wrong with this.

##Abyssbringer's ""What is the thematic purpose of this episode corner!""      

Alfie had one of the better explanations for Lain having an affinity with aliens. 

>  # 🏱︎☼︎⚐︎💣︎🏱︎❄︎

> The alien represents otherness. Lain isn't from this world. She no longer feels as though she belongs among ""normal"" people. Nearly the same thing as Umika in Stardust Telepath. Simultaneously, Lain is developing a stronger connection to the Wired which is functionally a different world

If I think Seirei no Moribito is the best thing ever made what else should I watch?,"I haven't watched anime in over a decade but recently decided to watch avatar and legend of korra and that left me wanting more, I don't care to watch cartoons so I turned to anime and after some research I was recommended kingdom, demon slayer and seirei no moribito (guardian of the spirit)

Since I read kingdom early on is kinda ass I went with demon slayer but watched the first scene in the snow and decided the art style wasn't for me and the main little dude gave me naruto screaming for the sake of screaming vibes, and that's not what I'm looking for

I don't have any specific genre I'm looking for because my knowledge of anime is 0. I've only watched naruto, some bleach, some dragon ball and death note. Recently I also watched One punch man and vinland saga

Since apparently no one liked Moribito because all I see is like 5 threads online and 3 reviews on youtube, and people saying the anime is slow paced (????) I can only asssume I'm a superior specimen with refined taste

But really, I'm looking for something with decent realistic art style (no anime titties or hentai voices, or characters that look cartoonish to compensate for lack of personality), world building and character development (by this I don't mean something like Canute being a big clueless pussy his entire life and suddenly hears one speech and unlocks omega brain, I like vinland saga but some things feels very childish in the way they are portraid)

So yeah, if you read my whole post you might think I'm dumb or an ass hole, which you're probably right, but help me out still. If nothing comes up I'll probably research more Nahoko Uheashi's work or try to find more stuff made by Moribito's studio

And if you haven't yet, watch the anime and ask everyone you know to buy the books so I don't have to learn japanese just to read all volumes, thanks",False,anime,1706296428.0,1abqa7z,What to Watch?

My short review of Cardcaptor Sakura.,"# Overview

This is something I've wanted to do for awhile now after I watched Cardcaptor Sakura, and my god let me just say I absoultely loved this series, and it's sequel clear card.

# Premise

For those who may not know the series is about a 10 year old girl named Sakura Kimamoto who one day opens a book in her father's basement that releases these magical artificts called Clow Cards, and awakens a small little beast named Kero who makes Sakura into a ""Cardcaptor"" to collet all of the Clow Cards and bring them back to the book.

# Characters

I really love the characters of this series, even ones who seem bad at first can grow on you.

Let's start with Sakura herself. What I like about her is that she acts her age. Desptie being burden with this heavy responsiblty you are constantly reminded that she is still a child, and she gets scared, and confused by the situations she's put in. In the beginning she doesn't want to be a Cardcaptor, but as the series progresses she does learn to overcome her fears, and doubts. I also love her relationship with her brother because it feels like they are actually siblings where it's clear that they annoy each other, but also love each other greatly.

Next we have Tomoyo who is the only one of Sakura's friends to know about her secret. While it may seem over the top when she tries to get Sakura to where her dresses, but she's really supportive, and a wonderful friend.

Sharonn Li came off as a jerk at first, but as the series progressed he became a nicer, a really good friend to Sakura. It was also cute when he got jealous of other boys paying attention to Sakura.

The same can be said for Mei Ling who again started off as mean, but is now one of Sakura's best friends. I espesaiclly love her in Clear Card where she gives Sakura advice

I think all the other characters are wonderful two espiescially Sakura's other friends from school.

# Animation

I think the animaton is great. It was a 90s anime so it looks old timey, but still it's very good.

# Overall

Overall I'm really glad I watched this series, and I can't wait for more of Clear Card to come out hopefully sometime this year.

What’s an anime you have a love-hate relationship with?,"There’s been heaps of questions about what’s “objectively the best/peak” or “what’s overrated/mid/bad”, so I thought it’d be nice to strike a balance between the two, having an anime which has aspects that you like and aspects you dislike at the same time (or love and hate)

For me, a big one would be JJK. It’s dope as fk, the anime fights are awesome, but sometimes it makes me wanna pull my hair out. I’m sure manga readers would agree with me lol",False,anime,1706263731.0,1abf1lt,Discussion

Real World Novels That Appear In Anime,"Salutations All!  

Have you ever been watching an Anime, and notice a character reading a book? Then, the camera zooms in to the book cover so we as the audience can read the actual title of said book?  

The most recent anime I can think of where this happened is Gundam: Witch From Mercury in which Elan was reading A World of Will and Representation by Arthur Schopenhauer. This was shown fairly early, and if you looked the book up, it gave a pretty good hint about Elan's character. I will refrain from going much more into detail to avoid spoilers.

Why I hate Adonis from The Kingdoms of Ruin but like Eren Yeager from Attack on Titan," If there's a recent anime Character that I can say I dislike it's Adonis from The Kingdoms of Ruin a young man who sets out to kill all of humanity after the death of his witch mentor Chole. This is simlar to Eren's goal of wipping out all of humanity as well. Yet dare I say I still like Eren very much though.

Now this may come off as crazy, and some of you are wondering How I can like Eren, but hate Adonis. Espescially when you consider Eren has done much worse then Adonis. Well it has to do with their personalites.

Eren was wracked with killed and remorse over what he was doing, so much so that he kept his eyes closed during the entire Rumbling, and don't forget about his apology to a little boy he saves only to kill later.

Another reason I prefer Eren is his reason for doing The Rumbling. Eren sat and listend as the entire world went into agreement that Paradis Island had to be destroyed, and everyone on the Island need to die. Eren did all of it to protect his people, his family so that they could have a future.

Adonis on the other hand is a jerk to everyone, and doesn't care who anyone is, even to Dorako the girl who tries to make him see that revenge is wrong, but everytime she speaks he basically just tells her to shut up.

Second his reason is just out of petiness and hurt. Sure Adonis has ever right to kill the king of Redia, and possibly some Knights. But wanting to wipe out all of Humainty who had nothing to do with Chole's death is pure selfishness.

Oh also if you think about Chole's death is basically Adonis fault in the first place, because he tried to do some dumb shit, and got himself captured only for Chole to try and save him then get captured herself. So really Adonis only has himself to blame for Chole's death.

Also it's safe to say he doesn't even care about Chole and just wants to kill people, because he acknowledges that Chole wouldn't want him to seek revenge, but he still does it anyways

PSA: What you need to know to watch Meiji Gekken 1874,"A newly streaming show on Crunchyroll called Meiji Gekken 1874 has some of the biggest splits of opinion I've seen between my Japanese anime-watching friends, and the opinions I can see on MAL or other places where non-Japanese anime fans gather.

Meiji Gekken has thus far gotten a COLD reception on MAL, sporting a putrid 6.48 score, and yet some of my Japanese friends (particularly history buffs) are pretty psyched about this show through the first 3 episodes.  The action scenes are well choreographed, the animation quality is solid, and the VA has been solid.

The reason for the split isn't hard to figure out... the show is very clearly written for a Japanese audience that's already familiar with late 19th-century Japanese history and doesn't hold your hand AT ALL, making it rather impenetrable to many viewers unfamiliar with the background.

This show is a cool late 19th-century period piece that covers some of Japan's dramatic moments in its history, so for those who want to get to know Japanese culture and history, I think this is a  really great show.  But to understand what's going on, you need some basic knowledge about 19th-century Japanese history that any Japanese viewer would be expected to know (and the show assumes that you know).

1. Japan was ruled by a stable relatively decentralized feudal de facto monarchy called the Shogunate.  The shoguns put Samuari on the top of society, who were lived off of pensions/salaries that each family held by hereditary right.  This system kept the peace for 250 years and led to a period of prosperity and economic growth, but growing dissatisfaction from merchants and peasants.
2. The Emperor continued to rule as the sovereign of Japan but in name only, as a symbolic figure.  The Emperor and the court weild little practical political power.|
3. Japan lived in isolation during this period, only trading with the outside world through a few ports.  All foreigners were barred from entering Japan except in these limited areas, and Japaense people were prohibited from leaving Japan.
4. In 1852 and 1855, Commodore Perry leads the Perry expedition, forcing Japan to open up its borders for trade and commerce at literal cannon point.  Britain, France, and numerous other Western nations follow, signing a series of ""Unequal treaties"" that forced unfavorable exchange rates on Japanese merchants.  Many Japanese are upset, and rally around the Emperor who was opposed to opening up Japan.
5. 2 regional lords of the Satsuma and Choshu provinces, also called the ""Sa-cho"" (from the first 2 letters of eacH) form an alliance that leads a successful coalition to persuade the Shogun to give up his power without a fight to the emperor.  For various political reasons, the Shogun agrees.  This is called the **Meiji Restoration,** as it restored the Emperor to a position of political power.
6. Some samurai who served under the Shogun refuse to accept this surrender that they see as a betrayal of their values, and continue to fight.  This leads to a civil war called the **Boshin War**.  The Imperial Forces are well funded and equipped with western rifles and cannons, and the Ex-Shogun forces (while also armed with guns and cannon, but fewer) are driven north.  Many surrender.
7. The last province to surrender to Imperial Government forces is Aizu Province, who fought to the bitter end.  The MC of Meiji Gekken is from Aizu.
8. Because of this bitter resistance to imperial rule, people from Aizu faced frequent discrimination for years after the Boshin War as the most disloyal citizens of the Emperor.
9. With the new Imperial government seated, and adopting Western-style governance and rule, the Samurai class begin to grow discontent as the Imperial government begin consider removing their special privileges from the Shogunate era, like their pensions and exclusive right to wear status symbols (katanas).  They even are no longer called Samurai but are given the title ""Shizoku.""  Meanwhile the central government views even such remaining privileges as being incompatible with Western Style governance that they want to adopt.
10. The Meiji Era is a period of rapid change as Japan sees itself as backward and begin aggressively importing both Western technology and Western culture and values.

In the opening scene, the protagonist  Shizuma is a samurai from Aizu and is fighting for the Shogunate forces in the Boshin War.  They are engaged in the last, futile resistance against the Imperial Army.  

Also know that most of the high government officials (Prime Minister Okubo and Minister of the Right Iwakura for example) are historical figures from history. As a shorthand, you can think people in western clothing in government are pro-reformist/pro-equality, those wearing kimonos are either lower class or anti-reform/Pro-Samurai (shizoku) privileges.

To anyone who has an interest in Japanese history and culture, I think this is a good show worth watching!

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
Kwokinator is a dirty based lolicon... Lain, get the men in black on him!! 
>""Myu-Myu claims that younger is better for girls. Please list three reasons why she's wrong!! We are all Hag lovers!!"" - sorry, lonely loli loli kami kourin, I can't hear you over the sounds of Ui BEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAM!!!



Specs64z is kinda right... The ""reflection"" period in Lain is often just ""check out these weird visuals.""
> I'm noticing that this anime doesn't really dedicate any time to reflect on things. Arguably that's part of the appeal, but it also leads to a number of ""sure that happened"" moments.


mgedmin apparently has thought that Lain's passiveness towards food was just that her mums cooking was minging. 
>> How would a hologram eat?

>IS THAT WHY WE ALWAYS SAW LAIN STIRRING HER SOUP WITH THE SPOON BUT NEVER SAW HER ACTUALLY PUT ANY FOOD IN HER MOUTH?

>But anyway, ""hologram"" is a fancy word, I don't think there are actual hologram projectors installed in her house, school, and everywhere in the city where Lain goes.  It's been established before that Lain can manipulate people's memories, through the 8 kHz resonance, so my theory is that whenever people think they see Lain, it's actually their memory being edited in real-time.


AlphaNull's little lore dump analysis of the episode!! 
> [I see two sides of this scene:](https://i.imgur.com/EX4as3Q.png)
   >""This is all real"" interpretation: Eiri manipulated everyone's memories (and perception) to strip away any connection Lain has to the physical world in order to encourage her to abandon her physical body
 > ""This is all psychosis"" interpretation: This scene is metaphorical. Lain is experiencing a paranoid delusion that she has nothing left and has been abandonded even by her closest friend. She states that she [""always tried not to say anything weird""](https://i.imgur.com/7lRISfX.png) because she always felt like this was a possibility, given her condition, but after one of her alters did said something horrible it doesn't matter how careful Bear Lain was. This is made all the worse because the person that she relied on the most, Arisu, wasn't there for her in that critical moment so Lain's mind leaped to ""she abandoned me on purpose"" hence [""Arisu"" saying this.](https://i.imgur.com/hG1D0dT.png)

Vaadwaur says [""daisuki!!""](https://youtu.be/RwG-Kg_JDdk?si=iibo4Hy5lPj0HbDC) 
>And now onto Vaad's special corner: What version of love did the anime use? Lain's father/the professors says 'daisuki', like a reasonable parent would. Karl also says 'daisuke'...which raises questions but there are acceptable reasons for that. Good ol' 'God', unfortunately, use 'ai shiteiru', which is what yanderes and other psychopaths say. He also wants Lain to 'aishita' back, which I think is almost as negative. Caveat here: The Japanese may not have been as hostile to Ai this far back, but then again Mai-HiME seems to have been...

JustAnswerAQuestion posted their full comment with info loredumps clearing up the discussions from yesterday. 

>  Some comments on yesterday's comments.

>The exposition was in 3 groups, flavor (UFOs), thematic (development of web and connectivity), and plot (Protocol 7).  You might think only the last one needed to be there.

>The plot critical points were Eri, Protocol 7, and the connecting of human minds to each other, and to the wired, via the resonant cavity between the Earth and the Ionosphere.  This connection allows any manifest existence in the weird to connect to people's minds.  This technomagic had a natural predecessor: marine mammals.

>Thematically, this connectivity was presaged by early networking attempts.  Machine networking, yes, but also pure information networking, like hypertext.

>Human psi, I am unsure on this point. The collective unconcious is theorized, but here, it is real. Via the Shumann resonance, which has always existed, people could touch each other's minds.  However, the psi in the show may also be a means of changing reality. Not sure.

>On that aspect, what is reality?  What is truth?  What is history?  The UFO story tells us that Truth and History are malleable.  So much more so, now, with people's mnids and the Wired linked in a bidirectional manner, much more intensely than through weak, natural psi.

>But this is not presented out of left field.  Eiri is presented as the last in a line people of who changed the world, starting with Vannevar Bush and MJ-12, the mysticism of Lilly and the hypertext of Ted Nelson, and the global wireless satellite network of Xanadu.

>Power lines make for fantastic ELF antennas. That's how he coupled the Wired to the global electromagnetic field. The power lines are everywhere.

>As for Taro and, in my first pass of the thread, somebody felt his speech was an indictment of ""One Truth"" but I read it as the opposite.  People lust after the One Truth.  Wouldn't you work for the Knights if they offered such a thing?

>Eiri's frog face at the end of yesterday's episode reminds me of [the Master Control Program.](https://www.google.com/search?q=tron+mcp&tbm=isch) 

And lastly from Vaadwaur

>I will only add that I think Eiri is trying to insert his 'truth' in at the end to retroactively make it a reality, like he becomes 'God' because he always was 'God' and history took a while to figure it out.

**Questions of the Day:**	

1) How close to Earth would you estimate the moon would have to be to cast such a well-defined shadow over such a large area for such a long period of time?

2) Is it any real shock that Pride's true form is a literal baby?

Bonus) I swear to fucking shit, I am so fucking over this series twisting reality around Ed to let him avoid having to kill that I'm on the verge of giving myself an ulcer.

Pokemon vs Digimon: Which had the better dub?,"In 1998 Pokemon was dubbed by 4kids entertainment and it was a hit in America at the time on the Kids WB network. While the dub has been the target of criticism and controversy throughout its history due to censorship and changes to the story . Despite these criticisms, most of the English dub is well-received, and has many viewers, some even preferring it over the original Japanese anime. Saban Entertainment and Fox Kids  in 1999 was try to find a show that could rival Pokemon and Kids WB in the ratings and the answer to that was Digimon. Digimon while revived some edits, they’re not as extreme as Pokemon and it was a huge success because of that.

The /r/anime Sweet 16 Fanart Contest!,"Hello everyone! As part of our Sweet 16/9 mill/Awards Extravaganza, we wanted to bring back an old favorite. The past fanart contests produced incredible works of art, such as /u/Earth2Mars's ""[CURIOUS](https://i.imgur.com/sE74IpQ.jpg)"", /u/manip21's tremendous ""[Gate of Karma](https://i.imgur.com/ZP3e2yH.jpg)"" (which remains @RedditChan's background to this day), and a [submission from /u/SrGrafo themselves](https://v.redd.it/chtpl6xezd531). I don't know how many of you know that even our thumbnails were created as the result of a contest, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5ak6p9/snoo_and_thumbnail_update/) (or to the left of any post).

With this long and great history of wonderful fanart being generated, we thought what better way to use [Reddit funding](https://files.catbox.moe/1vwh05.png) than to spark another round of inspiration and creativity?

#Rules and Guidelines

Your task is essentially the same as the [10th Anniversary Reddit-chan Fanart Contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/7raa3g/10th_anniversary_redditchan_fanart_contest/). Create fanart of (or including) our very own [Reddit-chan](https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/AQ_47wQPWDOEuP0LohFeFYpoa3fdLcqWrgIxDYvU_PI.png). You have free reign here, however, creativity will get you far. Here are a few more guidelines to follow.

* All fanart submitted must be your own work.
* All fanart submitted must depict our mascot [Reddit-chan](https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/AQ_47wQPWDOEuP0LohFeFYpoa3fdLcqWrgIxDYvU_PI.png) in a substantial way. You may include other anime characters, as long as they are not your OC.
* Only light NSFW material is allowed and must be tagged in the submission comment.
* Tracing is not allowed in any form.
* Digital and hand drawn fanart is allowed (No basic photoshop edits are allowed).
* Minimalistic/vector art is allowed, but cannot be traced
* No meme related work is allowed.


The **top three scorers** will receive the following prizes.

#Prizes

**1st Place - $200 Crunchyroll gift certificate**

**2nd Place - $100 Crunchyroll gift certificate**

**3rd Place - $50 Crunchyroll gift certificate**

***
Please note that these aren't just for Crunchyroll's streaming service (which would be a horrible ""prize""), they apply to most of [Crunchyroll's online store](https://store.crunchyroll.com/). Especially now after they've taken over RightStuf (RIP), you can have your pick of any number of manga, anime vinyl, and of course figures (if I won, I'd be eyeing [this one](https://store.crunchyroll.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-crunchyroll-master-catalog/default/dweb8c9891/rightstuf/4934054037759_figure-power-chainsaw-man-artfx-j-primary.jpg) 👀).

#Submission Details

We are doing something a little special for this contest. We know that fanart has had a bit of an up and down history with the subreddit, so we are relaxing the submission rules for fanart—only for fanart contest submissions.

**You may post your fanart contest submission as an image/link post, as long as it is appropriately flaired.**

Your submission must be in the form of a reddit post to /r/anime between now and the deadline of **March 25th, 2024**. Please ensure your contest entry post is flaired as ""Fanart Contest"". This is a new flair created for the purposes of this contest. Your post must abide by our fanart guidelines [as seen in our rules here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/rules#wiki_oc_fanart) **Contest entries will be allowed to made as an image post.** All spoiler-heavy images must be properly tagged according to our spoiler policy. You can only make one submission to the contest. If for whatever reason you submit multiple fanart pieces to the subreddit for the contest, only your first submission will be counted.

**Link your submission as a reply to the stickied comment below in this thread.** If you do not your submission will not be counted.

Your must have been created expressly for the purpose of this contest. You may not reuse your own content that was made before the announcement of this contest—self-plagiarism is plagiarism!

#Selection and Eligibility

The top three prize-winning entries will be selected by a panel of judges. They will be evaluating for difficulty of execution and degree of creativity. You may look at the submissions (and winners) of the [last Reddit-chan fanart contest for inspiration.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/7raa3g/10th_anniversary_redditchan_fanart_contest/dsvbidz/)

Now for a bit of disappointing news. Since these prizes are funded through Reddit, there are certain regional restrictions. Namely, in order to be eligible for prizes, you must be a legal resident of **the United States of America, the United Kingdom, or Canada (excluding Quebec)**. You must also meet /r/anime's new account restrictions, namely **be an account older than 8 days and have more than 10 karma**. You must not be banned from /r/anime (duh!) and must be in good standing with the community.

***

That's it! We thank everyone in advanced for participating. I know this stuff *isn't easy*, and the hard work that goes into each and every one of these pieces is both evident and appreciated. The last art contests we've had have produced some of my absolute favorite drawings, and I'm sure more of those will be created here.

I want to find an anime movie I watched a few years back,"I forgot most of it but I'm wondering if anyone would be able to help find it again. I saw it on Youtube, it was in Chinese,  It's set in a modern cyberpunk ish like place and the main character and his friends fight a lot of stuff. They probably had an intense fight near the end of the movie, and then it leads to the main character falling into a white space where there are thousands and thousands of pages. 
He finds out that those pages document the movie, breaking the fourth wall, and he then falls in the blank space to his death. 
It then cuts to a scene of his friends, where the guy dressed head to toe in blue is supporting the girl who i remember was dressed in purple.
I'm not sure if it was a billibilli creation or an actual movie, but hopefully it can shed a bit of light.",False,anime,1706197953.0,19fcfoz,Help

Looking for this old anime...,"Edit: FOUND IT! [OP of the anime in question ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-v7e5tg2YbQ)

This is hard for me to explain as my memory fails me and I was very young at the time but here goes, back when I was a kid (I'm 23 now) in my country the TV aired very few anime in our main cartoons channel, I remember very faintly them having this ""detective?"" anime, I remember more little bits (more like the melody) from the ending theme.

I say detective but it just felt mysterious and the the characters also sounded/looked very young like they were in school still and the anime style was very old too like... sailor moon kinda style..?

Also one of the main characters had blonde/light hair, I know this isn't much but if anyone could help me find this anime I would appreciate it so much, almost starting to believe it's not real but I still have the ending theme on my mind so I thought I'd ask for help and hopefully find an answer :')

When do you watch a Remake over the Original?,"I'm at the age where many of the classics I've seen (or missed) from my own childhood are getting modernized revisits, and I wanted to know where people fall on watching the more modern or ""classic"" take. To me it seems that some of these shows are so ingrained as classics that watching the more modern version is like watching the Robocop Reboot; probably fine but definitely a pale imitation of something really special at the time. At the same time, there are some of these shows that definitely suffer from a lot of nostalgia bias, or are getting remakes that are being made with a lot of love and respect for the source material. Best example I can think of is when past 90's OVA's got a ""proper"" adaptation in the 10's, specifically Jojo's and Hunter X Hunter, and the later shows are definitely classics in their own right.

Off the top of my head I can think of:

* Urusei Yatsura
* Sailor Moon Crystal
* Rurouni Kenshin
* Shaman King
* Kino's Journey (to a lesser extent)
* Spice & Wolf (soon)
* One Piece (coming up)

So, what do you usually do? Do you go back and explore the older show first? Do you generally default to the newer version? Do you somehow have the time for both? Or does it depend on a show by show basis, and if so, which shows do you think the new version is better than the old? Also, any examples that I missed?

In particular, I'm curious about what people think of new Urusei Yatsura and new Sailor Moon, because they are definitely old enough where the oldness can throw some newer people off, and they seem like they're very thoughtful adaptations but the older shows definitely have older qualities that the new ones are missing. Finally, I think the worst thing for me personally is if Spice & Wolf old and new end up being very good in significantly different ways, because I don't have the free time to justify trying to watch the same story twice.",False,anime,1706184881.0,19f7z6p,Discussion

86 Part 2 is mostly terrible,"PS: ""Please don't post LN spoilers""

Edit: Few corrections made in the post - Frederica is a kid, changed mystery to lore.

My review (thoughts) for both parts as follows:

**86 Part 1 - Rating - 9**This anime is not clear when it comes to combat presentation like you can't see what is happening clearly on screen many times, but communicates the message/emotions it wants to convey really well. High production quality & Amazing Animation. So depressing. Damn, why did they have to do that at the end?! 😭

**86 Part 2 - Rating 4**First of all, they made the first part ending meaningless by bring 86 back. Fine! At least we are happy they are alive!

In regards to this season, First two episodes were actually good, but it became a slog afterward. It was so boring/annoying to the point that I started skimming through one of the episodes to reach the climax. The main culprit is the mech fighting - it is still terrible. It is not a seamless presentation, and it is hard to see what is happening on the screen most of the time. It is just the weird angles and camera cuts coupled with the english sub. You have to put more effort to understand, because of these issues. I'm not going to put effort in watching it, if I'm not getting rewards for it. Because the plot is terrible as well.

The lore in part 2 isn't worth exploring either. Frederica is annoying AF. Also, why should we care about a character about whom we don't know anything about? Just because she is a kid? Don't remind me about Frederica's ghost!

The only reason I was watching was for the major to meet the 86. Got what I wanted at long last in the last two episodes. But still take an L. Terrible season with a satisfying ending made the score go from 3 to 4.

*Sorry, I'm not a native English speaker, so forgive me for any grammatical errors. These are just my thoughts that I noted down while watching the show.*

What do you think? Did you have similar feelings? or did you enjoy it more?

Goblin slayer question - is there only the simulcast version of season 2?,"Hello! 

Just wonder if there’s an uncut version of goblin slayer season two? I only see simulcast available on Funimation unlike season one with has uncut and simulcast, and I find it’s just a much less impactful or really good show without any of the gore or horror scenes like from the first season. 

Weird thing to want I know but I liked the show for it being dark and it’s just not! I’m about halfway through though so just let me know if it’s about to get dark again and I’m just a bit early lol I wanted to ask now before having to rewatch the entire season as an uncut version 

Is it on another streaming program or will it just come out later? I dont think I saw the option on Crunchyroll but maybe I just missed it of can’t see it since I don’t have a subscription to it

In search of an anime I dreamed of,"I had a dream today - a dream that I already had before. I dreamt about an anime, where the dream felt like watching a whole episode of it. It was so vivid that I can't dismiss it as just a fraction of my imagination, even though I am confident in my ability to imagine things. I'm making this post in the hope that someone recognizes the anime and can provide its name.

In the dream, the main character wore an alien suit with a mask that allowed him to communicate with it. It felt like an own character. I'm not sure about his motive for fighting, but it seemed like aliens had attacked planet Earth, and he fought them using the abilities of the suit he possessed.

He was searching for information, expressing his determination by saying something like, ""If they did all this just for fun, I'm going to kill them."" I recall a powerful scene where he walked down a passageway, repeatedly uttering ""revenge, revenge, revenge"" (""Fukushu"" in Japanese).

Simultaneously, there were side characters in a hospital, lying inside a capsule-like structure and undergoing testing. Some, if not all of them, seemed to be aliens who sided with humans or, at least, with the main character.

One female character from this group reached the roof after the test and called some kind of air vehicle that could fly. While she was trying to board it, a government official, possibly also female, destroyed the vehicle. She couldn't leave, and the government official intended to keep her under close watch. This angered the female character so much that she used her mental abilities to destroy the entire hospital, killing everyone in it (the animations were intense in that scene 😂). The government official panicked and immediately apologized for her behavior. She asked if she could restore the hospital to normal, offering the female character the freedom to leave without interference.

The female side character restored the hospital to normal, showcasing her power to manipulate time, and left in her vehicle, expressing a desire to see the main character with the mask.

That is my dream. Like I mentioned, it felt like I watched a whole episode of that show in Japanese dub, with exceptionally good animations and an old art style. It seems too clear and well-constructed to be just a dream, especially since my dreams tend to be somewhat awkward and random, which this one wasn't. Also, it wasn't the first time I dreamt exactly of this. Does anyone recognize this anime, perhaps?",False,anime,1706161928.0,19f2d90,Help

What should I watch after Death Note,"# Overview

Now, I wasn't satisfied with what I found on other posts, none of the answers include why that show specifically. That's why I have to tell you a few things I am not looking for, why I liked DN and what I am not looking for

&#x200B;

# Why I liked Death Note

I liked DN because:

1. Pacing - The story is pretty fast but not too fast, in the first episode you can see Light picking up the DN, reading some of the rules and testing the notebook, a fast strong start that tells you a lot about Light and the DN while not being overwhelming, in the second episode you already know his intention, if you don't know that in ep1 already and learn that Light is a very careful person and is already hiding the notebook very securely.
2. The characters - The characters are great, I loved how Light, L and Near are so intelligent. I liked how Light was half evil half good, having a good intention of killing the criminals and had a sense of justice.
3. The storytelling - I loved how this anime told it's story playing what the characters are thinking out loud
4. The genre - I like how it was a lot about human psychology and that it was a thriller
5. The music - I did not like the second half of the show's theme music. But seriously L's theme and the starting theme and ending theme of the first half of the show are masterpieces in my opinion.
6. Not much action - I liked how it didn't have much action
7. Plot-twists - A lot of plot-twists, for example Light joining the investigation.
8. The story - The story is very good.

# What I am not looking for

1. Long anime - I am not looking for anime longer then 50 episodes.
2. Anime with lots of action - I do not like action, I tried code geass and I did not like how much action there was
3. Slow paced anime - Anime with a really slow pacing
4. Too fastly paced anime - I do not want it to be overwhelming

Which anime do you think is in everyone's top 10?,"To contrast with the other thread, do you think there are certain anime which is in everyone's top 10 (assuming that they have watched it)?    
 
Rules of thumbs:    
1. Let's agree to judge the ANIME not the MANGA. So if an anime is unfinished, judge it based off the unfinished product. If the manga is better, still judge based on the anime.   
2. If an anime spans multiple seasons, try to count it all as one long product. For example, don't separate out Monogatari series into different parts.     
3. If an anime has different versions (FMA), judge it based on its most popular version (FMA Brotherhood).      
4. By ""everyone"", I'm taking a Western centric POV. So for example, I'm not expecting Detective Conan even though it's huge in Japan.

The entity proceeds to cause his death multiple times in increasingly different ways.

Help me get back into anime!,"**Don't hesitate to drop recommendations even if they don't exactly match anything on this post. Maybe I could use a game changer.**

A time ago I was reallllly into anime. But I mostly dropped it 3 or 4 years ago to focus more on other things. Now I've been considering getting back into it, I hear there's a lot of new amazing titles out - and I'm sure a plethora of old ones that I'd be really into that I've missed.

I can be a little picky, at least I was - maybe my tastes have opened up more now. A big problem I had with anime was how perverted or extremelyyyy generically tropey they could be. Understand that this is pretty... Ubiquitous in most anime tho, so maybe disregard that preference if the anime is good enough. I liked anime that subverted conventional tropes or expectations with how bizarre they could get, and I love it when anime blends some sort of psychological aspect into the mix or is trying to give the viewer a message.

**Some of my favorites:** *FLCL, Hellsing Ultimate, Gurren Lagann, Welcome to the N.H.K!, Sonny Boy,* and *The End of Evangelion*. I'd put *Steins;Gate* as a favorite definitely... But I haven't seen the anime, I played the visual novel.

**Others that are nearly favorites:** *Welcome to Dr. Irabu's Office, Violet Evergarden, Nichijou,  Now And Then Here And There, Berserk* (1997)*, Made in Abyss* (Yes! I need to watch season 2!), *Gankutsuo: The Count of Monte Cristo,* and *Promare*.

What are your thoughts on Mobile Suit Gundam?,"I would argue that there is no anime franchise that is more iconic and influential than that of *Mobile Suit Gundam*. It is the face of Mecha anime and the name most people think of when the genre is brought up. It is also infamously long and notoriously hard to get into (Good luck getting your friends to watch low quality animation by late 70s standards if they won't even watch high quality animation by 90s standards). Still its influence is undeniable and it still maintains a solid fanbase who will live and die by the franchise.

I find given the nature of the franchise, most people online fall into one of two camps: they haven't seen Gundam or they really REALLY love Gundam. However, in my own experience I've found that like any franchise, Gundam isn't without its highs and lows, both of which get smoothed over with a simple dicotemy like that. So I want to open up the floor to more nuanced takes and see just what the general masses think of the franchise that launched a thousand gunpla.

So, have you watched any *Mobile Suit Gundam* series? If so, how much and what do you like and/or dislike the most about the franchise? What are the best and worst Gundam entries? Why is *MS IGLOO* actually kinda based? What do you think is the biggest factor holding people back from watching Gundam? If you haven't yet hopped into Gundam, what's been the biggest thing holding you back? ",False,anime,1706134905.0,19et5bt,Discussion

Man Yoshiyuki Tomino does not hold back when it comes to melancholy,"Just saying that as I got Aura Battler Dunbine a couple of months ago, and holy cow does it get dark fast as after at least 14 episodes, the tone changes hard as without giving too much away, I will just say that things don’t go too well for him when he returns to Japan.




True, the show might have some odd parts in it such as the character names, or how people in Byston Wells can understand a man from Japan who only speaks in Japanese, but man has the show been really engaging to watch as it has that standard Tomino style where things go well at first, but then the plot goes hectic real fast as ABD does not hesitate to show how a man can be misunderstood within his own country.




I don’t know if I can gush about the show here as I’ve seen about 20 episodes so far, but I just wanted to share my appreciation of it as while I do miss when Tomino used to make anime, I have heard that there have been directors in the modern anime scene that can replicate his show (no pun intended) no mercy style as I like anime series that can catch people off guard with a huge tone shift as sometimes there are shows that start off fairly peaceful, but then get dark all of a sudden as those shows are fascinating to me personally.",False,anime,1706134111.0,19estph,Discussion

#Comment of the Day!! 
 
3blah believes narration clips aren't based
>I covered some of it already.  An uncharitable reading might be that it's to pad out some of the runtime.  I don't
think it's a spoiler to say that we'll come back around to some of this stuff, but not necessarily all of it -- you
could say that about just about anything we've seen so far.  Maybe it's a way to tell the certain people that are
watching ""We get you, man. Isn't this deep?""  Maybe it's a different way to do an infodump; we've had a number of
these already, and doing it this way makes it feel like we are researching these things on the internet along with Lain.


Mgedmin is being affected by the curse of the Wired... Is he gonna get Mika'd? 
> Also, what happened to the ED visuals?  My GNOME desktop suddenly lost the ability to update the picture on the external screen and it's now saying ""to Be continued"", forever.  Playing with the display cable didn't help, I had to power-cycle the monitor itself.  Ominous.


SMSmith was blown away with our new reveals!! And our cute little grey bro! 
>Holy shit, the green/red stripe shirt finally showed up and it’s an alien???  Wait did this whole episode just describe how the Wired was created and the humming is the 8Hz frequency connecting everyone?? 🤯


Kwokinator is waiting for the aliens to take us in and welcome us to the greater universe. 
> Did the extended Area 51 chats mean anything to you or do you still just see it as the funneh alien UFO zone? - both can be possible. Aliens have always existed, it's just now that Lain has evolved enough for aliens to detect and acknowledge

Weedwacker legit blew me away... I know I shouldn't be saying that as host, but I never had aliens on my radar. 

>  The Roswell UFO incident and Majestic 12 are referenced to imply that The Wired originated from alien technology or influence, by bringing up Vannevar Bush's connection to Majestic 12.
Vannevar Bush was a real (and very interesting, and unrelated to George Bush) scientist who did lots of work involving microfilm, and theorized that technological advances would allow a ""Memex"" device that could store and access all information, and that such technology would change how we think.  Presaging and inspiring many advances in computing.  Basically every guy who was working on Hypertext systems in the next few decades said they were inspired by him.

Recommend me an Anime that would legitimately make tear up.,"Something that takes its characters seriously. None of that forced crap where a character dies in 20 seconds that I knew for all of 20 minutes and had no emotional attachment to. I’ve watched Clannad, but that did nothing for me. It was too anime tropy for me. Good story, but found moments to be kinda cringey. 

I want something like Avatar the Last Airbender. A scene akin to Zuko apologizing to his uncle for betraying him. We’ve been with those characters, know them, are attached to them. They’re beautifully written and acted. That moment truly tugged at my heartstrings and got a legitimate, earned tear out of me.",False,anime,1706129837.0,19er2sa,What to Watch?
Berserk aka STRAIGHT TESTOSTERONE SIMULATOR,"One of my favorite mangas is Berserk created by Kentaro Miura a man who never not looked happy and who had a crippling addiction to Idolmaster, I'm not even joking about that last part, it was actually believed that any time Berserk went on hiatus is because Miura was too busy playing the new Idolmaster games to focus on writing a new chapter. It's funny, Miura was such a private man that there are hardly any pictures of him online yet everyone knows how obsessed he was with Idolmaster, somewhere in a different reality instead of creating Berserk, he created the best Idol manga ever.

So for those of you who have never watched Berserk before, it's a super dark fantasy manga/anime about a roaming merc named Guts killing demons and searching for the man responsible for his suffering so he can kill him in the most brutal way possible. Now as someone who's seen the animes and read the manga, I stand by the statement that while Berserk may not be the best anime in the world, it's definitely one of the best mangas in the world. And I'm not just talking about the story or characters, the artwork is a straight-up masterpiece, there are so many iconic panels in Berserk they should be hanging up in museums.

Anyway, I wanted to talk about Berserk 1997, the best Berserk adaption we'll ever get. It starts off just like any D&D campaign, in a tavern with a group of guys who look like they have a subscription to ugly bastards weekly, harassing an innocent barmaid and her grandfather. Yeah, very clearly these guys need to die, and die they do, when our hero Guts, a man who looks like he can break stone with his chin, enters and massacres them. Shoots a few of them up with arrows but the real golden chainsaw goes to the last guy after Guts takes him out with his priced sword, the Dragon Slayer, a sword so badass it even has its own introduction.

He tells the only survivor to go let his boss know the Black Swordsman is coming for him, and yes, Berserk came out before SAO so Kirito's scrawly ass stole it from Guts.

So Guts leaves and has one of those PTSD nightmares, it is pretty terrifying.

We later catch up with the big bad of this episode, the most horrifying thing you can imagine...a bald guy. Oh and he's like a snake demon too. So he hears about Guts and gets pissed, so pissed that he decides to destroy the village he's lording over. Luckily Guts shows up and the two have a fight that Guts totally won but the demon is a rotten loser and transforms.

He knocks Guts around a few times, disarms him of his sword but makes the mistake of not disarming him of his prosthetic arm cuz that fake arm doubles as a real cannon. Guts blasts him in the face, chops him in half, and puts the jackass in an early grave. Then we flashback to the past and a very young Guts.

So that's about it, I believe Berserk 1997 is the best adaption we'll ever get. I really love the story and think Berserk is a masterpiece. It takes a huge risk by setting up a story with Guts as a demon hunter then taking a turn and spending the majority of the timeline in the past with a story about political espionage, self-discovery, war, human suffering, the supernatural doesn't even show up until like 20 episodes in when Zodd pops up to shake things up. Anyway go watch Berserk, it's for free on YouTube.",False,anime,1706127081.0,19epyht,Writing

"General Question, What should I tell someone who classified Anime the same as Cartoon and TV Shows??","Hey guys, it really bugs me every time when someone says that Anime is Cartoon or TV Show, sometimes even As Movies.

Their very and one and the only reasoning is that Anime get's broadcasted on Television.

Which means Anime are TV Show. It does not matter what I said and how I compare or note that there are other mediums or platform to broadcast anything in the form of videos, like Streaming services, Netflix, Youtube. Smart phones, Radios. Or types of media, like movies, short films etc. So if a porn somehow got broadcasted on TV, they will consider it as a TV show too. To them, TV Shows are TV Shows, TV series are TV Series.

There were just so convinced that by the fact that Anime are Broadcasted on the Television.

Trying to find a old Ecchi anime,"I’m trying to remember the name of an old Ecchi anime from when I was younger. I remember some key details from it too.

The main girl had pink hair

It was from the 2000’s 

It was a Ecchi Harem anime

It had the characters go to school

The first part of the opening episode had the pink hair girl had a panty shot and got angel wings

It had 1 episode where the main character was tied up and in his swim suit

Another episode where it was raining and the main character helped out another girl apart of the Harem

There was a trio of girls who were the antagonist who hated the main character 

And finally I believe there was a OVA where the main characters went to the where it was uncensored and you got to see everything. 

And also in that OVA too the trio of girls piloted a robot

For a while I thought it was called Girls Bravo but it just showed me Bravo Girls. Another show I thought it might be was Heaven's Lost Property but the animation was too good to be that. The animation in the show I’m looking for is like early to mid 2000’s anime where it looked shiny and flat, similar to looking like elfin lied (and also no it’s not Elfin lied either it wasn’t gory).

S1 Episode 5 – The Holy Warrior

ANSWER TODAY’S QUESTION(S)

If you were transported to another world, which reaction would you more likely have: Maniwa's, or Ikari's?

Did you ever think we would get a video game episode out of this show?

Bonus) Who would win in a fight: Holy Warrior, God Warrior, or The Ultimate Warrior?

Bonus 2) With the two detectives being transported into a video game world, does this technically make the show now an isekai?

Tried watching The New World but Ive kinda tapped out midway, it just didnt click for me.

- Harry Potter (both)

Recomend finished anime with OP MC,"Hi there good people, i have watched quite a lot of anime lately and although i wibe with a lot of them (a lot of isekai, prog fantasy, OP MCs)  but im fed up with one or two seasons and neverending waiting. Recently i watched Arifureta wich i liked. Somewhat dickish OP MC (like shield hero season one) is nice food. But it is not finished. Like there is nothing with end. Isekai is basically never a finished show aside from old clasics like Magic night Rayearth or Hack.

So, recomend me some FINISHED (not canceled or on hiatus or Berserk) anime with OP MC, preferably with dickish personality but not necesary.  Can be fantasy, isekai, scify, whatever category Slime was.... i dont really care. 

Im kinda boomer in this.  In ye old times i feel like there were so many shows that told its story in season or two and now everything is Naruto (i love naruto but when i started it it was allmost over). I dont know how to navigate this anime climate. I did not watch much for a few years and its just copletely different climate now.

Recommendations for similar anime please?,"Hi all!

Do you guys have any recommendations for Anime like these, and these reasons (doesn't have to be the same genre):

* **Solo Leveling**
   * Serious & dark (but not Shield Hero dark) beginning, undertone of mystery and intrigue of future events, fantastic art helps deliver on all of the above. There's also a real sense of progression for MC's power and story both.
   * Ofc the show is new with only a few episodes out, but it reminds me of Berserk of Gluttony but better (so far)
* **Apothecary Diaries** / **The Saint's Magic Power is Omnipotent**
   * Female MC that's not OP (in combat), emphasizing everyday stuff like research & studying & relationships with a budding romance, without being only about the romance either
   * A good, strong guy protecting the MC for that daww <3
* **World Trigger**
   * Just fantastic in every way, esp high internal consistency and logic behind every person & event, also an interesting story with progression

Also one last weird question: I just started watching Absolute Duo (not convinced so far but nvm that). In the first episode \[Spoilers: Absolute Duo s01e01\] >!the school forces the students to fight their partner, and only the winner gets admitted. I couldn't help but think: what if the MC had simply lost on purpose because: 1) the school lied and set those conditions to force the students to give their best so they could be measured for their potential, but were really going to allow admittance to both either way, or 2) the school really did use arbitrary, unreliable, even cruel methods to disqualify potentially brilliant students, in which case it didn't live up to its reputation and the MC would rather just take their skills elsewhere instead. Either way, from the MC's PoV losing would be the right choice.!<

Is there any anime where the MC openly stands up to and criticizes flawed systems and authorities regardless of consequences, but is also strong enough to be able to afford to, even force the systems and authority figures themselves to change for better in the end? So the story would revolve around that? I know this is a weird question, but this is something of a recurring pet peeve of mine about a lot of shows and games too where I wish some shows handled it like this! The Irregular at Magic High School kinda touches on this idea, but not really.

Thank you all in advance!

Edit: Oh and bonus points if it's available on Crunchy in Europe! Thanks!",False,anime,1707323758.0,1al73qc,What to Watch?

Trying to find a old show.,Ok I have been asking friends and acquaintances for years and still can't find this show. I'm 80% sure it was an anime and not a cartoon. It was on Cartoon Network (mid 90's-early 2000's). All I remember about the show is the characters would touch any kind of matter and it would break it down into different weapons. One guy had glowing spheres that floated around him and would launch at people. Another had a glowing sword that looked like a bar of light. Stuff like that. Does anyone have any recollection of this show? It's been driving me crazy for years 😂.,False,anime,1707318142.0,1al4xc5,Help

On the one hand, I love all of the Japanese signs, on the other, I feel conflicted about how Itsuomi treats Yuki. I showed my mom and she felt like he was rude to touch her so much and get up in her face, but also loved how he actively wanted to learn her language, and seems to be invested in actively using it with her.

She said Oushi is ""typical over protective hearie."" She could definitely relate to Yuki's family not knowing sign, as my grandparents (while incredibly progressive about it for their time in other areas) also never learned her language. I'd love to hear other opinions!!!

"Searching for something light hearted, romance story, slice of life, comedy","Hi guys, this is my anime list: [https://myanimelist.net/profile/perrycotto](https://myanimelist.net/profile/perrycotto)

Refently I saturated my favourite anime to watch and currently I‘ve binged Frieren both anime and manga, I have to say that i absolutely didn’t thought it could hook me so much, the animation is superb, character are well designed and their chemistry is great, I especially love how well it balances action, adventure and [Iyashikei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iyashikei)  vibes.

I‘ve taken this example because it encompass very well what I search in anime, something that is visually appealing (mushishi, mob psycho, bungou stray dogs, vivy fluorite song, nichijou, berserk the old one, ghost in the shell); has a solid engaging story that isn’t predictable unlike anime such as Black Clover or Shield Hero (my brain still hurts); has a certain level of attention for soundtrack and music (i don’t expect something as vivy fluorite, beck or the amazing Takt Op.).   


You will see that i’m missing a lot of classics like Code Geass but I really can’t stand that style of animation and sadly for me it’s a deal breaker even if the anime is good. I‘m not expecting bones, madhouse or mbappa level of animation every single episode, hell I’ve enjoyed Pop team epic, inferno cop and other weird anime because of their creativity and smart use of simple animation to deliver great story or great action / funny scenes. 

While i’ve said that i enjoy the [Iyashikei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iyashikei) genre I tend to get bored quickly as my level of attention has been dramatically abused by the fast paced and action packed genre. Masterpieces as Mushishi of Aria are surely great but I consume them very slowly and occasionally. 

Ideally I would search something with the story of Fruit Basket, the animation that can span from Great Teacher Onizuka (one of my favourite of all time, I’ve read everything from the author) to the much modern Heavenly Delusion (which was sadly a delusion), the comedy of Nichijou, Full Metal Panic or Golden Boy or Love is war.

I’m aware of great suggestions such as Yuru Camp, Place further than the universe, Toradora, Wonder Egg Priority, The Melancholy of... etc but for now i’m searching something else. 

I’m more than open to other suggestions of other genre the only condition is that i’m asking you your really favourite and best and most emotional anime the you hold dear.

thanks everyone !

I want to get into Anime more and I need some suggestions based on my preferences: 
- As you can tell from my list, I definitely lean towards action, but I am willing to watch a show with less action if the story is that good. 
- I prefer cool lore & world-building over anything else. 
- Please don’t roast me for this one, but I don’t like when most of the characters or the MC look like literal children, but are adults, it really throws me off. If just a couple characters are like that, then it’s fine.

Would you recommend/re-watch Highschool of the Dead?,"Lemme explain.

Is a very entertaining anime. With a great production quality. And the journey the main characters do towards adulthood and responsibility, while embracing their emotions and their ups and downs, is something between great and amazing (still trying to decide one of them) There's so much to learn from it.

However, there's a ""but..."". Female characters are beautiful and that's Ok. But their outfits are totally objectifying, and even more many gratuitous situations. And every shot where they appear is just fan service. It isn't something that happens a scene or two. Cannot be skipped, is just everywhere.

For me it's a pity that an anime of this quality seems to be so addressed to male audiences. Hence the question. I'm not sure me (as a guy) would even feel totally comfortable re-watching it.

Ongoing Anime Hunt (All help is appreciated),"MY FIRST POST

Okay, so I'll do this as best as I can. 

I was like 12, scrolling through animes as a 12 year old girl would on YouTube. 

I know there were better apps, not the point.

What do i even call this genre? / Any guesses to what anime this might be?,"Hi! Im trying to remember some god awful anime i saw when i was a kid ... unfortunately i cant even type search words in to google images to try to trigger a memory because i have no clue what to call this genre...

Its a child male anime protaganist who's main antagonist is himself, aged up, as a teenager/young man. The two versions of him have different personalities in the same body, seperate awareness.( I know its Definitely not Yu-Gi-Oh, i would recognize the hair. ) This was just some generic looking black hair school uniform Anime guy. I dont really know what to call this trope or genre where i guess the main character has split personality or two souls in one body? Its not a writing trick to have the character talk to himself for exposition or mental issue like multiple personality disorder because when the older personality takes over it PHYSICALLY  changes the child's body into the older copy. Magic. Poof. 

Help me out here...?  What do i search for this kind of genre?  If memory serves right, maybe hes a vampire or something?  Does anyone have any guesses what it might be? There cant be that many anime where the main lead is two people in the same body.  

.... And saying that now, theres a ton that come to mind.. aaaa Its not bleach... Cant be inuyasha... Nothing mainstream. Probably. It would have to be a battle action series... I dont watch sol at all.  Please help and thankyou. Any guessses?",False,anime,1707294037.0,1aky7x7,Help

What anime would be the best visual novel?,"Imagine if an anime was adapted as a visual novel with all the visual novel effects, soundtracks, and most importantly, routes, letting you explore different options and what could happen. Some visual novels could incorporate some gameplay aspects too where how you perform can change outcomes.

What are some anime that would benefit from this? And please no boring answers like anime adapted from a visual novel (Clannad, Steins Gate, Fate, Higurashi, Danganronpa)

For me, a harem would be an obvious choice. Something like the **Quintuplets** would be nice to see the routes of each girl.

**Renai Flops** would be fantastic as a VN, especially with the twist so you can go different routes to see what they could do with the twist which I can't spoil.

Other than harem, I think Hyouka would be an amazing VN because of the different possible aspects, events, and maybe it could have a cool little detective minigame gameplay.

Shadows House would be amazing too for the same reasons.

Yuru Camp would be really boring but maybe they could pull it off like having stunning scenery or having different campgrounds as your routes would be really cool.

Saekano, mostly because it's parodying VN games.

Amagi Brilliant Park, would be a cool feature to see if you can save the park in time and have different routes to check out the different park aspects and stuff.

Komi and Hitoribocchi see how many friends you can make lol.

Re Zero and other time travel anime would be super cool too.

Do the big three deserve remakes? (Kai treatment),"Kinda like how One Piece is getting that remake in the future, do bleach and Naruto deserve getting a remake as well? Compared to something modern like Demon Slayer that had pretty good pacing and no fillers, I personally think bigger shows that were made in the time of fillers should get at the very least a “Kai” version, if not a whole revamped remake. Like if Naruto had all filler cut out, was compacted into something easier to swallow, and had new shiny animation. Maybe that’s what studio Pierrot is gonna test out with those special episodes of Naruto they were making.

Help me find this anime.,"I have a vague recollection of an anime I once saw on TV when I was a kid and would like to find where it was from.

There are 4 characters in the scene, all of them female. 3 of them seem to be ""evil"" with dark colors and the like and they're draining the energy of a 4th seemingly ""good"" character (bright colors). At one point, the background becomes red/orange and the three villains form a triangle with the victim in the center.

I also remember them transforming into butterfly like creatures, altough I can't remember whether is was just the villains, the victim or all of them.

Given I was a kid and I think it was around the time Rurouni Kenshin was on TV, it has to be late 90s early 2000s. I live in Belgium mind you, so it has to be aired outside of Japan and most likely has an English dub.",False,anime,1707229125.0,1akat1c,Help

Can anyone help me indentify an anime I watched as a child?,"Hi, I just remember this one specific scene from an anime I watched as a child, if someone could help me identify the name of the anime, that would be amazing. I think I was watching it around late 1990s early 2000s on the channel animax.

The protagonist is a girl who has magic powers. She's not a child but maybe a teenager. She had short dark hair. She has a best friend who's got longer hair and both of them have boyfriends.

The scene I remember is that she's on a call with her boyfriend and he's confessing his feelings to her, but she somehow astro travels to him. She can see him, but he cannot and that's when she discovers this new power. She's trying to tell him about her power and he's trying to confess his feelings.

Another scene I remember is that she tells this to her best friend and in the night she, her best friend, best friend's boyfriend and the protagonist's boyfriend meet by a hill. The protagonist conjures two flying carriages and they each go in one with their boyfriends taking in the night view of the city.

I've been looking for this anime for years, but haven't been able to identify the anime.

Anime Series in Limbo: Did you forget about these anime too?,"I'm sure many of you have watched numerous anime series, and it's easy to lose track of some over time. We eagerly wait for new seasons, only to eventually forget about certain shows. I'd like to inquire about anime whose current status is uncertain, and, likely, they won't be renewed. As I was going through my list I was surprised by the number of shows I forgot about:

* No Game No Life (I know a lot of people didn't forget about this, but the studio did)
* Gosick (Mystery)
* Seitokai Yakuindomo (Depends on GoHands)
* Noragami
* Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress (Anime Original, So it depends on Wit Studio)
* Gakuen Babysitters (Wholesome)
* Nichijou
* Kono Oto Tomare (The music gives me goosebumps)
* How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom (The only isekai-harem anime that ain't mid)
* Barakamon
* Burning Kabaddi
* Gin no Saji (Silver Spoon)
* Demi-chan wa Kataritai (more satou sensei x takahashi sensei)
* Tanaka-kun is Always Listless
* Senryuu Shoujo
* D-frag!
* We never learn (We need the endings animated)
* Tokyo Ghoul (We only got the first season right? Yup! Season 2 isn't announced yet.)

Also, feel free to correct me if you have any news regarding the above anime.

P.S. I know some of the shows above have lost popularity or have poor sales. But still, I wish they had continued. Out of all these anime, I'm genuinely frustrated with Gosick as it was released during the ""2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami"" which was the most powerful earthquake in Japan (source: Wikipedia). So not a lot of people watched it and wasn't that popular. The author of the novels kept writing the books, so now I've decided to study Japanese to read them as they are not translated.

Yu Yu Hakusho (the whole journey to the end)

A Silent Voice (both the anime & the manga)

Erased

Death Note (want to fall in love with anime again because it was my gateway anime)

There're many other anime that are in my 10/10 list but didn't mention because the above list is for the shows that I wish to experience for the first time again, not want to cry ugly or be depressed for weeks. For eg. Madoka Magica, Shin Sekai Yori, Evangelion, Violet Evergarden, Grave Of The Fireflies etc etc are the best examples of ""worth watching once, but not twice because you don't have the courage to go through that same phase again"" but only Clannad is the exception here (for me atleast).

Anime being released in chunks,"What do you guys think about anime that gets released in large chunks? Like bleach TTYBW and JoJo’s Stone ocean. I personally think that it really kills all the momentum a show has as well as the hype it has. Bleach being separated feels a bit weird but in the end since it gets released weekly when it is airing does a lot to keep it relevant. However stone ocean imo had 0 hype at all because when its parts came out, all the episodes came out at once. That honestly is the killer combo I think, being released in parts but also all at once lets people binge all of it and it loses all hype and relevancy in like a week. Compare stone ocean to Golden Wind and it’s like night and day in that aspect. Every episode of golden wind felt like an event for its viewers to discuss and make memes about what happened that week, but with stone ocean I didn’t feel any of that. Weekly is def the way to go, not at once or in chunks. (Not talking about seasons, just seasons that are cut up in parts)

Thoughts On The Dorohedoro anime....,"I was a little surprised and honestly intrigued when the Dorohedoro anime adaption was announced a few years ago. However, I knew I would probably end up being disappointed. It's not because of the CG (although I'm not a CG fan). And it's not that it's terrible, because it isn't. I've just always felt that Q Hayashida's work is so distinct as far as art style, and that it actually loses a lot of charm and identity when it's not in black and white. The art of the manga hooked me immediately, and the unique story and characters kept me invested. It was the same with Dai Dark.

Classroom of the Elite Character Recap (Up to S3 Episode 5)," Series naturally has a lot of characters and I saw some people were confused so thought I’d drop this to give some refreshers for anyone who forgot who’s who. Not gonna mention anything that hasn’t been in the anime (S3 episode 5) up to this point. There’s a lot of moving plot lines at once so will give a brief summary of what their current or recent situation is along with what we know so far. As a side note almost every character here is usually referred to by their last name so I wouldn’t bother trying to remember their first name to make things easier. Limited to 20 pics so will drop for the ones who are newer or more forgettable

**Class C (formerly Class D)**

Kiyotaka Ayanokoji - Not much to say here (will be referring to him as Kiyo for the rest of this post)

Suzune Horikita - Has slowly been growing as a leader since season 1, has a big inferiority complex over her brother thus is constantly trying to be like him, wants Kushida to put her talents to use for the class but has not had any luck convincing her

Kikyo Kushida - Two faced, destroyed her class in middle school by leaking everybody’s secrets, wants Kiyo and Suzune expelled as a result of knowing this, was willing to work with Ryuuen in S2 and recently was said to be in contact with Nagumo, leaked some class secrets to Kiyo in the recent ep as part of a deal. Kiyo wants to expel her because she’s a nuisance

Kei Karuizawa - Bullied in the past, does some dirty work for Kiyo in exchange to being protected by him and seems to be catching some feelings for him, broke up with Hirata recently

Yosuke Hirata - The cool, popular and reliable guy of the class

Rokusuke Koenji - Complete wild card who does whatever he wants, seems to have very competent abilities but we don’t know to what extent, recently figured out Kiyo defeated Ryuuen just by feeling the grip of his hand

Ken Sudo - Sports jock, has a crush on Suzune, is trying to improve academically to not burden the class

Haruki Yamauchi - Dickhead

Airi Sakura - Shy and meek, used to be an idol. Not much screentime since season 1 but she was saved from a creepy staff member by Kiyo and has liked him since. Joined the ‘Ayanokoji Group’ in season 2 along with the next 3 characters 

Teruhiko Yukimura - One of the smarter characters in the class, was in Kiyo’s group on the first exams of S2 and S3. Self conscious about his lack of physical ability and wants to be beneficial to the class. Prefers to be called “Keisei” by his friends in the Ayano Group

Others: Most of the rest are just background characters for now so I wouldn’t worry about them, there is a girl with a red hair clip named Shinohara who Ike defended from the rumors in S3 recently, there’s also an anime nerd with glasses named Sotomura who a lot of people call the ‘Professor’.

 

**Class D (formerly Class C)**

Kakeru Ryuuen - After getting defeated by Kiyo in season 2 is currently dejected and unmotivated

**Class B**

Honami Ichinose - Queen bee of her class that is trusted and liked by pretty much everyone, leads her class with a ‘power of friendship’ like vibe. Recently was down in the dumps over her shoplifting past being dug up but was able to get back on her feet and own it after assistance from Kiyo

&#x200B;

**Class A** 

Arisu Sakyanagi - Arrogant type, leads with mind games and trickery, knows about the “White Room” where Kiyo was raised and is interested in defeating him as she calls him a “false genius” created by his father.

Kohei Katsuragi - Bald guy. In season 1 Class A was split between the Sakayanagi and Katsuragi factions, after he fumbled the exam he lost almost all influence thus Sakayanagi is widely seen as the class leader after that

Totsuka Yahiko - Basically the only Katsuragi dickrider left in the class

Miyabi Nagumo - Newly inducted student council president, everyone in the second year is said to be in the palm of his hand, is said to want to do things very differently than how the school has been ran thus far and that there will likely be a lot of expulsions next year as a result.

Nazuna Asahina - One of the few in the second year that doesn’t seem to be a Nagumo dickrider and said she kind of wants to see him be humbled, gave Kiyo some information after he found her dropped hairpin

Ikuto Kiriyama - Vice president of the student council and is secretly loyal to Manabu, was ordered to help give Kiyo information about the second years to help take down Nagumo but doubts his capabilities. Recently helped Kiyo spread rumors given to him by Kushida on the school message boards

Why? A character straight out asked in the last episode I watched, and the answer was “he’s special”. Which he definitively is, just not in a good way. Why do these nobles and people of culture fall in love with this guy after a couple of days? It feels like the characters just act however the story needs them to act to get in the direction it needs to go, no matter how unreasonable or weird.

Is the sign language in A Sign of Affection accurate?,"I'm sorry if this has been asked before but if it had I couldn't find it. 

While watching the first episode of  A Sign for Affection, my wife and  I quickly picked up on the use of  sign language in the opening credits, and enjoyed its use throughout the episode. However, my wife  who knows some American Sign Language  was a bit confused by how some of the signs were used, so we don't think it's that. Is this Japanese Sign Language, and if so it's it accurate?

Edit: To those asking, no I did not think they would use ASL in an anime, though I admit I was not aware of JSL until I saw this anime and looked it up. I was asking IF the JSL in this anime was legit or did the creators make up random signs rather than use  JSL. I don't sign it  so I did not know, and sadly the cynic in me would belive that someone would make up signs rather than do the work to make sure what they use is appropriate.

My bf wants me to watch an anime with him and I’ve never seen any anime before. Which should I choose?,"He said I should pick between hunter hunter, demon slayer, jujutsu kaisen, or attack on titan. 

I don’t really enjoy cartoons or reading subtitles or fantasy but I do want to try to get into it for him😭

Edit - a few things: 
My bf isn’t a huge anime buff like I’m sure most of you are, many of you are saying these are basic which is fine, he just started getting into it and is excited and wants to share it with me! Thank you for the suggestions on anime that are more in line with different interests. 

As for what I usually watch, my favourite genre for shows is sitcoms, but I also like drama and romance. 

Edit 2 - wow thank you all for your answers! I’ll come back to this post over the next while as I deliberate what to watch, so many helpful answers :)

Update I told him about my post and all these answers and he said he would enjoy if I watched one from the list because of how much he loves all of these and wants to see if, when I watch them, I will also enjoy it with him. But he also said he wants to find other shows as well that we could both get into that are more my speed genre-wise. All these responses will really help! I haven’t decided which one from the list I most want to watch but so far from what I’ve read from u guys I’m leaning towards either hunter x hunter or demon slayer. 

Another edit okay I’m still leaning towards demon slayer but haven’t decided fully yet. I’m going to watch one of these first (despite all the comments saying they’re bad starter animes) because I want to try to get into something he loves, which are these animes. Some of the ones I’m planning on looking into, based on what seem to be the most popular recommendations here, are your name, my hero academia, apothecary diaries, spy x family, cowboy bebop, howls moving castle, and violet evergarden. I really am shocked this post got so much attention but thank you all for your responses to me! 

He also doesn’t really want to watch them with dubs but I think I’m going to tell him to deal with it because many of you are saying the dubs are fine for the most part and I think I’ll be a lot more likely to stay engaged that way",False,anime,1707182820.0,1ajxok3,What to Watch?

I'm looking for an anime that has a lot of combat. But isn't so much a power creep like DBZ or Naruto is. I'm after something where creativity and wit is what comes out on top. Or even something like Pokemon, where fire beats grass yadda yadda. 

Just something where the focus isn't might makes right. Some power creep is to be expected, and I'm cool with that. I don't watch a lot. So aside from big names, I likely haven't seen it.

what is the real life inspiration behind Blue exorcist's Shima and this spoilers fellow from Noragami?,"**\*\*\* manga spoilers of Noragami \*\*\* I'm personally reading it right now and I'm only at ch49.**

I figure there must a culture reference that inspired these 2 fellas. They give similar vibes. They both act aloof & pretend to be carefree , look like young boys, and use the golden staff with several rings held by a circle.

This is the [fella](https://imgur.com/a/rHmPigk) if you haven't already figured out, right below a picture of Shima. 

Right by each other, I realize they look distinctively different. But Goddamn do they act alike!

First of all, I realize the staff could potentially be a separate reference, I remember seeing it throughout several stories but for now I can only remember Hantengu of anger. ( Demon slayer)

After snooping on Sekido (Hantengu of anger), I realize the staff is named khakkhara & carried by Buddhist monks. Putting all of it here just to make sure this is correct, right?

**Now back to the character design, I'm wondering if their personality & looks are inspired by real life references or a random stereotype Story makers like to use?** 

Like white-haired black people, or Tsunderes, or overly angry bullies, etc...

or perhaps some folklore?

If don't put this, I'd feel bad:

Non-cringy anime for a group (late 20s),"My GF and I host movie nights every couple weeks with our friends and we alternate who picks. We recently started including anime. I have a very low tolerance for cringe and tropes, and I'm looking for suggestions for us. We aren't really interested in Shonen or shows that go past the ~25ep mark. 

I personally can't stand the excessive ""fan service"" in a lot of shows, or trope characters such as self insert protagonists, 900 vampire who looks 10, token cute characters, etc... I know that eliminates like 90% of anime, so I've had a hard time finding stuff that sounds interesting.

- Garden of sinners 
- Fate zero
- Rainbow
- Bacanno
- Ghost in the shell + SAC 
- Spice and wolf
- Darker than black
- Jin-Roh
- Violet Evergarden
- A silent voice
- Your name
- Most Gibli movies
- Redline
- Hellsing ultimate

『Kusuriya no Hitorigoto』Mini Anime「Maomao no Hitorigoto」#17,,False,anime,1707165578.0,1ajqx9j,Official Media
"It's funny how the most controversial part of the ""I'm in Love with the Villainess"" anime wasn't a thing in the original light novel."," I quite enjoyed the first season of ""I'm in Love with the Villainess"" so I decided to start reading through the light novel series that the anime is based on. I'm only up through the second volume right now but the anime covered only the first volume and an eighth of the second, so I've already read through more than everything that was in the anime and so feel comfortable making this post.

A small bit of controversy the anime had was a part of it where people felt the series was comparing homosexuality and incestuous relationships as equivalent, albeit in a positive way.

Quick summary, the main character, Rae Taylor, is an open lesbian in love with Claire François. Someone within their school is orchestrating a series of events with the intention of fanning the flames of class resentment and even goes so far as to unleash a chimera within the school in order to slaughter the aristocrats. Rae confronts the culprit, who turns out to be Lambert, the brother of Claire's maid Lene. Why is he doing all of this? He's being blackmailed by a mysterious man in a mask who will have Lene killed if Lambert doesn't do as he says. Lambert tries to feign like just threatening the life of his sister wouldn't be enough to get him to betray his family and the kingdom, especially when his family directly benefits from supporting the kingdom and having it prosper. Rae then hits him and us with the twist that Lambert and Lene's relationship is not strictly one of brother and sister. The two are involved in an incestuous relationship with each other.

And here's where the main bit of controversy comes in. In the original Japanese, Rae says the line “Homosexual love is not the only one to be taboo.” to further confirm to Lambert, and then soon Lene who has been listening in on the scene, that she knows what they've been doing.

This was less controversial with the English dub, where Rae instead says the line ""They call homosexuality the forbidden love, meanwhile you're in a relationship with your sibling-"", with Rae's VA (who is great, by the way, I love how much of a little friggin' gremlin she makes Rae in a lot of scenes) delivering it in a less than sympathetic manner. But obviously that doesn't change what the original line was.

...Nor does that line in the anime change what the line, or lack there of, was in the original source material, that being the light novel.

Yeah, there is no line like that from Rae at any point in the book where this arc happens or even in the next book when they mention and reflect on the events of the first.

Benefit of the doubt, I think the reason the anime added a line like that, beyond trying to establish a thematic parallel between the protagonist and one of the antagonists, is because the LNs are told from Rae's first person perspective (Konosuba does the same with Kazuma, if I recall correctly). It's Rae's narration that clarifies that Lamert and Lene are in an incestuous relationship, something that isn't nearly as present in the anime, and thus the people making the anime may have felt that leaving things as just what the dialogue in the book was might have been too vague for the audience to understand what the implication was.

Here's that section in the book (page 224 for anyone who wants to see the full context and make sure I'm not taking things *out* of context):

>""My sister is certainly important to me. But do you really think I would endanger the rest of my family for only her?""  
>  
>""If she were only your sister.""  
>  
>This time Lambert's eyes widened. He couldn't have imagined I knew what I'd just implied.  
>  
>""How much do you...""  
>  
>""I told you, everything.""  
>  
>Lambert was in love with Lene - not as a sister, but as a woman. In order to save her, he had no choice but to do as the people holding her hostage directed, even if it meant putting their family's livelihood in danger.

Unlike this scene in the anime, and same for the rest of it, at no point does Rae or the story draw any kind of parallel between familial incest and homosexuality, or even between specifically Lamert and Lene's forbidden love and Rae's love for Claire that she believes will never be reciprocated.

Don't get me wrong, the books don't exactly condemn the relationship either and from what I've read ahead on the two do eventually come back (in very minor support roles), but all the sympathy Rae and Claire show is specifically through the context of how much they care about Lene. This includes the end of the arc when Lambert and Lene are sent into exile (they were originally going to be executed for treason but Rae and Claire managed to get the king to give them a reduced sentence in light of them being blackmailed and their family's long service to the kingdom). In the anime, when Rae is comforting Claire, she talks about how unfair the world can be, how ""We can't even love the one we want to"". And like before, there is no such line in the book. The focus is entirely on Rae comforting Claire, who despite all that had happened didn't want Lene, one of her oldest and closest friends, to leave and how sad it was that things don't always turn out the way people want. They are sympathetic to Lene, they don't judge or condemn her for being in a relationship with her sibling, they give her what they can to have a chance at a happy life wherever she'll end up, but it's all specifically because it's Lene, not because of however they feel about incestuous relationships. In fact in vol. 2 when a noble is craptalking the two traitors and their disgusting relationship, Rae's pissed off defense of them is only in regards to how they were blackmailed into committing treason. She doesn't comment at all on the relationship.

This isn't the worst change I've seen an anime do in an LN adaptation. Rising of the Shield Hero for example will always stand out to me because of how the anime for some bizarre reason decided to make Raphtalia not know what sex was and think that kissing was what made people pregnant. They basically made her weirdly innocent and childish when it came to sex, which made any potential future romance with Naofumi way creepier and with more of a power balance than it was already at risk of being because of the age difference and her initially being his slave, and naturally this was something that caused controversy because yeah, why the fuck wouldn't it?! Meanwhile, LN Raphtalia was well aware of what sex was (the village she grew up in even bred livestock for farming, so she knew how babies were made) and in fact the scenes where the anime had her being clueless and red-faced over the idea of Naofumi kissing her and making her pregnant, in the LN they're about Raphtalia reflecting on the fact that Naofumi is currently incapable of seeing her in any sort of sexual way because of how understandably traumatized he still is over being framed for sexual assault by someone he had trusted and been attracted to. You know, stuff that actually has her have some level of maturity and awareness.

While Lambert and Lene's relationship is nowhere near as relevant to ""I'm in Love with the Villainess"" as Raphtalia and Naofumi's is to ""Rising of the Shield Hero"", like the change to Raphtalia's character it is kind of weird that the anime would give Rae such lines that add a problematic element that wasn't originally there. Yeah, the incestuous relationship between these two side characters was there in the books but there was never any equivalence or parallel made between incest and homosexuality. It was part of the story but it wasn't made part of the story's themes.",False,anime,1707105069.0,1aj78bh,Discussion
Recommend me anime like this," 

I recently watched **Konosuba**, **The Dungeon of Black Company** and **Combatants will be dispatched**, and I simply loved these animes, so I would like you to recommend animes in this style.

I'm not exactly looking for Isekais, I just want comedy animes that are in that style, characters making funny faces, unusual and funny scenes and most importantly, what all three of these animes I mentioned have in common is a **morally questionable protagonist**.

Middle School Anime Club Suggestions,"Hello! 

I am a history teacher, but I have the opportunity to teach a middle school anime class (7-9th grade). This is my second year teaching anime and I find the best way to enjoy an anime is to watch a series of pilots before we all vote on their favorites. Here are my stipulations: 

1. Anime must be short(1 Season, 12-24 episodes)
2. Anime must be clean(7th graders exist)
3. Must have a Dub(Too many reading levels for Sub)

Animes/Pilots we have watched so far this Semester:

Promised Neverland(Just season 1), Spy x Family, Karuko's Basketball, Assassination Classroom, Sword Art Online(Just season 1),

"i cant find my childhood anime anywhere, please help","edit: i found it! thanks guys <3

i used to watch tiji and teletoon all the time as a kid and lots of anime dubbed to french aired on it. there's a magical girl anime on it that took away my breathe but i CANT FIND IT :(

here's what i remember of it (spoiler duh):
main protagonist (pink. idk if her hair is too but she's pink lol) can travel to a different magic world with the help of some pet???? by the time she's back, time on earth has passed by only a second.
in the different world the ¿queen? is ¿dead? so there's a school for the magic wielders  to learn about it, and at the end there's some sort of competition and the winner earns some very powerful thingy and becomes ruler??????

there's a purple genius girl, and a blonde rich bestie, a short snubby dude who's mom is never home (random fact to remember)

the protagonist has a crush on her earth classmate, BUT in the magic world there's an antagonist who looks JUST like him, turns out to be his twin sister and they're BOTH the queen's children. 

final thing i remember, in the competition 2 contestants from 2 different schools were asked to make a dress??? so the blonde rich girl makes one inspired from a droplet on water, made out of water.

it's not madoka magika, little witch academy, precure. it's probs before 2011 but not old enough to look 90's style.

A very specific isekai suggestions request,"Hi there! This community was really kind and helped me a lot last time I needed some suggestions, so I figured I’d ask for your support again.

The point is I’m really struggling to like the isekai genre and I’ve so far dropped all the isekai anime I’ve tried to give a chance to. It’s obviously not about the lack of quality or good writing, it’s just that I’ve always been naturally adverse to stories set in the past and centred around magic and/or fantasy.

Hence, what I wanted to ask is: are there any good isekai you can suggest that have the protagonist reincarnate in the present or even in the future? Also it would be a huge plus if the characters used some other kind of superpower instead of magic spells and taming mystical creatures (or if they were “normal” people with no powers too!).

Why You Should Watch Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom,"I know, the title sounds like it's straight out of an emo teenager's diary, but don't let that discourage you from giving this amazing anime a shot! If you are interested in a more serious story with a great cast of characters or something a little different than most of the action anime that comes out nowadays and want to watch something a little darker then I highly recommend you give it a try!

&#x200B;

**Synopsis from** [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5682/Phantom__Requiem_for_the_Phantom)

Mafia is rife in America where assassinations are a regular occurrence on the streets. Inferno, a mysterious company, is behind most of these dealings through the use of their near-invincible human weapon, ""Phantom.""

One day, a Japanese tourist accidentally witnesses Phantom's latest murder. Desperate to escape, the tourist hides in a secluded building. However, Phantom, revealed to be a young woman named Ein, and the leader of Inferno ""Scythe Master"" captures the tourist and brainwashes him.

Given the name ""Zwei,"" this once peaceful tourist is now a puppet of Inferno with no memories. Drawn into a world of lies, deceit, and violence, Zwei must fight to survive, hopefully to one day regain his memories and escape from this world where he is constantly on the brink of death.

&#x200B;

**Production Values**

Despite being released in 2009, the animation still holds up surprisingly well. The action sequences are well-animated, and the overall visuals are pleasant to look at. Sure, the art style might seem a bit bland, but the background art is detailed and immersing enough to cover that up. The music is also a great thing about the series, some of the OSTs are also very experimental and unique! Here is the best OST from the series called  ""[Canzone of Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0cR-E0oxn4)""

For example, I remember how much US audiences and reviewers tried to ignore or admitted to hate Police in a Pod because it showed the cops in a normal light while high profile cases of police brutality are/still are happening in the US. Another more specific example is that some audiences don't like how varying the personalities, reasonings and outcome of abusers in MHA are instead of just all of them being straight up monsters that deserved to get arrested or killed like most media tend to portray them due to their own experiences.",False,anime,1707146865.0,1ajj4rf,Discussion

Characters you don't like but whose hate is overblown/out of proportion,"Has there ever been a character you dislike but whose hate you feel like it's out of proportion, especially when it's to the point of wishing physical harm to them just for existing?

This one is no more apparent than Kazuya kinoshita from rent a girlfriend. Say what you will about him since most of the criticism i agree with, like his character constantly regressing which is mostly on reiji letting the shit drag out, but either way Kazuya is good example because half the time it feels like people are only hating on him because it's the popular thing to do before they find a next target and i never see them do it with the other cast members since they're not much better because they, like Kazuya do shitty things including but not limited to sexual assault. cough ruka cough.

As for me, i gave up reading it because of kazuya's family not giving a shit they were lied to for 2 straight years and chizuru, whose just as responsible for letting it go on ran away and only had kazuya do the talking. I gave up afterwards cause it wasn't worth getting mad at.

Also whats with the comparing him to characters like ayanokoji from classroom of the elite? I don't know, it's weird because they're two completely different characters and genres and ayanokoji is a sociopath despite him being one of my favorites. I get the chad characters comparison, but characters like ayanokoji are chad because of the context of their stories and a chad wouldn't fit the kind of story rent a girlfriend is.

One more thing that annoys me the most from the hate is how people always feel the need to keep bringing him up in things unrelated to him or romance in anything anime. Idk because most of it feels forced and are only there for upvotes and karma farming. I never subscribe to the idea of ""if you hate Kazuya, you're just like him"" because it's nonsensical and there's reasons to not like him, like his chizuru obsession, but nobody helps their case by getting that angry at a fictional character.

what takes Hulu so long to get the dubbing for anime?,"i pretty much only watch anime in dub (only exception being the weekly releases of attack on titan and mushoku tensei). i used to only watch anime on Hulu, because that was the only streaming service i ever had

i would notice that for some shows, despite knowing it had a dub, would only have sub episodes. which confused me, especially for shows who’s dub had been out for a while. even now, my hero academia season 6 has been out for a long time, and hulu still doesn’t have all the episodes dubbed (i think), but other platforms do

is there a reason for this? i guess this question applies to other streaming services as well. on netflix, devil is a part timer didn’t get its dub for the longest time, despite the dub being out for a while (iirc)",False,anime,1707144499.0,1aji8a0,Discussion
Anime where the protagonist was the driver of the show.,"I just read a post asking for the least interesting protagonists, so I got curious which anime protagonists you felt drove the show. These characters put the ""pro"" in protagonist, not because they're competent, but because they DO feel like the center of the story. Not in the isekai powerfantasy sense, but who they are as people, how they push the plot and or even how they react to the things unfolding. They feel part of the story rather than just there as a guide for the audience. They scream ""now this is how you do a protagonist!"" 

They don't have to be brilliantly written (but that's ofc a plus), so long as you can feel they're the protagonist in a good way. Not in a plot armour sense. 

Some examples I can think of are Natsuki Subaru (Re:Zero), Rudeus Greyrat (Mushoku Tensei), Emiya Shirou (Fate/Stay Night), Mao Mao (Apothecary Diaries), Honda Tohru (Fruits Basket). These are some of the protagonists that I feel are feel engrained within the story and has a presence and leaves an impression. They're not boring cardboard cutouts. Even characters like Bocchi (Bocchi the Rock) can fit. I have more, but I want to hear you guys share too!

Ah, I'd be really cool if you can share why you feel they exemplify a great protagonist even if unorthodox. You can put someone like Makoto from School days if you like!.. Do people think he's a good protagonist? Genuinely curious.

Edit: I realize I put Rudeus Greyrat here subconsciously. Welp, can't help it. Whether you love or hate him, the story definitely does use him as a way to tell the story and he feels like a part of the world. ",False,anime,1707144472.0,1aji7x0,Discussion
Was Isekai started in Japan?,"So, I’m a huge fan of Isekai anime. I know it gets heavily watered down because of the ongoing bandwagon trend to jump on whatever is popular and release hundreds of animes around that style. I’m not really looking to discuss that. 

But, I was thinking about it. I mean the term Isekai is fairly new, but I think the idea of regular people being transported to a fantasy world is obviously not. Specifically I’m thinking back to the old Dungeons and Dragons cartoon of the 80s. Which then sparks the question, was the idea of this actually born in the western world? I’m not as familiar with Manga, particularly old manga and wondering if there’s some that would have the same type of story but predate this cartoon? 

(Side note: I know Alice in Wonderland and the Wizard of OZ maybe be considered these too, but I was more thinking along the lines of a person being transported to a fantasy world where they are then caught up in a hero’s quest with RPG or D&D-style stats.)",False,anime,1707144354.0,1aji6d7,Discussion

These days every season is so stacked with anime.,"I wonder if there were seasoned anime watchers out there like me. There are just so many shows to watch. I thought new season would be better but every season is like previous season.

I have been reading manga/ LN and watching anime for a long time. Every season it's like this:

# 1.Several manga/LN that I once read before got anime adaptations.

For example, in last season there are: Frieren, Dark Gathering. 

In this season: Still Frieren, The witch and the beast, Instant Death, Unwanted Adventurer, The Foolish Angel Dances with the Devil, 'Tis Time for ""Torture"" Princess.

# 2.Several anime with interesting premises.

This season: Sasaki and Peeps

# 3.Several rumored good manga that got anime adaptation .

last season, for example: The Apothecary Diaries.

This season: Dungeon Meshi

# 4.Next season I the anime I have watched.

For example, in last season there are: Spy x Family SS2, Eminence in Shadow ss2, Dr Stone New world part 2, Ragna Crimson part 2, DMDP part 2, JJK ss2. 

In this season: COTE ss3, Tsukimichi ss2, Blue Exorcist ss3, Bottom-Tier Tomozaki ss2

4 types of anime stacking up lead to me following at least 5 different anime of the season.

You know you won't stop because you love watching anime. If you stopped, the anime would stack up to next season and you would want to watch it anyway cuz you still kinda enjoy it. I could drop 3-4 shows, but in the end there are still many enjoyable ones.

Where did all these number from the video on Youtube come from?," So according to this video on Youtube, ""soLo leVeLiNg BROkE The InteRneT"", but I have seen so little talk about it. The talk about it is almost non-existent in random subreddits. Random clips on Youtube are not even high views like anime below it like Frieren and JJK2. Nothing notable about meme section either. In fact, these past few months, the Lobotomy Kaisen just spreads everywhere like wildfire because fans went crazy and Frieren has Elf Feet + Cloth Melting Potion memes.

I saw Solo Leveling karma on this sub does not come even close to ""breaking internet"" and on MAL it's like 73k scorers with 400k members, while anime below Solo leveling like Frieren has 160k scorers with 500k members and JJK 2 with 370k scorers+ 820k members

Just where did this number come from?

"If it wasn’t Blue Exorcist, what was it?","Blue exorcist?

Years ago I watched an anime on Netflix and really enjoyed it. It was about a high school aged boy who worked as an exorcist and had blue flames from his hands and sword. I could’ve sworn I watched and enjoyed Blue Exorcist. 

With the new season coming out, I went to rewatch it and it’s a whole different story. Completely. 

The one from years ago started with a girl traveling to school on a train and she sees a fight in the forest with a boy who takes on several bad guys or thugs in a fury of blue flame. She is in awe and then finds that same boy goes to her school, and wears gloves all the time. He is also absent a lot because of whatever work he does. She finds out his truth and tries to help him keep his secret identity.  There are other characters that are familiar to what’s on now like his brother and someone like Angel but they don’t go to school with him he only meets up with them when he goes to help in exorcist situations.

Campfire cooking in another world with my absurd skill for a non anime viewer,"Hello!

For a bit of context, the only anime I've been able to consistently watch was Inuyasha, the rest I dropped because I wasn't enjoying them. If anything I'm more of a manga reader although recently I've only kept up with Dungeon Meshi and finished Umineko no naku koro ni.

I decided to give Campfire cooking a go as I like fantasy monsters and I like cooking. Let me preface this by saying I really enjoyed the different creatures and the dishes made with them looked delicious, and the show was overall enjoyable. However I don't understand...the point? 

Please don't come at me before I explain. I suppose there is animes where everything goes well and you ad a viewer are just witnessing a happy calm life but it felt weirdly empty in the sense of the main character doesn't experience any conflict during the whole show. He has a familiar that is able to destroy everything real quick, he has a barrier that shields him from everything, and he makes a crazy amount of money. When they present you with a new creature Fel just destroys it. To me the story didn't feel compelling at all (as there was no story), like, does he not want to go back to his world? How is he not surprised to be summoned? Plus no characters actually stick long enough to care.

I still did like to a degree the cooking but that was about it and I'd like to understand why this anime has such high praise (not coming for anyone that likes it, it's just that obviously not being much in this world I'm not too sure of what's expected of the genre)

And also: is there any other anime with a similar theme that has a more compelling story ir at least that has the MC overcome some hurdles? Don't recommend Dungeon Meshi as I'm up to date with the manga please 🙏

Looking for an anime,"I am looking for an anime I watched that is nowhere online 

I know I can’t remember much information but it’s because I watched it around 8 years ago but here’s what I can tell you:


The first thing was that the main girl was at a party with a man who I believe she liked and there was a bowl of punch and another bowl with spiked punch 
She drank the spiked one and passed out, the man brought her inside and as she rested then she woke up and continued conversing with him 
The only other scene we know of was a scene with her and a handful of friends under a lamppost

I’m pretty sure it was on Netflix as that was my only means of watching anime at that time 

It also had no fantasy elements to my knowledge

What animes in your opinion are overrated and why?,"Devilman Crybaby - Used shock value to draw people in and then was devoid of emotion during what should've been emotional scenes imo

Bocchi the Rock - Portrays anxiety as some crippling disease where you are not able to function at all. Anxiety in reality is a before and after thought primarily, however it can also be a strong “during” thought (class presentation comes to mind). Going to a meet up becomes 100x more stressful because you are contemplating completely irrelevant things from 100 different angles because anxiety. So many people were saying ""literally me."" I have powerful anxiety and I know it is variable depending on the person, but the Bocchi portrayal is not even semi realistic, even in the worst cases.

Frieren - I am a week to week watcher and think its fantastic, but the writing up to this point does not put it at an S tier level. It's rated higher than FMA:BH on MAL when the writing by ep 20 in FMA is worlds better and introduces much more creativity/world building/depth/plot. So far frieren is ""old elf that looks young has a strong love for magic, enjoys traveling with her party, and is trying to gain more spells. Also enjoys her companions company.""

JJK - Plot development < Fight with good animation. Don't really need to elaborate on this. Over half of S2 was dedicated to flashy fights with hardly any dialogue. A mix of both is necessity.

I’m trying to find one of the first anime’s I watched on Netflix,I don’t remember much but it was about this three kids that were in a orphanage or something like that. The girl of the group got taken and then only two boys were left. Then one of the kids punches a wall or something to save himself and the other kid and someone watches them. Then the main character is taken to be a knight or some shit and finds his old childhood friend(the girl) but she’s like a god or something. He becomes a knight to protect her and shit but then they find out that their other childhood friend is evil. I think he was being controlled and they try to save him. That’s about as much as I remember. I think there was a lot of things about like gods and I remember that the main character had a connection to a Pegasus or something. Also the main character that went evil had a scene with the other male character in which they were on top of a hill and they drew something. I think it also had to do with this bracelets that the girl main character made for them. I think the main character that was a knight had a crush on the girl and the other male main character or at least it seemed like it. I watched it like what 5-6 years ago on netflix when I was a kid so I don’t remember much. If anyone know the name please tell me. Sorry for the long paragrap.,False,anime,1707102292.0,1aj6d5v,Help

Cowboy Bebop - Anime of the Week,"Welcome to the weekly Anime of the Week Discussion Thread! Each week, we're here to discuss various older anime series. Today we are discussing...

## Cowboy Bebop

Crime is timeless. By the year 2071, humanity has expanded across the galaxy, filling the surface of other planets with settlements like those on Earth. These new societies are plagued by murder, drug use, and theft, and intergalactic outlaws are hunted by a growing number of tough bounty hunters.

Spike Spiegel and Jet Black pursue criminals throughout space to make a humble living. Beneath his goofy and aloof demeanor, Spike is haunted by the weight of his violent past. Meanwhile, Jet manages his own troubled memories while taking care of Spike and the Bebop, their ship. The duo is joined by the beautiful con artist Faye Valentine, odd child Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV, and Ein, a bioengineered Welsh Corgi.

While developing bonds and working to catch a colorful cast of criminals, the Bebop crew's lives are disrupted by a menace from Spike's past. As a rival's maniacal plot continues to unravel, Spike must choose between life with his newfound family or revenge for his old wounds.

***Gunpla is Freedom!***

**Questions of the Day:**

1) Now that we've seen all that the Gundam Build shows have to offer (other than Metaverse, which you can watch on your own), which *one* character is your favorite? How about your least-favorite?

2) Which entry is responsible for giving you the most of your favorite songs from all of these shows?

3) How do you rank each of the shows that we watched for this rewatch? If you've seen other Gundam shows, where do these rank amongst your favorites?

4) If you were in charge of making your own Gundam Build series, what would you have it be about, and what sort of Gunpla would you have the characters use?

5) What do you do at the end of the rewatch? Are you busy? Will you save me?

Why is Frieren so good and enjoyable ?,"Frieren has been one of my favourite anime to come out in the 2020s but I just don't know why ? Besides the animation, music and some characters everything else feels average and even generic, especially the fantasy world, but it's still so good, I sit there after the episode trying to understand why did I enjoy it, I don't know how to explain it, they made a whole episode about Fern being ill and it was still so good, I don't know how or why but I can't complain.",False,anime,1707087461.0,1aj177o,Discussion

How important are Opening and Ending songs for your impression of an anime?,"As stated above, how do the songs chosen for particular anime, or an episode cour have an effect on your enjoyment, memory, or overall perception of it?

For me, I have noticed that if there is a good song attached to it, my attention is grabbed more easily, since I look forward to it and puts me in a good mood (especially important for me to follow weekly releases). Some personal and recent examples for this are Undead Unluck S1 op, Apothecary Diaries S1 op, Frieren S1 and S2 op and ed, and Jujutsu Kaisen Hidden Inventory Arc op.

On the other side, there are openings, like the Domestic Kanojo one, that I love, but can't seem to be enough to persuade me into liking the anime as a whole.
Others are songs like Blue Aoi, or the Durarara S1 opening, that instantly make me travel in time back to when I first watched them.

Edit: Thanks for all the replies! From what I've recollected the consensus is, for the most part, that it really does matter as an adjacent of the show, but not really being too influential in the enjoyment of it, however it can become an emotional hook for watchers after a long time. Sorry for the late replies! This has been some great insight and I'm excited to listen to the op/eds you've recommended!

Heya im looking for a specific anime that i saw in an insta reel and sadly i couldnt find the reel anymore,"so in the clip the MC i assume? is confronted by a group of priests or guards im not sure who say he will be judged or something and then the main priest/guard  uses a gravity spell and forces the MC and his group to the ground.   then you can see the MC slowly standing up and the evil dude says something like ""not even a swordmaster like you can escape this gravity field""

&#x200B;

then the MC says ""im not a swordsmaster, i just wield the sword cause it looks cool""  and then he uses ""magic reversal"" and the gravity field switches to the evil dudes side and pulls all of them down

Animes similar to A Sign of Affection • Yubisaki to Renren,"does anyone know any animes similar to a sign of affection? there's only 5 eps out right not and it kinda sucks waiting bc i'm really enjoying it and i wish i could just binge it.

i'm trying to find an anime with these sort of similarities to it:

\- set in college

\- really nice animation style

\- mature characters who make the plot happen, the plot does not happen to them

\- things move fast ish b/c no petty drama / lies / childish stuff like that

\- easy & cute watch but still a little serious

\- honesty between the mc's

\- ok this one is something i just liked about the anime but they had a little costco scene/reference and it was so cute and i've never really seen anything like that in other animes

Is there an anime for me?,"I grew up watching Naruto, Dragon ball, Bleach and also watched some others along the way such as Katekyo Hitman Reborn, Fairy tail, One Piece. However some time has passed and I wanted to comeback and watch I haven't yet explored. I very much enjoyed Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I also tried Hunter x Hunter, Attack on Titan, Black Clover and Demon Slayer which were recommended to me. The issue that I have, and I may not have this problem when I was younger, how stupid the characters are. They are almost  caricature. Main character that's an oaf, likes to eat, has no boundaries, is a loveable idiot, and wants to get stronger amongst many traits. I feel like most of the stuff is just recycled characters with different setting.    


Another thing - I get that anime is Japanese but some things are just to annyoing. Like the Zenitsu character from Demon Slayer. Or that characters seem to be ok with death, killing. There is always a 180IQ genius 12 year old that's been training martial arts he's been 3, because his parents abandoned him. It is a school / university but still ""kids"" are either taking things to seriously, are too violent... it just doesn't feel right for me. There's always a 'baka' girl, people beating up eachother for no reason. Hero has no life - only a goal to get stronger. This is abuse, not a training. You don't get good by practicing for 16h a day, running 10km and doing 100 push-ups. You make a mistake? Your mentor takes away your food etc.  


Another thing - that's a shonen thing nowadays but annoys me so much... Why does everyone have to have a special power? Like in first 2 Jojo chapters it was kind of cool but since the 3rd one each episode was basically scooby-doo'ing enemy stando. That's like the whole premise of Hunter x Hunter, Jojo, One Piece, later Naruto, later Bleach and the list goes on.   


So overall Attack on Titan was cool, although a bit too dark for me. Fullmetal alchemist was splendid. First two seasons of Jojo - great! I remember fondly Naruto but that might be nostalgia speaking. I think that I might be into Shonen but cannot tell.   


tldr; how do I find something that I may like?

Animes to watch outside of popular things?,"I watched many of popular things like Mukoshu tensei, TenSura and so on, and have taste for power fantasy titles with OP MCs with little to no shortcomings. 

I have strong aversion for situations where writer wants to show ""weak humane characters"", ""fragile identities"", ""rough life"" and ""deep thoughts"". I'd rather look at ""bad, cliched and fan service"" title than ""award winning masterpiece""

The reason is i use anime to escape real life, not experience it. And ""deep thoughts"" is usually is not made properly, thus I often have quite rational and logical reasons to disagree with author, and I will never watch anything I strongly disagree with.  As I do ""smart things"" for life i don't even want to bother to figure out if I am agree or not with ""deep thoughts"" (because i was doing that for 8 hours straight 30 mins ago).

"Isekai anime but different, I can’t remember the anime?","So this anime has to deal with a man getting transported into another world, and in the New World, there are so many people who have been transported there that the have created their own Japanese community. 
I only saw one episode and all I can remember is that this anime is different in that the transported person isn’t part of a single group and isn’t the only one of their own. This anime is different in that a bunch of people have been transported to the New World and it’s not anything Unique

Usually isekais have a person who is unique with crazy mad skills and are respected as saviors of the New World. Usually transports are the only ones from Japan in the new world. 

The anime I’m trying to find has a bunch of Japanese ppl getting transported through out time to this new world and the new world isn’t surprised and even created their own Japanese presence in the new world

What does edgy actually mean?,"This is a word I see thrown around a lot in the anime community, usually to describe characters but sometimes an entire anime, and I don’t really get what it means.

Some characters people label as edgy are Guts, Thorfinn, Kaneki, Sasuke, Eren, and I definitely don’t think all these characters are dark in a shallow way.

**QUESTIONS FOR THE SEMI-FINAL OVAs AND THE VERY FINAL MOVIE:**

1. **For those who read chapters 687-698 -** Were the scenes from Manga that have been omitted from Anime important to the overall story, or not at all?
2. Which scene from the Very Final Movie is your favourite?
3. Was the Very Final Movie a satisfying ending of Gintama? If no, what would you change to make the movie better?
4. Also the Very Final Movie received a new artstyle. Did you like the new artstyle for Final Movie, or no?
5. How do you feel about Takasugi’s portrayal during the final Gintoki’s fight with Utsuro? Was it confusing to you? After all, there were a weird shenanigans with Utsuro’s blood taking over the others. - Courtesy of 

**QUESTIONS FOR POST SERIES DISCUSSION** ***FROM YOU FOR YOU!:***

That’s right, you read it correctly! Since one big part of Gintama is about meaningful relationships between Gintoki and his friends, and caring the burden together, I decided to let everyone add a one question that we will answer next week.

So take your time with your answers that you will post next week during the Post Series Discussion on **11th of February.**

# Now to the Questions for post series discussion:

Q1 - What was your favourite aspect of Gintama? Characters? Comedy? All of it?

Q2 - What do you do at the end of the rewatch? Are you busy? Will you save me?

Q3 - Since it took 10 years between the last successful Gintama Rewatch and this one, what is something you'd like to say to either the host or the watchers of the next one in 2034?

Q4A - **FOR FIRST TIMERS** - When did you realize that this show had an over-arching plot developing alongside all the jokes and which episode was ""The one"" that made you go, ""that's it, I'll watch it 'till the end""?

Q4B - **FOR REWATCHERS** - How did it feel watching the series with all the previous knowledge of the plot and watch the characters interactions develop?

Q5 - Without taking in consideration the existence of overarching story of Gintama that existence was a secret revealed in later arcs, how would you expect the Gintama to end if Gintama was only 100% toilet humor/slapstick/gag humour and other aspects of low comedy?

Q6A - How would you murder your rewatch host?

Q6B - What's your favourite shitpost from the show or rewatch?

Q7 - Are there any other rewatches you will be joining?

Q8 - What character did you change your opinion on the most over the course of the series and how?

Q9 - Did any of the many anime references in Gintama made you more interested in watching the referenced show?

Q10 - Gintama has a unique form of storytelling, where there is alot of episodic, unconnected episodes, with the serious arcs sprinkled in between. its not until later where we get more serious arc instead of episodic, comedy and meta episodes. So overall did this format work for you? Did the comedy always land? and was it ever a chore to get through?

Q11 - Did you have a favorite running gag? If so, what was it?

# BUT HERE IS A TWIST!!!

Since you spent a whole year talking to each other, could you actually guess the participant that asked the particular question judging by the question? If you dare, then include your answers in the table below in your comment for the next week!

**Regarding spoilers:**

"What Have You Watched This Past Week That is NOT a Currently Airing Show? [February 4th, 2023]","Title says it all - talk about the anime you watched this past week that are not a part of this Winter 2024 season (like **Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun 2nd Stage** or **Dungeon Meshi**), or a show that's continuing from previous seasons (like **Sousou no Frieren**).

With regards to Fall 2023 shows, however, it would be fine to write about them as long as you only began them after they finished airing. For example, it's fine to talk about watching **The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You** or **Arknights: Perish in Frost** if you started them after the final episode aired. Obviously, use your best judgement on this.

**Please use spoiler tags**; it's super simple stuff. An example below:

        [KonoSuba Ep 9] >!""THIS WAS A VERY BAD EPISODE, DARKNESS DID NOT DESERVE THAT!<

comes out to be [KonoSuba Ep 9] >!""THIS WAS A VERY BAD EPISODE, DARKNESS DID NOT DESERVE THAT!<

Kemono no Souja Erin really hit me,"I watched the 50 episode long series recently after putting it off for many years due to a bias against the older style visuals I saw in episode 1. I have to say I kind of don't regret it because watching it at my current late 20s age really let me get a lot out of it.

The transition of the MC from childhood through major life stages and the constant shift in the groups of people she is around felt very real to me. It reminded me a lot of how people drift around in my actual life and how I shouldnt take it for granted that certain people will just be around.

The world building and politics were shockingly rich as well, it din't feel like those constant cookie cutter settings you see in a lot of isekai fantasy these days. Ryoza legitimately feels like a unique setting with its own customs, culture, animals and vegetation.

The old time aesthetics actually gave me a strong nostalgic vibe as well, it's not overly shiny and bright like modern anime and the characters look a little less attractive. But the world feels so much more real and the fantasy creatures that the MC takes care of as a fantasy world veterinarian come across as especially majestic and otherworldly.

I did have some problems with the pacing and how abruptly the ending was pushed on the audience after dragging the last arc for 5 episodes longer than it should have been, but overall I got to say this was one amazing watch.",False,anime,1707067528.0,1ait5or,Discussion
Watching Kimi no Todoke today feels like watching a parody,"Not because it’s bad or anything! I’ve just seen classic shoujos spoofed so many times in anime from monthly girls nozaki kun, welcome to demon school iruma kun, kaguya-sama, undead unluck, the list goes on. The English dub just came out for the series, and watching it I can tell that Kimi no Todoke is clearly the epitomized example of what they’re parodying, so it’s hard to take the ba-dumps, the dazzling stills of Kazehaya smiling, the manufactured drama, the rival who looks sweet but is evil, the too-pure-for-this-world MC, without feeling like it's all part of some larger punchline. This is coming from a huge shoujo fan, and i can feel the infuences of Kimi no Todoke in some of my faves in the genre such as fruits basket, but no other shoujo feels so much like a parody of the genre as this one does 😅

Where did the Pink-Blue-Yellow magical girl color scheme come from?,"This has been eating away at me for about a year now, but with a new season of Precure upon us and a less family-friendly magical girl show that's making the rounds this season (one could say people are *gushing* over it), I figured I should ask.

If you've never seen a magical girl show before, you've still probably seen these colors. The classic magical girl triplet of the pink lead with her blue and yellow companions shows up anywhere if you want to make a magical girl reference (unless you're *Weathering With You* and want to make a real deep cut). It's synonymous with the genre at this point, but my only remaining question is where did it come from? 

I know pink leads are about as old as color in this genre, and the tried and tested use of the three primary colors for products aimed at kids is probably just as long (see why the original Gundam is colored the way it is), but when this iconic color scheme became the goto for magical girl triads is a little harder to pinpoint. The two biggest works from the 90s era (*Sailor Moon* and *Cardcaptor Sakura*) didn't use it (the latter also only focusing on a singular magical girl) and other similar magical girl( or magical girl-esque) shows from the time like *Magic Knight Rayearth* and *Tokyo Mew Mew* also narrowly avoid the scheme. My next guess would be Precure given that franchise's ubiquity, but Precure arguably didn't adopt the full scheme until 2010 with *Heartcatch Precure* (2009's *Fresh Precure* sort of adopts it, but with a blonde pink lead instead of the ""traditional"" pink hair). However, not even a year after *Heartcatch*, *Madoka Magica* would use the scheme as its pseudo-default magical girl palette, and I doubt 2010 was just teeming with so many *Heartcatch Precure* clones that the scheme became the default. The closest lead I can find is 1999's *Magical Doremi* which featured Pink, Blue, and (Yellow-ish) Orange, but information online about this topic is scarce (or hard to search for) so its hard to lock this one in as the definitive answer.

Admittedly, I'm still rather new to the world of magical girls, so I'm hoping someone with a little more experience with the genre could enlighten me on the matter, or (if there wasn't just one series to attribute it to) how this scheme eventually came to be so dominant...

[I mention Heartcatch Precure, but even that one had a fourth purple Cure added later in the run so...](https://preview.redd.it/iac1ektkjlgc1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff4d1c122ba0e26a26fc337ad17c89fe1fbc43ae)",False,anime,1707064681.0,1ais0iu,Discussion

"You should watch/read ""Undead Unluck"""," So I started reading Undead Unluck a few days ago cause I was too impatient for the anime, and at around 100 chapters now I have to say, it has been an amazing decision. Undead Unluck has one of the most interesting plots involving characters with superpowers.

The art is amazing, the characters are fun, the fights are great and the story is exciting, The world-building is detailed and one-of-a-kind. The whole manga reminds me of why I like unique power systems and characters who use those powers in creative ways. The story never loses its pacing and always has a way of engaging you, that is also one of the reasons why JoJo's is one of my favorite manga of all time. The parts of the story that concern the whole world also remind me of the world-ending events in Jojo's, so if you love JoJos, Chainsaw Man or JuJutsu Kaisen, you will also love Undead Unluck

So I'm kinda disappointed that the anime isn't able to gain as much traction as other big shows because this show does deserve to be bigger. So if you haven't watched/read Undead Unluck, you should give it a try, It's a great action-adventure-comedy story, It's story about the quest to find the greatest death possible.",False,anime,1707054942.0,1aiof17,Discussion

Anime & characters with mental health symptoms?,"Hello Everyone! 
I'm doing a research project on mental health portrayed in anime. 

While I know in Japanese Culture (along with most minority cultures) talking about mental health is little to nonexistent. 

I am hoping that this research project will help reach a new set of audience. 

If you know any animes that have a theme of a mental health condition or character that shows traits of a mental health condition, I would love to see what comes up.

**2. Madoka magica** – same studio as the previous one so the animation is geart, really amazing story, it's very unique take.

March comes in like a lion was great but…,"Shogi still seems kind of boring. Whenever they were playing shogi with a few exceptions i was generally kind of bored.

Of course if i knew how to play shogi maybe that would change a bit. I know its supposed to show Rei growing and changing as a person but i like the show more when it focused on the sisters and the side characters interacting with him. As well as the sisters story in season 2.

I know ppl love this show so my rating at least for the first season will probably receive some backlash. I go by mal scores so a 7/10 is good, a 9/10 is great.

Season 1: 7/10 
Season 2: 9/10

I almost dropped the show towards the middle/end of the show around episode 16 for season 1 but hearing how great season 2 was made me push through it a bit more. Im glad i did because season 2 was great but i think if i hadnt already been well acquainted with slower anime i probably wouldve dropped it. 

The first half of season 1 was pretty good but the middle got boring, idr much of the end of season 1. Im trying to keep this spoiler free for the most part so my answers are kind of vague. I put season 1 on hold for a couple months around episode 16 tho so my memory of season 1 is kind of vague. Started season 1 like 6 months ago, started season 2 like a month ago.

Tldr: The sisters were great I dont think there was a part of the show I disliked when they were there, His past and his stepsister were interesting, The teacher and the fat kid shogi player were cool, the shogi was done pretty well but my attention span is trash so it was mostly boring to me.

 Overall i recommend it, not as a first anime but if u have watched a decent amount like 20-30 that aren’t just action animes u would probably enjoy it. Hope they make a season 3 eventually.",False,anime,1707051890.0,1aingb0,Discussion

Violet Evergarden is a masterpiece,"I just finished watching the 13 episodes of the main anime and am blown away by how beautiful and emotional this anime was. I am ashamed that I originally wrote this anime off when it initially aired after only watching one episode. Finally years later I decided to give it another chance because I've seen it mentioned positively several times on this sub.

The story telling, setting, animation, characters, and music are all so beautiful. This anime starts off slow but by the second half, each episode is full of emotions and makes you really feel sad for Violet and the people she encounters. I haven't cared about a protagonist this much in a long long time. I love how Violet was written from being an emotionless killing machine to a very sweet and emotional woman who wants to find the most important person in her life and find closure.

I highly recommend this anime for anyone who wants a change of pace and to experience an truly beautiful story. I plan on watching the 2 movies next after this and if anyone knows of similar animes, please recommend them.

Cyberpunk Edgerunner : 4 Stars, was the one which got me into anime.

Death Note: 4.5 stars

Monster: 4.5 stars

One Piece (Have taken a break during Dressrosa, to much filler) : 4 stars

Jujutsu Kaisen: 4 stars (struggled with season 1, loved season 2)

Attack on Titan; 5 stars, some of the best writing I’ve seen, not only in anime. And think the ending was perfect.

Neo Genesis: 3.5 stars

Chainsaw man: 4 stars

Demon Slayer: 3 stars, only finished first season/arc and not really interested in continuing anytime soon.

What are your thoughts on the production committee system? Are there any other successful alternatives to producing an anime?,"A main advantage of the production committee system is that it enables various companies to minimize the risk of producing and financing an anime. 

A main disadvantage is that even if the anime does well, the profits are to be split; not evenly depending on who financed more into the production. 

___

But these are points as it relates to the sponsors. What about as it relates to the contractors and subcontractors - i.e the animation studios?

For example, in this [Animator Dormitory video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=O2yLGjCz_JM), Ryoko stresses the root of the anime industry wage crisis is due to the production committee system. She claims the system “structurally keeps production costs low” and references to this [video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZUwlwQj40VI&t=0s) as to why. 

A few points made in this other video are:

* production committees do not give enough budget to the animation studios.

* production committees do not “allow animators to benefit from the royalties” after the studio(s) contract are done. I think this especially applies to committees where the animation studio is not on the committee.

* to the above point, royalties would really only be given to “Directors, scenario writers, and similar roles” and not to the majority of the animators.

* If one company wants to raise the animation budget for the animation studio, all other companies would have to be on board.

They claim optimizing workflows with digital technologies or AI would help both animation studios and the committee; at the same time, I just feel like that makes production committees try to expect the anime to be made faster and cheaper and to justify a lower budget in the future. 

Especially when you look at Kadokawa’s quarterly reports and how they want to increase the number of anime they produce every year, I can’t help but think animation studios will suffer more.

At the same time, just how much can production companies finance? Would they be able to turn a profit if they increased the anime budget by 3x  to account for animator pay - as in the $ / cut animators earn is 3x more? 

We envision these companies to be greedy, but can they actually give a manageable budget in the first place? Even with the production committee system which is designed to minimize risk, it seems profits still do not turn out all that well all the time.

The scene was almost completely black with a scary cat-like or demon face. I think it was a fight and I think the characters were mostly all red or maybe even just outlines. It was sort of trippy and used a lot of perspective shots where the characters face was closer to the camera.

"Girls of r/anime, what are some actually well-written female characters?","*Everyone’s allowed to chime in with their opinions, but I mainly care about what the girlies think. 

Recently I’ve been thinking a lot about how I struggle to name more than a handful of well-written female characters in anime. So I tried to look up articles and other subreddits but it was obvious that most of these opinions belonged to men. Of course I’m not saying men can’t have an opinion on this, but I’m more interested in hearing other women’s opinion. If I’m being honest, it’s not only disappointing but also somewhat alarming to see the female characters that some (but often many) men deem well written, as they’re usually not. 

Personally, I think that Jolyne from JoJo’s part 6 is one of the best female characters in anime, but I also really like Maka (Soul Eater), Morgiana (Magi), Asa (Chainsaw Man) and all the Studio Ghibli girls of course. I’m also currently watching Nana and I absolutely love the female characters. 

I would love to hear everyone’s opinion and hopefully get some inspiration on new anime as I’m dying too see some good female representation.

*EDIT: I should have specified that I don’t usually watch romance/ slice of life anime. I’m aware that there are many great female characters in these anime genres that cater specifically to women. I guess my issues is that in most anime that don’t solely cater to women, well written female characters are far and few between (e.g. main stream anime, seinen, action/ adventure, psychological, thriller etc) 

**EDIT: I’m very sorry if I ever came off as rude when replying to anyone. I’m really happy that so many people have engaged with my post and I love to hear people’s different opinions and perspectives.

Bocchi the review...by me.,"I've always been into music anime since watching love live. Hearing the sounds and lyrics from a different part of the world is always fun. Not to mention seeing really cool people come together and make magic happen. That's what I saw while watching bocchi the rock. An anime that took the community by storm and is still popular to this day. It has style, comedy, interesting characters and most of all cool music. The story starts with the titular character bocchi gotoh trying to make friends. But unfortunately for her, finding popularity as an introvert is pretty hard. 

She can't talk to anyone without freaking out. And would literally turn to ash before being that extroverted party animal. But thankfully for her; she picks up a guitar as a way to express herself. After years and years of practice (due to her having nothing else to do) she becomes a virtuoso. So much so that she starts her own YouTube channel and racks up a hefty subscriber count. But unfortunately, loneliness still pulls at her no matter what she does to cope. So one day in an attempt to make some friends, she brings her guitar to school. Hoping that someone will find it interesting and talk to her. 

Sadly she doesn't get any bites, until she meets a blonde girl named nijika ijichi. Who begs her to join her group after a fallout with another guitar player. Bocchi tags along, fighting off a mental meltdown along the way. It's then that she's introduced to the world of Rock n roll through various clubs and eccentric people. Not just that, but we get to see her start what comes to be known as kesoku band. The world of bocchi is what really brought this show to life for me. As everyone is so colorful and filled with a unique swagger that makes them stand out.

Take nijikas older sister Seika for an example. She's the cool and collected owner of a club called starry. A hole in the wall locale where underground bands play for their audiences. It's here she puts bocchi and her friends to work. Letting them earn money to rent out venues while at the same time learning by watching different bands. You gotta love a tsundere type character who is hard on the outside. But on the inside she just wants this young group of rockers to be ready. Between that and her always taking care of her little sister, it's no wonder why she's a personal fave. 

One that I don't care for is Ryo, the blue haired bassist of kesoku band. She comes off as a quiet and more reserved type, but that's just a cover up. She's really a bumming leech that wants to take advantage of all her friends. I mean seriously, she tries to take from poor bocchi every chance she gets. Whether it's making her buy food for advice or suggesting different restaurants knowing she has no money. I mean she's just terrible, she refuses to pay anyone back. And I just can't believe the group puts up with such a horrible person. I'm sorry to people who like her, I just think she's freaking sorry!

Speaking of horrible people, now ill talk about my absolute favorite character. Hiroi kikuri, the bassist and singer of a more experienced group sick hack. A band that is absolutely huge in the underground scene. But sadly the group can't find much success due to their singer being a full fledged alcoholic. Hiroi to me is absolutely adorable, and helped bocchi beat some of her fears. She also helped her sell tickets to kesoku band's first performance. But the people around her definitely wouldn't agree with me. As she bums folks for money to get wasted, passes out in different locations. And even damages the venues where she plays; causing her to be pretty broke. Not to mention the fact that she has some serious issues going on in her head. 

One's that she'd rather drown with alcohol than face on her own. And if you read her spin off manga by the same author, you'll learn a lot more about her. And I hate to say it, but I've been absolutely loving kikuris manga. Maybe even more than bocchi and the gang's story. I guess I'm one of those types that believes I could fix her problems. 

The animation in this show was absolutely fantastic. Not being too serious and having some hilarious moments. But at the same time being one of the most visually stunning shows out now. You could tell the studio made this with plenty of love. It's really needless to say that the music was awesome. From the opening and ending credits to the music in the show. This one really took the cake when it came to catchy tunes. I definitely recommend looking up sick hacks song watashi dake yuurei, as it is totally fire. In fact I wish they would release an entire album instead of just one song.

The show has thirteen episodes and I hear it's getting a movie. While there's no dub, the voice actors really do a good job bringing everyone to life. The issues it tackles pertaining to loneliness and making friends really hit home with me. I can relate to bocchis struggles to try and fit in; it's not easy out there. As I am a person who doesn't get out much but would probably benefit from a group like kesoku band. So if you want an anime that has cute girls doing awesome things. And a show that can teach you a thing or two about making friends. Then check out bocchi the rock, an award winning anime that has made itself a staple in this community of lonely weebs.",False,anime,1707014062.0,1aid8my,Writing

Looking for help finding anime movie!!!,"Hello, I've been trying to find a specific anime movie that i watched years ago. I've searched everything I could think of, but nothing has ever come up related to the movie... I'm hoping that by some insane chance, this happens to be someones favorite movie or they recently watched it.. but the main reason why it's been SO hard for me to find it is because I remember basically NOTHING. Over the past years, I've forgotten more and more about it so this is the only thing I remember about it;

In one part of the movie, it was either near the beginning or somewhere in the middle, a father abandons his two children on a boat in the middle of the night. I think they were near a light house, but I'm not sure (my head is also telling me that the mom was dead, and was part of the reason as to why the dad abandons them). I *think* the two children are girl (older sister) and boy (younger brother) and I think the kids were sleeping when the father took them there and left them, and then the older sister wakes up and calls for her father but he obviously doesn't answer. (And if i remember correctly (which i probably dont) the anime style was similar to studio ghibli)

Stuff that I've searched over the years in hopes of finding this were mostly just ""dad abandons dos his children in the middle of the night anime movie"" and stuff similar to that lol

Yes. This is literally the only thing I remember. I'm not expecting anyone to figure out what I'm talking about, as I honestly have started to feel like this movie doesn't even exist.. as I said earlier, over the years I have forgotten more and more about this movie, I used to remember more scenes, especially regarding this one, but because I took so long to ask for help (I've been meaning to ask for help with this for about two years now..) I remember little to nothing.
I'm not even sure if anyones gonna see this but I'm putting it here anyways just incase lol.

Help me Rent-a-Girlfriend veterans,"Hello!

My favourite character archetype is tsundere so Rent-a-Girlfriend was recommended to me.

I watched up to episode 4 and Chizuru is a fun character to watch but my tolerance for the MC is shrinking.

Does the MC have any character development or does he stay this way throughout? I think I'll have to drop it if he does.

I would welcome any alternative recommendations too. I've seen these animes: evangelion, toradora, nisekoi, UBW, kaguya-sama, railgun. Anything with a tsundere character.",False,anime,1706994462.0,1ai6956,What to Watch?

i really don’t like the over exaggeration about food that characters do a lot (barring food wars for obvious reasons)

just something about the whole “*takes a bite* OH MY GOD ITS SOOO YUMMMYYY” irks me a little bit lol

i also don’t like those scenes where an anime character trips or something and they overreact, saying something like “owwww that really hurt :(“

My point being is that while the show itself is alright, I feel like there are ways that the show could’ve been a bit more interesting with its overall plot, so now I want to see if there is a moe style romance anime that is a bit more engaging to watch, but I don’t know how to explain it as I just want a romantic anime with very solid writing, or at least some conflict in it.",False,anime,1706992220.0,1ai5e9y,What to Watch?

Help. I’m depressed after watching Oshi no ko! 😭,"So, I binged the first 3 books in the manga and the watched the series. Now, ever since I watched it I’ve been feeling depressed. Idk if this is the right place to put this post or not but I seemed like it idk. Ever since I finished them I’ve almost felt like my life isn’t living up to what I feel it should be. I felt such a connection and love for the places and characters of the series and turned around at my life and realizes it’s nothing like that. I live in a suburban area, pretty wealthy, very rustic and farmhouse like. I like big cities such as Tokyo, and I love trees and other such things like that. Although it’s sunny and that normally cheers me up every time I look outside I get depressed. It’s almost as if I’m longing for the the places the characters have gone idk.

Help with domains in jujutsu kaisen," 

After first season I thought I had everything figured out, but now I started second season and I got confused. In first season it seemed that all this strange creatures are curses. Little bit strange, but ok, thats the lore alright. But now I hear there are also cursed ghosts and some things that were called curses are now called cursed ghosts. So wtf? Did the author change conception or I missed something?

Second thing are domains. From first season I understood that they are spaces in which powers of its creators are enhanced and cannot miss. But in the second season when gojo fights in subway, they talk about enhancing and extending domains, but no different spaces appear. So Im guessing they can shape domains however they like and just cover their bodies with it. Also, the creator of domain can use his abilities inside of it, but he can't when he expands or enhances it. Is that right? Oh and also contact with domain forces other fighter to cancel any technique they are using. Do you also have feeling that the author expands certain ideas on the go and doesn't properly explain them?",False,anime,1706986808.0,1ai3dem,Help

This is opposed to English dubs that always try sync the dialogue with the mouth movements so it doesn't look amateur to Western eyes.

"Is Andy, from undead unluck, perhaps the best user of regeneration ability in all of fiction?","I just realized that Andy, from undead unluck, might actually be the best user of the Regen ability, not just in terms of creativity but also in terms of regeneration speed, in all of fiction

The only characters that even come close to his level in terms of regeneration to my knowledge are wolverine, the hulk, Deadpool, Koro sensei and Buu. The most impressive feat I know of would be when Buu regenerated from a single cell, and I don't have any reason to think Andy can't do it too.

Meanwhile, Andy's here casually regenerating fast enough to shoot a finger at a speed comparable to a bullet (if not at the actual speed of a bullet), regenerating entire limbs, and even his whole body, in a second, and shooting blood with enough force to defy gravity and fly. And if you add to it his extremely creative use of his regen ability like making clones by regenerating his body from each finger he cuts off, flying by producing blood in high volumes (that's how I understand it but I might be incorrect), or even supressing his memories, is there really any character that can top Andy when it comes to regeneration?",False,anime,1706983373.0,1ai230b,Discussion

The Reason Why the Payoff in Mushoku Tensei S2 Cour 1 is Very Satisfying.,"I think the author is doing something very smart here. See the author has said he himself believes there are two types of love ""Eros"" and ""Agape""; eros being sexual and agape being emotional. What we see in this story is the author playing out his ""views"" on love using rudy as a surrogate. Rudy comes into this world having only known ""eros"". he is deeply entrenched in porn addiction, and jacking off. He sexualizes everyone when he comes into this world, the first time we see him grow out of his perversion is with Roxy, when he developed something akin to Agape love for her, a deep respect and spiritual attachment. even sylphy got the ""eros"" beem when he found out she was a girl, it's why she didn't want to be around him because he was acting like a creepy old man. To say nothing for Eris, who he defiantly views as only an object of lust. Until her 10th birthday...

The journey back from the demon continent was necessary because it removed him from his family. The Notos family were steeped in Eros. Even his father is a creature of Eros. But the journey back from the demon continent the only adult male supervision he got was from a man who protected children, and who would not let Rudy take advantage of Eris in that way. The multiyear journey changes rudy and he develops deep ""Agape"" love for Eris. and only then was he able to gain ""sex"" and lost his virginity.

The author believes in Balance between Agape and Eros, and Rudy was a creature in Imbalance. Taking Eris away broke him again. But it was needed because Eris ready and willing around him would have fed his Eros badly. See how he struggles to resolve his ED. it's all through Eros solutions. Prostitutes, ready sex friends, the walking embodiment of Eros strolls into his life in Elaniese and even she couldn't ""get a rise"" out of him.

This was the author making it clear the solution wasn't in Eros. So he goes to the magic school and meets Fitz. A gender neutral character. THIS IS IMPORTANT, Fitz is literally ASEXUAL in appearance. He/She is not lewd, is not lewded, he she isnt shown provocatively, he covers almost all of his skin even wearing gloves, he hides his eyes his hair is a neutral white, he barely talks, his voice is gender neutral, the point is you can't find ""eros"" in fitz. And to drive the lesson home, we have the beast girls, living hentai bait, they're willing to have sex with rudy if he's serious about it, but he's not serious about it. he's trying to use them for ""eros"" purposes. feeling their chests, and up their skits, but it doesn't work.

Instead Rudy finds Agape love with fitz. and when Agape love comes back into his heart guess what is ready for Eros... his little rudy.

This isn't a statement about LGBTQ+ or alternate sexualities. this is about the nature of love itself. This is about the two components the author believes are most important to true lasting love. Eros and Agape. And it's an important part of fixing what was broken about the broken person who was reborn in this world. In order to fix him properly his view on love and sex needed to be retrained properly.

-NOTE: the author is NOT against Eros. Perversion and sexual fetishes are a part of everyone. And they're part of the characters of this world. The author isn't saying that's BAD. What he's saying is it's BAD for rudy to get ""easy"" eros... because what he was from the old world was crippled and broken in spirit, and part of that unbalanced and crippled spirit was a porn addiction, an addiction to Eros. This is why this whole arc is here. This is about the reformation of Rudy's relationship with love and sex. with him developing a healthy relationship with both.

What are the best / your favorite animated fights?," 

Animating    fights is incredibly difficult, with all of the complex choreography,    dynamic movement, and special effects that they might involve. We've   all  seen our fair share of still frames and drawn-out monologues. But   once  in a while, a team absolutely sells out to deliver the smoothest,   most  action-packed fight that just makes you think, ""how did they *make*    that?"" Animation also has the distinct advantage of not being  tethered   to things like ""physics"" or ""reality,"" with the things on  screen  bounded  only by the imagination of the director and the  salaries of the   animators. It feels like every year, the industry gets  better and  better  at animating incredible moments, at least when they  really want  to. **What  are your  favorite  animated fights or action sequences, based purely on   animation,  choreography, and cinematography, without regard for  context?** Here are some of my favorites that come to mind:

* [Levi vs. the Beast Titan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0sqfPkCcyM) (Attack on Titan)
* [Zuko and Katara vs. Azula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRkI15fIJ1w) (Avatar: The Last Airbender)

Anime that explore magic like Frieren?,"I don't usually watch fantasy anime. In the past I even hate the fantasy genre. Mostly because the power scaling doesn't make sense. And sometimes like, how did this dude get his power? A few episode ago he got his ass beaten and now suddenly he can defeat the villain? 

But, when I watch Frieren, I really like the way they explore magic in the anime. 

Also, I don't know if this is relevant or not because it has no magic, but, other fantasy anime I like is Made in Abyss. 

Also 2, sorry my english is not that good.

Edit : I just woke up and holy fucking shit there's so many replies. Thank you everyone for the suggestion. 

I see a lot of you recommend Mushoku Tensei. I've watched season 1 of it a while ago but for different reason. I remember watching Gigguk's video and he said it's the best isekai or something like that. So I give it a try. Back then I don't really pay attention to the magic. I guess I should rewatch the season 1 and check out season 2. Also regarding Rudeus, I know a lot of you don't like his character. But, for me that's not a problem at all. I'm not trying to self insert myself into every anime I watch. 

I also see some of you mentioned HxH. I've watched that anime years ago also for different reason. While I think it's a good anime it's not really what I'm looking for right now. 

I think I agree with some of you saying I maybe looking for anime with soft magic system. 

Edit 2 : I know Frieren is not mainly about magic. It's a slice of life kinda anime about her relation to her party member. About a passage of time. Don't get me wrong, I like that part of the anime too. But I also really like the magic aspect of it. And that's what I'm looking for right now. ",False,anime,1706959251.0,1ahtzk9,What to Watch?

"I swear, speed is never scaled properly in most animes","I’m sorry but I’m here to rant.

&#x200B;

* I hate when there are people with energy blasts or light rays attacks, it always seems to travel at the same speed as bullets, like in Star wars. Then there are the fans of an anime that suggest that a character is as fast or faster than the speed of light just because that character either 1: seems to be fast or 2: dodges a light/energy blast.
* Then there are the idiots that think teleportation is a type of travel speed. Teleportation is instantaneous, you get from point A to point B with no travel time, and where there is no travel time, there is no travel speed involved as such.
* If something is moving at light speed, we won't be able to see it moving at light speed as our eyes wont have time to process a moving object going that fast. meaning, it would be invisible. So if we can see moving, it is not moving at the speed of light. This should also apply to characters in an anime, so if a character is moving at light speed, other characters, should not be able to be aware or perceive this as well. (NARUTO STOPPING TRAIN)
* Then there are the characters that are supposed to be scaled to light speed but the mangaka doesn't know how to display it properly. (KIZARU)
* And the only way to become as fast as the speed of light, is if you don't have any mass, otherwise things just do not work. Only way to become light-speed is if you turn into light particles, as light does not carry any mass. (GOOD EXAMPLES: KIZARU AND SHINRA)

&#x200B;

Ending songs are underrated and I’m tired of it,"We all like openings, but I feel like I’m in the minority who thinks a good ending song enhances the experience of watching a series. 
Despite being usually slower, they often represent something deeper about that specific anime, like hinting at the overarching themes and message of the story. And reinforcing a tone for the story/arc being covered. It makes me think EDs are often more honest about what the anime is about than the OP. 

They can also be just as good at foreshadowing as whether it be showing characters yet to appear or events that have yet to happen. 

Letting the song creep in before the episode ends is by far one of my favorite techniques common in anime, or just inserting it into a dramatic or emotional scene. There are just too many good editing tricks that can be done. (Ex: Re Zero, Attack on Titan, FMAB)

Changing the song also is an incredible way to mark a shift in the progression of the story. From either a cour 1 to cour 2, or switching seasons all together. The first ED may be more upbeat and whimsical, while the second is more serious and somber. Re Zero again exemplified this near perfectly. 

Lastly, they also just great for linking the audience to the show. Like highlighting important moments of said episode (ie Lycoris Recoil) to sell either emotion or character relationships even more. 

So next time you are about to skip, at least give it a watch once. A 1:30 seconds isn’t going to kill you.",False,anime,1706931637.0,1ahmpek,Discussion

What happened to the Buddyfight dub?,"
I don’t know if anyone else remembers this show, let alone the mystery I’m referring to. However, this is something that’s been nagging at me for ages, and yet I’ve been unable to find a clear answer.

Let me explain. The show was called Future Card Buddyfight. It was a tie-in for a Yugioh type game that was unfortunately discontinued a few years ago. I was a huge fan of the show as a kid, until late 2015, when halfway through the second season, the English Dub abruptly stopped. They just started posting episodes in Japanese with subs, the dub wouldn’t resume until the fourth season, with the episodes between this point never getting dubbed.

As far as I can tell, there was never any official word on why this happened, nor have I been able to find any comments or interviews from members of the English cast on the matter. I doubt this matters to anyone else, but I Just can’t get out of my head. This is something that made kid me walk away from what once was one of his favorite shows. Simply put, I want to find out what happened to the Buddyfight dub.",False,anime,1706926371.0,1ahl0yt,Help

2) If you could pick a different AI based on an existing Gundam character to appear here, which one would you have liked to see?

3) On a scale of 1 to 10, how absolutely *badass* was Graham cutting that Dainsleif in half? [](#doggo)

The Dangers In My Heart,"I know I’m late to the party, but I’m currently on episode 10 of season 1 of Dangers In My Heart. And wow. Just wow. I trusted others opinion, but I didn’t expect this anime to exceed those expectations 100x. This is one of the best most wholesome romance anime I have ever watched (and I’ve watched sooo many). Everything about it is a masterpiece. They nailed the reality of relationships, the slow burn makes you connect with it on a whole nother level. I love the relatability of the mc. I love how just because he starts talking to this girl and befriends her that he doesn’t all of the sudden break out of his shell and gain a bunch of friends, he’s still a loner, which is way more realistic to me. (I hate how other romance anime tend to follow that trope of I was a loner but I made one friend now I’m super social and have a whole group of friends?) It makes me feel less bad about being a loner myself. The fact that he had such dark thoughts before but then they slowly fade away when he experiences these new feelings, is so real. I love Yamada and her whole personality and how he sees the true her because he’s not focused on the surface level things. I love that he’s not some hottie and that he’s shorter than her. I could go on and on. The only other romance anime that come close to giving me this good of a feeling while watching, that feels real, that are so wholesome are: “Kimi Ni Todoke” and “Skip and Loafer”. This for sure is one of my favorite anime now. Thank you to people who suggested it, thank you anime gods, thank you to Shin-Ei animation.",False,anime,1706891330.0,1ah7p4q,Discussion

Trying to find a Dark Fantasy Anime,"I am trying find a Dark Fantasy anime. Kinda like Goblin Slayer I guess?
I don't mind Isekais either since it's my favorite genre, so if you have a suggestion there, I'll gladly take it.
It must be ""modern"" style anime, like 2010+? I guess. I dont mind older animes at all, it's just easier on my eyes.

Paranoia Agent 20th Anniversary Rewatch One Day Reminder,"Hey, guys. Holofan4life here. 

I am pleased to announce that I will be hosting the 20th anniversary rewatch of Paranoia Agent

##What is Paranoia Agent about?

The infamous Shounen Bat is terrorizing the residents of Musashino City. Flying around on his rollerblades and beating people down with a golden baseball bat, the assailant seems impossible to catch—much less understand. His first victim, the well-known yet timid character designer Tsukiko Sagi, is suspected of orchestrating the attacks. Believed only by her anthropomorphic pink stuffed animal, Maromi, Tsukiko is just one of Shounen Bat's many victims.

As Shounen Bat continues his relentless assault on the town, detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa begin to investigate the identity of the attacker. However, more and more people fall victim to the notorious golden bat, and news of the assailant begins circulating around the town. Paranoia starts to set in as chilling rumors spread amongst adults and children alike.

Will the two detectives be able to unravel the truth behind Shounen Bat, or will the paranoia get to them first?

##Why should I watch Paranoia Agent?

Paranoia Agent is the brainchild of Satoshi Kon. He is the director of acclaimed films such as Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, and Tokyo Godfathers. This is his one and only TV show he was the creator and director for. I've really been getting into his work as of late, and I really want to check out the TV show he created. And what better timing given it's the 20 year anniversary than to watch it with you guys?

Looking for animes similar to…,"
- attack on titan
- my hero academia 
- saiki k
- erased

Okay off the bat I know this is a super disorganized post :(( Ik the 4 shows I listed are all over the place and very dissimilar, but they are the only animes I ever liked (tbf I haven’t seen many) and I’ll list the reasons why I like them

- AOT - one the greatest shows ever imo. The writing was amazing especially the plottwists. My favorite thing tho was the message of the show: *the world is cruel but I still love you* 

- MHA - I love the world building of the show and all the characters are so loveable! I rly like school animes (is that what they’re called?) bc I enjoy the normalcy they provide. Also, i rly enjoy the messaging of this show: *what does it mean to be a hero?*

- Saiki k - this one is so silly and random haha but also very sweet. Again like MHA there’s something comforting abt the monotony of Saiki K, as opposed to the constant plot twists and high stakes of a show like AOT

- Erased - tbh I don’t remember much since I watched it a while ago but I enjoyed the plot twists !

Looking at these, I think what I want in an anime is some sort of found family situation, a classroom environment, good writing w lots of plot twists, and some sort of “deep message” that makes u think. Idk if this makes any sense but I’d appreciate if u guys would share any of ur recommendations! Thank u sm!!

Additional info: Animes that I’ve started & dropped (but am willing to start again!)
- Naruto 
- JJK
- Cowboy bebop 
- Bluelock

Does anyone enjoy watching weekly rather than binging a show?,"Another post from earlier was talking about why the anime Pluto was rather unpopular, and one of the main reasons for this being that all the episodes were released at once. Which apparently generally generates less online discussion then shows where the episodes air weekly. 

&#x200B;

So anyway, it got me thinking, does anyone actually prefer watching a show weekly? I personally just can't comprehend that, but I guess if you're really looking forward to the online responses and discussions for each individual episode it could make sense. But for me personally, if there's a show I like, I'd always wish I could binge it all lol.

I’m currently in the arrancar arc in Bleach, and a few dozen chapters into Dragonball, and at about Enies Lobby for One Piece. I’ve found them all to be pretty good to this point, but none have pulled me in enough to really commit to.

Bleach is good but lacks personality imo. I also know that opinions are quite divided on the most recent arcs so it makes it harder for me to get through some of the more dragged on stuff

One Piece has been quite good as well, the issue is that everything feels inconsequential since I know most if not all of the main big spoilers. It makes everything with Luffy, Zoro, Sanji etc. feel almost pointless since I know there are no stakes.

For Dragonball honestly I’ve been quite enjoying all of it so far. My concern is more just with the fact that it seems like the anime drops off at some point. I don’t mind reading unit generally I like the big moments to be well animated which is why idk about Dragonball lol.

I was on a high after finishing Attack on Titan and I’ve calmed down after Spy X Family,"I am having a really hard time finding an anime that I’d like to watch because both AOT and Spy X Family were really really good, and now I have no idea how to keep watching anime on the same level. 

My sister has been trying to get me to watch one piece but idk I’m not really vibing with it and I’m having a hard time getting started. I’d like an anime that starts off strong, and will get me excited to keep watching the whole time. A lot of anime I’ve heard are good take a while to get going and I’m not necessarily looking for that.

I’m really craving a series with the same level of graphic design, unique lore and world building, mystery and complexity as attack on Titan. After watching what’s currently available for spy x family, I’m ready to get back into a proper series that’s more action and mystery heavy. I liked spy x family cause it was a unique topic and I enjoy “governmental” anime.

I have watched a good chunk of anime, here is is my rough top 10 (not including any movies, or series still in progress in most cases):

1. Attack on Titan 

2. Full Metal Alchemist 

3. Soul Eater 

4. Death Note

5. Naruto and Shippuden

6. Bleach + Thousand Year Blood War (So Far)

7. Spy X Family

8. Tokyo Ghoul (would honestly be higher but the “show” aspect itself sucked. If I read manga I would probably enjoy its manga WAY more.)

9. Fairy Tail or Black Clover

10. Seraph of The End or Blue Exorcist

To be honest, I have watched a good chunk of anime but I’m still a novice. There are many other series I have seen that I’m sure are better than what I listed but I’m just not remembering them if that makes sense. I’m only confident in my top 4. 

The thing is for me what happened is I watched a lot of anime when I was like 12-14 and then I just stopped and then I started again middle of last year but most of it was rewatching old series. 

Idk if I had to summarize what I’m looking for: “An action/drama Anime with a unique world and concept which involves a complex and dark mystery. Involves a government and politics, with an MC who is not cancerous. A modern art style is strongly preferred. ( I’d prefer something a little more mature, but I don’t enjoy fan service anime. )”

I tried getting into JJK but I’m not impressed by the first few episodes. I’m not really looking for a regular battle shonen but I may try JKK another time.

Recently started Vinland Saga. I am interested but I’ve been in the mood for more fantasy rn.

Good anime with bad/misleading titles that turn people away?,"I was thinking about this a while back watching DanMachi season 4. It's alternative title, Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon - actually threw me off for a long time. I didn't start watching the series until season 4 came out. And while the first 2 seasons weren't quite as good, it certainly was not what I expected. Then s3 came and I really liked it, then s4 was such a banger I was hooked! I also have a guilty pleasure for watching fantasy anime with OP MC's. Whether it's isekai or non isekai, (also bonus if actual romance involved with a clear choice/the romance actually goes somewhere) a lot of them are definitely generic and similar but for some reason, I like them lol. It's not that I think they're all great, I just enjoy watching them for something to watch. But there's a lot of those that have really awful names as well. One I rewatched recently was 'The greatest demon lord is reborn as a typical nobody' and while the first half was pretty generic, I really liked the tone shift at the end (even if the time travel stuff had a few plot holes). The characters were fun as well. But again, the name sounded so..generic and blah, so it took me a while to watch. 

I think DanMachi's alternate title people know it by  is one of the most popular titles that people agree with being very poor and misleading for the most part. Any other shows come to mind specifically?

Edit - another one I forgot was Chivalry of a Failed Knight. While the name actually does make some amount of sense once you watch, I thought it was going to be a waaaay different show after watching the first minute and going off the name of the show. I figured it would be some generic romance where nothing kicks off until the last episode where they finally admit they like each other. 

I was very surprised that 1) the romance blossomed quickly and the ""tsundere"" heroine was actually a great character and 2) the ""failed knight"" had way more about him than just being a..failure. the fights were also surprisingly pretty hyped and the last fight was mega hype.

I love Blast of Tempest, for it introduces shakespear which is well from before my time and hard to understand. and they do so in a freaking brilliant display of magic, emotions, love and fates.

I love Piano no Mori, for it introduces classical music in a form that adds meaning and thought behind the pieces of music being played. As a kid I never liked classical music and before this anime I never cared to understand it, now I love it and listen to it on a regular basis!

I love Your lie in April, for it touches upon a tough and difficult to comprehend topic. Death and how it can affect people around you, but more than that, it tells a story on how to rebuild oneself, either by people around you, by accepting reality and or by doing the thing you care about most.

Getting sad/empty feeling after finishing anime.,"

Hello, so I just wanted to know how can I distract myself / help myself from moving on with sad/empty feelings after watching anime (I know that the best thing to cure something is time but other than that?)

Some info:
I just finished 3 days ago The Eminence In Shadow season 2 which was ok didn't really leave that much of empty / sad feeling, I started watching a new anime the same day, which was the one that gave me this emptiness... 
I started watching Heavenly Delusion, and I just loved it, and I honestly think a little bit of that emptiness and sadness came from Reddit 😂, since i was googling to see when season 2 is out and to know a little about just some info about the anime, and then I see Reddit comments about people understanding so much about what happened in the anime that the anime itself didn't explain very well, some things that shocked me but can't say here cause of spoilers. So yeah anyways just the fact that I didn't watch an apocalyptic movie/anime or whatever in a long time already kicked me but also the little romanticism, the heart dropping cruel scene, and the plot itself, and ALSO the 300 questions that just popped in my head is making it difficult to relax, I really enjoy watching anime and I have a few series already ready to watch tomorrow if I get better, also there the FACT that Heavenly Delusion was released in spring 2023 so we won't see the 2 season for a long time probably.

Digimon Adventure 25th Anniversary Rewatch Interest Thread,"Hello everybody. Normally a person would think that after hosting a pretty long Rewatch, one would take a break and take things easy. Alas I am not normal and Anniversaries call me. 2024 marks the 25th Anniversary of Digimon Adventure, and you bet we're gonna be here to celebrate it with a Rewatch.

Of course, some of you may ask...

---

#**So what are these Digimon things?**

Digimon, short for Digital Monsters, is a Series of V-Pet games… as in, Tamogatchi-esque stuff, for the normies. You have your little device thing and a Monster's inside it and you have to raise it. It'll probably die if you don't do your job properly (Or will die anyway… hey, that's how life works), so… do it properly. The game eventually exploded in popularity, leading to videogames, Mangas, and, of course, Animes.

However at the end of the day, Digimon stories, to me, are first and foremost meant to be an Adventure. No matter what, this is a Franchise that should strive to instill a sense of wonder upon the viewer, and all the best installments of the franchise, in my opinion, have done so. And of course, here we are to watch the one that started it all…

Yes I know about V-Tamer, shut up, that doesn't have an Anime so we'll have to make due with this. ~~V-Tamer rocks though, so read it when you get a chance.~~

---

#**Okay but what is Digimon Adventure?**

In a world just like ours, in the year 1999, there were 7 Kids in a Summer Camp, [the hot-headed Yagami Taichi, resident tomboy Takenouchi Sora, the loner Ishida Yamato, the genius boy Izumi Koshiro, the spoiled and bubbly Tachikawa Mimi, the crybaby Takaishi Takeru and the debatably reliable Kido Jou](https://i.imgur.com/IFns6D0.png), witnessed a strange event as it suddenly started snowing… in the middle of summer. However as they went outside to check what was going on, they ended up being dragged by a strange force into a whole new world, one populated by the strange creatures known as Digimons. These children must now find their way back home, and in the way, discover the many wonders of this brand new world.

If the premise didn't spell it out for you, yes, Digimon Adventure is a fucking Isekai. That being said, it predates the modern concept of it by a good few years, thus a lot of the tropes don't really apply here. The kids for one thing are *genuinely* helpless when the Digimons aren't around, meaning they oftentimes have to use their wit to get out of trouble until the Kaiju fights start. Also, yes, the heroes are all kids and they very much act like it: These kids are far from the pinnacle of maturity and are prone to doing really dumb, stupid shit as a result.

Given how this is a kids show, the tone is relatively light, however it is very much commendable how willing it is to tackle very real subjects that can sometimes trouble kids with a surprising amount of maturity. The show always treats its audience with respect, and while obviously the setting is fairly fantastical, the sources of many of the kids' problems can be eerily relatable.

In spite of all that though, at the end this is very much a fun roadtrip first and foremost. The world of the Digimons is just such a lively place that it's hard not to be engaged by it, it helps that it is very well rendered out visually. The actual animation is… not the best, mind, but if nothing else you always have [the late great Arisawa Takamori's OST](https://myanimelist.net/people/7424/Takanori_Arisawa) to keep you entertained during the higher stake moments.

---

#**Okay, where to watch it?**

Uh… yeah this is where the problem starts. As far as I can tell, there are no streaming service on this side of the world that have the show in full. Now to be clear, recently [Discotek did release the show in Blu-Ray](https://www.amazon.com/Adventure-Complete-Japanese-Language-Collection/dp/B0C47ZWJYD), but of course that means shelling out over 60 bucks which I know some of you may not be comfortable doing. So… [yeah](#piracy)

---

#**Wait, what are you talking about, isn't the show on Hulu?**

[About that… ](#godisdead)

See, Hulu does indeed have the show… it's just dubbed only and I'm sorry to say, I cannot recommend it for this Rewatch. It was done by Saban in the early 2000' and let's just say it is pretty heavily cut down. Not only is the whole music replaced entirely with one that was, to be frank, far worse, but more importantly the script has taken a bit of a hit, being considerably dumbed down and just generally being unable to stay quiet. Therefore, for this Rewatch specifically just… don't bother.

---

#**Well, fine. So when are we watching this?**

We'll start on March 6th, not with the show, but rather with [the pilot movie directed by Hosoda Mamoru](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2961/Digimon_Adventure_Movie). After that we'll watch the show proper, then the *other* movie, [Our War Game](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2397/Digimon_Adventure__Bokura_no_War_Game) and then we'll have a final discussion on. Combine this with a break day right before the second movie and we have the Rewatch lasting from **March 6th-May 2nd**, with threads being posted daily at 9pm UTC (That's 4pm EST when it starts before switching to 5pm EST when daylight saving ends).

---

#**NO SPOILERS**

This show isn't the most plot-twist heavy, but nonetheless be careful when talking about spoilers. If you'll do so (Or aren't sure if it is a spoiler), then use the little spoiler code thingy as indicated on the side of the Subreddit. Do note you'll have to switch to the Markdown Server or old Reddit as the fancy pants one breaks the formatting. Oh well, it's just something that must be done...

So a  very long time ago my brother had a lot of Anime on his PC, Most shows i didn't really like until i stumbled on 2, ive been trying to find them but i have looked for hours unsuccessfully and hoping someone can help.  


the first was a show about a male in his teens. He very immature young adult.   
His (i believe its his aunt if i remember correctly) for some reason drops a little girl off with him and he has to take care of her. i remember it being a story of how he grows as a person, ends up dating a girl with all the jokes being around the little girl. like she would sometimes get jealous ect.

&#x200B;

the second at first reminded me a little of naruto but then ended up being something very different. was a samurai kind of guy with a straw hat i think(sorry my memory is bad) but it was somewhat dark. the main character was a good guy that just went around helping people but unlike most anime he did not hesitate to kill the ""bad"" guys. I remember watching it and thinking that it was more realistic in its world to what would happen if people had ""powers"".  There was even a scene where 2 people with powers where fighting and the one won and ended up raping the other. think it was a plant lady of some sort.

"What anime handled the ""Amnesia"" arc/trope/plot the best and the worst?","This is half looking for recommendations and half discussion.

A while back, I spoke with a friend and they just casually talked and ranted about how much they **hated** when an anime or story in general handles amnesia. They mentioned how most of the time, it feels like a regression of character and that it's hardly (if ever at all) done properly, and it's always used to create drama for the sake of it. 

I didn't initially think much of it until I saw this comment on a completely unrelated post which said roughly the same things. It could've been a coincidence, but I just wanted to read more into it. Which is when I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/17zjdzk/why_does_everybody_hate_the_amnesia_trope/) in r/writing from just recently. Seems the common viewpoint it's rarely done properly or some even said isn't a trope that has much to offer. Now I'm curious if whether the amnesia plot has ever worked well in anime cause truth be told, I don't see a lot of anime with amnesia despite it being labelled as overused. 

Also half discussion cause I want to see you guys' insights. Since you'll be naming one or two examples from anime, I was hoping you could share what made x-anime handle the amnesia aspect better than y-anime. Thanks!",False,anime,1706809220.0,1aggpxi,What to Watch?

Calm and “Beautiful” anime for 8 year old nephew?,"My nephew has recently gotten a bit anime obsessed via Ghibli movies and I would love some recommendations of stuff to watch with him, films or series.

His favourites have been Totoro and Kiki’s Delivery Service because, in his words, they are “beautiful”. From talking with him I think he likes the calm, mostly conflict and threat free nature of them, combined with the amazing artwork in those films. He’s very emotionally intelligent and the characters journeys in those films really resonate with him.

He didn’t much like Castle in The Sky because it had too much action, and he really didn’t like Spirited Away because of some of the more alarming elements like the pig parents and No Face. 

So any recommendations for calm, no violence, low threat, quietly moving anime with fantastic artwork?

(EDIT: I should have said, those with good English dub only. I don’t think his reading level could keep up with the speed of subs.)",False,anime,1706804429.0,1agesjq,What to Watch?

"Newer to Anime, Looking For Recommendations-Feeling Lukewarm About Some","Hello, firstly I wanna say I love this sub-you guys are extremely helpful! I also understand that it’s frustrating to recommend something without parameters so this is gonna be a bit long.

I’m newer to anime, just started watching last year, and I’ve watched a decent amount so far, but I’m hungry for more!

Here’s what I’ve watched so far:
Attack on Titan (need to watch last 2 episodes)
Tokyo Ghoul
Code Geass
Chainsaw Man
Blood Lad 
Castlevania
Banana Fish
Neon Genesis Evangelion
Devilman Crybaby
Hellsing Ultimate
Noblesse
Death Note
Berserk (1997) (2016-17)
Parasyte: the Maxim
High School of the Dead
SpyXFamily (haven’t watched season 3 yet)
The Devil is a Part-Timer! (Through Season 3)
Servamp
The Case Study of Vanitas (through part 2)
Mignon
Blassreiter
Terror in Resonance
Steins;Gate
Cowboy Bebop (currently watching)

Movies:
Code Geass: Re;surrection
Weathering With You
A Silent Voice
End of Evangelion
Evangelion (4 alternate universe movies)
Promare
Princess Mononoke
Howl’s Moving Castle
Laputa: Castle in the Sky
Grave of the Fireflies
Spirited Away
The Cat Returns
Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind
Whisper of the Heart
Ponyo
My Neighbor Totoro
Vampire Hunter D
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
Spriggan
Saezuru Tori Wa Habatakanai

To add more parameters:
-I usually HATE watching TV shows, especially long ones, so I would prefer a shorter one (If I have the option, I usually grind out entire TV shows in a week or two)
-I usually don’t like shows that are “unfinished” and prefer an anime that is finished or will be soon finished
-I love sadder/grittier stuff (LOVED Berserk, Grave of the Fireflies, A Silent Voice, Banana Fish)
-I LOVE vampire stuff, but only really like the more “lore-heavy, secret-society” vampire stuff (if that makes sense?)
-I’m not too fond of many of the “anime tropes” (don’t know what to call it)  but not a deal breaker!
-Of these above, Code Geass is probably my favorite and was my second anime I watched and I’m still chasing that high
-I thought Death Note and Steins;Gate were good, but they weren’t a good as praised to be honest although the rest of the anime I’ve watched I really enjoyed!
-I don’t really have a specific “genre” I’m looking for really, as my watch list has REALLY bounced around a lot
-gundam (just learned what that meant) is not my favorite, but is fine as long as it’s not the #1 focus of the anime

Also, I’ve been recommended the following anime, but I guess I feel “lukewarm” about them I guess?:
Monster
Legend of the Galactic Heroes
Japanese Tales of the Macabre
Demon Slayer
Iron Blooded Orphans: Mobile Suit Gundam
Vinland Saga
Psycho-Pass
86
Moriartry the Patriot 
Black Lagoon
Grand Blue Dreaming
Castlevania: Nocturne
Valkyria Chronicles
Innocent Venus
Another
To Your Eternity
Jormungand
Akame ga Kill!
Darker than Black
Linebarrels of Iron
Kuromukuro
Wolf’s Rain
Inuyasha
Bleach
Your Name

My qualms with: LOGH is that there’s a lot of episodes, Castlevania Nocturne, Moriarty the Patriot, and Psycho-Pass is that their stories aren’t “finished” yet so I’m hesitant to start them

So, after all that, I’m desperate for your help, if you have any recommendations please send them my way! Or should I just suck it up and watch what already on my recommended list? Thank you so much!

I’ll try my best to respond to any follow up questions in the comments or DMs!",False,anime,1706799281.0,1agctnh,What to Watch?

-he’s a young kid with probably brown hair ( memory is hazy but I’m pretty sure he had dark hair )
-There are 2 sides of groups in the jungle one red and one blue, all their clothes and banners are color coded to their assign group and they hate each other 
-he was born into the blue side but fell in love with a girl from the red side ( Romeo and Juliet like ) 
-he has a pet armadillo ( sidekick )
-the chick also had an animal by her side but I don’t remember what it was 
-there was an episode where they went into a temple and something attacked them and turns out that the armadillo and the boy might be magical? It was weird

Senjougahara and Yukino are easily among most loved waifus among all anime fans. There's no doubt about that. If there is scene that implies  these two got involved with any other dude (Kaiki and Hayato Hayama) other than MCs, then people who loved those waifus start to call her derogatory terms used to insult promiscuous women. They suddenly lose all forms of love and devotion they had for their waifus.

Full Metal Panic! for not a fan of mecha?,"I had been dismissing anime with mecha among its genres for a long time, until I happened upon a gem that is Eighty-Six, which lead me to discover that not every show under the aforementioned lable involves big battle robots. And so I’ve been checking if that’s the case ever since. 

Then, fairly recently I somehow slipped into watching Trapped in a Dating Sim, which turned out to be an absolutely hilarious piece. That’s how I’ve come to realize that If the robots are explained with magic, not technology – they won’t bother me either. 

I still doubt I will ever be able to take seriously any solemn story in which big battle robots play a significant role, but having made previous steps, I’m now wondering if perhaps Full Metal Panic! could become the next one?

Who typically gets credited for their work in an anime episode and who doesn’t?,"So at the end of a feature-length film, the credits are massive and it really feels like mostly everyone gets credited. But while we do see credits in usually the ED of each anime episode, I can’t help feel that they aren’t including everyone. I certainly don’t see all the names of the animators who worked on each episode. I am not sure if that is because there are more moving parts in anime as production is split on a per episode basis or if there is no real obligation to really do so.

So my questions are the following:

1. Who is responsible for overseeing the credits for each anime episode? Is there a name (romaji) for this job, and is this done during post production?

2. Freelancers do get contracted to work on a commercial anime. Yet we don’t see their name in the anime they helped make unlike subcontracted studios. Why is that?

3. Circling on that question, are credits determined by an obligation in a contract? 

4. Do credits have to appear on the anime episode or is there a legal document that lists everyone’s involvement in an anime episode? I say this because anime episodes that are aired on TV have a set time.

5. What happens when someone is supposed to appear in the credits, but was missed?",False,anime,1706753184.0,1afzld0,Discussion

I've stopped watching all shounen animes because I can't get past this, but still love anime like Hellsing, Monster, Ghost in the Shell, Ergo Proxy, and Darker than Black. 

My question is, are there other anime genres that don't feel like the typical shounen where every character needs screentime gasping at how powerful the MC is every second?

Seasonal Comment Face Nominations - Winter 2024,"#**Hey Everyone!~**

[](#modsalute)

We are once again into the depths of an exciting new season! So once again it is time to rotate the the seasonal comment faces. We will be accepting nominations till **midnight February 9 UTC**.

#***Give your feedback on the last seasons faces***

We have a [short survey form here](https://forms.gle/JoMr4UQLdLumDc7s8) to see what faces were liked and how they compared to the season before. ([Results viewable here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGbdpFohdBLmCLecxXPU5uuGpFDRg8sIlABnbLId4llYWAYA/viewanalytics))

[](#concealedexcitement)

#***Wait, what even IS a comment face?***

If you use Reddit's redesign, or any mobile app, then comment faces won't be something you see. They are a legacy CSS feature supported on [old.reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/). To post a face, you require a bit of formatting and the name of the comment face and that displays the relevant image. For example:
    
```[](#awe)```

Becomes: 

[](#awe)

[We have a full wikipage with all faces and instructions how to use them here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/commentfaces)

#***The seasonal faces are:***

[](#seasonalapproval) **#seasonalapproval** | [](#seasonalblush) **#seasonalblush** | [](#seasonalconfused) **#seasonalconfused** 
:--------:|:--------:|:---------:
[](#seasonalcool) **#seasonalcool** | [](#seasonaldepression) **#seasonaldepression** | [](#seasonaldisapproval) **#seasonaldisapproval** 
[](#seasonaldisdain) **#seasonaldisdain** | [](#seasonalfoodie) **#seasonalfoodie** | [](#seasonalhype) **#seasonalhype** 
[](#seasonallaugh) **#seasonallaugh** | [](#seasonallisten) **#seasonallisten** | [](#seasonallove) **#seasonallove** 
[](#seasonalneat) **#seasonalneat** | [](#seasonalpout) **#seasonalpout** | [](#seasonalshock) **#seasonalshock** 
[](#seasonalthink) **#seasonalthink** | [](#seasonaltired) **#seasonaltired** |

The named #themes are intended to be broadly interpreted. So we encourage you to submit great faces even if they don't perfectly match, as we may find a space for them. 


#***So how do I nominate a seasonal face?***

The series must be currently airing as part of this season, the image can be from a previous season if the show is a sequel. Movies/OVAs that have become accessible between seasonal nominations are allowed. To keep things diverse, we aim to pick one face per anime, so nominate those under watched gems!

Make as many nominations as you like as comments. Include the image, the name of the anime it is from and the #name(s) it fits for. If you like saving my time, [posting in this format is best.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/10vmhq8/seasonal_comment_face_nominations_winter_2023/j7invi2/)

Nominations will be open until **midnight February 9 UTC**. We look forward to seeing your suggestions.

Who were some prominent anime creators (or studios) who were gone too soon?,"Forgive me for maybe a more... grim topic, but in a fit of boredom I found myself wandering to the AniList page for *Cat Soup* and had to ask*.* Today I learned that Masaaki Yuasa was a large part on why that short film cooks as hard as it does (which is cool), but I also learned the grim tale of Nekojiru (which is less cool).

A couple other rabbit holes later and here we are. I'm fascinated with the idea of the auteur and tracking the careers of prominent anime staff that always left their mark on whatever they touched. The grim side of that is that not every artist gets to ride off peacefully into the sunset. So I'm curious what other examples y'all have dug up of artists in the anime sphere who tragically met their end before their time? I know Satoshi Kon and Yasuhiro Takemoto are probably the most infamous examples, but are there any other names you want to draw attention to?

While we're at it, are there any studios or other creative entities you know that similarly seemed to burn out quickly but brightly? Kitty Films comes to mind as the production company that brought Rumiko Takahashi into the world of anime in the 80s only to fizzle out by the 90s or Manglobe that oversaw names like *Samurai Champloo, Michiko & Hatchin,* and *Ergo Proxy* throughout the 2000s before going defunct in 2015.",False,anime,1706741576.0,1afvbcq,Discussion

So I've been trying to find an anime that I watched way back, but my memory is hazy around the details. So this is a total hail mary.

The show is not newer than 2003 and probably not older than 98'-99'. It's an absurdist comedy with a team of girls who has pretty much useless powers. One of the powers is, how I remember it, Earth Falldown. She just falls over. 

They do battle against either monsters or aliens and one of the antagonists rise up from the ocean. I also remember wooden poles stuck in the sand at the beach when they do battle.

I'm turning 30 this year and when I was younger I watched a lot more animes than I do now. I liked “old” animes like OG Dragonball, Inuyasha, Cowboy Bebop, and Neon Genesis Evangelion. When I got together with my wife, I got her into anime and we watched Naruto, Sword Art Online and Attack on Titan together. Nowadays, she watches more anime than I do and everytime, she asks me to join her but I can't enjoy for some reason ""newer"" animes like Jujutsu Kaisen or Demon Slayer (her favourites). It feels like I have lost something on the way.. I don't know why but I think it's the newer artstyle of these animes. They look so clean and flawless in contrast to the ""good old, hand drawn"" animes. However, I wanna do my wife a favour and watch a show with her together.

My journey in Anime so far,"So far I have watched anime series like Demon Slayer, Romantic Killer, My happy marriage, Chainsaw Man, Naruto and movies Spirited Away, Howls moving castle, Arietty, Ponyo, basically all the Studio Ghibli ones.

I fell in love with Demon Slayer. The characters and the story line were very interesting. Each fight interesting techniques and each Demon backstop was very moving. The other series that I loved was Romantic Killer. I was hooked right from episode 1. Other than these 2 anime series, I couldn't find other series that are as interesting.

No offense to any fans, but Chainsaw Man was bad. There were no techniques or anything interesting in the fights. There was nothing particularly moving, and no character was worth remembering IMHO. I started Jujutsu Kaisen and I was basically forcing myself to get through till the 9th episode. Again, the fights weren't interesting, no scene in all the 9 episdes kept me to the edge of my seat.

Love is war is another anime that is supposed to be really great. But man, it was too cringe and bad that I couldn't make it past the 2nd episode.

Is it just me or are there others who also feel the same way? I really got into anime after Demon Slayer. I kept searching for other acclaimed anime to watch but I keep getting disappointed on watching them. 

So far the only anime I have LOVED is Demon slayer, Romantic killer. And all the Studio Ghibli movies <3

Anime recommendations for someone in need,"Hi, I'm looking for a new anime to watch and I have this vibe I'm looking for but I have no idea what I'm looking for. I'm interested in watching an anime that's a little grungy, medium pace that has a bit of a plot to it and not very slice of life but a little soft like one but a little bit of something extra that happens in the universe. Maybe a little bit artsy in a way, more mature in nature but not a lot of fan service and not isekai. kinda thinking along the lines of something similar to Air gear, Bleach, Durarara!!, Blast of the tempest, Bungo Stray Dogs, Tokyo Goul, Blood Blockade, Noragami, The Unlimited Hyobu Kyosuke, Beelzebub and Gangsta. I have no idea if any of those anime fit into the vague vibe, I described or anything in common but I would appreciate it if anyone could help. Thank you",False,anime,1706716710.0,1afl3r6,What to Watch?
Any one else notice this common issue with anime?,"I started watching Inuyasha for the first time and was surprised how solid the world building was. After thinking about it it was less that inuyasha had a great setting and more that many anime tend to completely forget about the setting.

I don't know if some one else has a better name for this but i call it ""in a bottle syndrome"". Over time the story of many anime feel more and more like they are in a bottle and not at all part of a bigger setting.

Examples would include when the heros fight the villian for a long time and the rest of the world seems to dissappear until they are done, stories set in modern times where people forget police and hospitals exist until its dramatically convient, or most common of all when you get long running anime were there are almost no extras, as of the important characters all exist in a pocket dimension with other important characters and no one else.

I consider this a problem but its not a deal breaker, there are plenty of shows I have enjoyed that suffer from this. I just really appreciate when the setting is fully realized and reacts to the protagonists. It's a layer of depth that many of the all time great anime remember and many good anime do not.",False,anime,1706716609.0,1afl2f3,Discussion

I don't like or watch anime but I am starting to find anime girls very attractive. is this weird/common? Am I turning into a neckbeard?,"I am not into anime but my younger brother always watches it. I went to a anime convention with him last year on november. it was the anime con in NYC at javits center and it was his (and mine) first convention. I saw a lot of merchandise and stuff about half naked and lewd anime characters.

  
he downloaded and watches services like ""crunchyroll"" on his ps5 and when Im in the room as him I also end up hearing and watching the shows a bit.

I never really found cartoons that attractive, I watched things like animated superhero shows with characters like starfire and wonderwoman and I did think they hot but nothing like what I am feeling with anime?

Like the way these ""anime"" characters are drawn somehow entices me? Like their eyes and even hair?  
and its not just their appearance but its also their personalities and voices that somehow entices me?  
out of curiosity I started searching up ""ecchi"" and I found characters like ""rias gremory"" to really captivate me? like the way her body is shaped and detailed, her hair, her eyes, and the way she talks and act really entices me?

sorry about the long body text but I just feel kind of shocked and embarrassed about it. I never felt this way about other animated characters like ""jessica rabbit"" or daphne from scooby doo or any other ""hot"" animated character.  
theres something more charming and attractive about anime girls.  
Like am I turning to a neckbeard?

EDIT: also Why are anime girls so much hotter than other animated characters? Like I never felt this way towards ""jessica rabbit"" or any disney princesses or any video game characters like daisy and princess peach from mario.",False,anime,1706715528.0,1afknlh,Help
Looking for suggestions of a deep/extensive storyline,"I'm really craving a specific type of anime and struggling to scratch the itch.  Looking for something in the vein of FMA/brotherhood and 7 Samurai or Ghost in the shell.

Shonen or Seinen is cool so long as there is a complex storyline with pay off and a lot of purpose.  Character development is really important too. 

I'd like something dark and brooding but small comedy elements are welcome as long as they're minimal.  

Not to be too specific but either a realistic outdoor setting or a dystopian metropolis setting would be best.  More on the drama/horror/sci fi side than the fantasy side but I'm open to suggestions.

Desperately Looking for Anime Recommendations,"Hey Anime Family! I was hoping some of you could help me out here, I'm a huge anime lover just like all of you, my tastes range from Isekai, Romantic Comedy, Slice Of Life, Heart Warming, Feel Good, Adventure, Reverse Isekai, Shonen, Harem, Parody and many others but I think those are the biggest for me. The thing is in my real life I suffer from chronic anxiety and depression and in that regard Anime is like a double edged sword to me. When I find a good anime that I enjoy it genuinely helps me, I'm the kind of person who feels everything our favorite protagonists feel when they feel it. 

Whether that be happiness, sadness, anger, world ending terror and everything in between, I'm going through it with them and I enjoy that while I'm watching it because it genuinely distracts me from how depressed I am in my own life I should add that I prefer to stay away from depressing themed animes that have too much suffering or sadness in them, I can deal with some, but for one instance, I'm torn on Re:Zero Starting Life In Another World. The reason why is because the characters, the story, the world building is AMAZING and its one of my favorite animes hands down. However, the depressing apsects if it are genuinely bad for my mental health, it makes me so unbelievably depressed that at times I wish I never got invested in it because now it's too late and I have to suffer as they suffer because I love them. 

Another thing I'd like to add is that it KILLS me when an anime I get into gets canceled or rather in the anime world the forever unknown because they never actually cancel it, we just never hear anything else about it andnwe go on forever hoping it'll get picked up for another season even though most likely it won't, apart from some rare cases like ""The Devil Is A Part Timer!"" Man I was so happy when that got a new 2 cour season even though it was soo many years later. When the anime is left unfinished it breaks my heart and it never leaves my mind which nowadays just seems like the norm unfortunately because as we all know Animes are just a way to get more people to buy the light novel and / or manga. 

So all of that being said (and I'm really sorry this post got away from me and got so long) I'm looking for recommendations for some great anime that are already completed (not canceled) and had a proper ending or its close to being completed (last season coming soon, or so insanely popular there's no way it won't air to completion). SOME of the many animes I've seen and loved (and yes I know some of these haven't finished airing and might not finish and it breaks me, sometimes when I run out of anime to watch I get anxious and have to pick one that's still ongoing, unfortunately for me)

If you guys can help me out with some recommendations based on this list and even if it's something different, if you think it's a good anime, and it has a proper conclusion, the anime finished without being canceled, please throw it my way! I really do appreciate your help everyone thank you so much and I realize this is a long post and goes into a few different issues I have personally so I would really appreciate it if nobody would pick on me for that. Thanks again everyone!

As ideas I would like to say what I've seen and I'm a fan of: Dragonball ofc, Yuyu Hakusho, One Piece, Attack on Titan, Bleach, Demon Slayer (first 2 seasons), Jujutsu Kaisen (just 1 season), Cowboy Bepop, Samurai Champloo, 7Samurai, Akira(movie ofc), Captain Tsubasa (thinking about trying Hajime No Ippo), Solo Leveling (new series) and things related to this genre or style and I think I've watched the OG anime shows.. (i know, i haven't watch full metal alchemist, i don't feel attracted enough to it so i could watch it).

Gundam Witch From Mercury S1 Episode 8 thoughts,"Ik this aired like a year ago, but I was just watching it for the first time when I got this horrendous realization, and I needed to talk about it. Suletta isn't just a pseudonym for Eri so they could avoid the council. Suletta is a new daughter, or maybe a clone of some sort like Erlan was, and Eri was made into Ariel. It just makes too much sense. Eri was 4 years old in the prologue, and Suletta is 17 now, but they say the Vanadis incident was over 20 years ago. It makes no sense unless Suletta was born after Eri was. 

And look how hard Suletta & her mom are pushing the fact that Ariel is family to them. Suletta probably doesn't know it yet, but was taught to think of Ariel as a sister because the Mom wanted them to still have a connection. Also, think about what they said a Gundam was. It's the fusion between man and machine. What better way to fuse them than to literally combine them into one? That's why there's no burden on the pilot of Ariel when they do the Permet thing. The Gundam itself is taking on the burden so the pilot doesn't have to. And remember how Suletta's mom said that they definitely couldn't mass-produce Ariels? It's because it requires the sacrifice of someone with a very strong affinity for the Gundam.

Last and final point, look at the fucking names. Ariel? Eri? Coincidence? I think not.",False,anime,1706689645.0,1afd6e7,Discussion

"Help, I'm looking for recommendations","Looking for recommendations

I'm trying to be less picky with anime, but after watching a bunch if stuff I just didn't really like i want to take a break and hope to find something I will be more likely to like.

I'm looking specifically for something where the MC is some kind of demon, monster, vampire etc like supernatural type creature. Can be part or full that doesn't matter too much. They can become on later in the show or early on.
I prefer more action based and less romance. Don't really care if its dark or kinda silly. 

Some I've watched and enjoy are:
Blue Exorcist,
Tokyo Ghoul,
Yu Yu Hakusho,
InuYasha,
Fairy Tail,
Toilet Bound Hanako,
Rise of the Yokai Clan,
Seraph of the End,
Attack on Titan,
Case Study of Vanitas,
Soul Eater,
Kemono Jihen,
Chrono Cursade,
Demon Slayer,
Seven Deadly Sins,
Bleach,
Black Clover,
Black Butler

I know it's a rather specific request, but I've always loved supernatural things, and I just want to find something else that peaks my interest. I know there are quite a few that are supernatural but the MC just stays human and something about it bores me more than I care to admit.

If you could recommend something I'd appreciate it, can also be manga I'm good reading if its not animated yet.

Was Misty the worst handled female companion of the Pokemon anime?," 

I've  been rewatching the original seasons and  notice how Misty gets  sidelined most of the time. Any time she tries to  battle or do  something epic, Psyduck would come out interrupting her for  the usual  gag.  Outside of that most eps focus on Ash and the random filler  characters  they meet in every ep, so Misty and Brock are largely just  treated as  exposition characters commenting on whatever is happening.   Most of her pokemon are underused too, and it feels like if you don't   care about shipping half the appeal to her character is lost. You'd   think 275 episodes would be enough to develop her but eh.

After  rewatching the entire anime recently I can’t help but realize the   writers never seemed to care for Misty much in the series, at least   after the original Kanto season. Takeshi Shudo the original director of   the first series flat out said he thought Misty was the least justified   Kanto character on the cast and didn’t really contribute much to the   show. He was deciding whether to remove Team Rocket or Misty from the   series by the end of Johto and went with Misty. She then stayed gone   because May became popular with the original fans after she left and the   Contests became the most popular addition to the show at the time, so   that convinced the writers to make her departure permanent, and it’s  why  they even went as far as stopping her cameos for 12 years between  Hoenn  and her recent Sun/Moon cameos.

But back to Misty:

She’s  arguably the least focused on female companion of the series, with  far  less screentime than nearly all the female leads who came after  her.  She’s in the most episodes of course, but she was basically  sidelined  as a background character especially after she got Togepi and  we got  into Johto.

Misty also did the  least amount of battling of the first four main  girls, prior to Serena  and the SM girls, Misty was known for hardly  battling in the show at  all. Most of her battles were constantly  interrupted by Psyduck popping  out, and the few battles she does have  like the Cerulean Gym, match in  the Giselle ep with the kid with the  Graveler, princess day ep, etc,  she either ties, loses or uses other  Pokémon then her own. In Orange  Islands she only battles once the entire  saga against Marina in that  Golduck ep. Then for most of Johto she  barely battles at all, outside  of eps like the Totodile one, till the  tail end with the Whirl Cup.

Misty’s  pokemon were also all underused. Most of her Pokémon with the   exception of Psyduck and maybe Poliwhirl got very little screentime in   the series and no characterization. Most of the time it felt like the   writers forgot Misty even had Pokémon. Her team was mishandled from   start to finish.

That being said I  still like Misty, she had some good eps and she was  better handled  when she returned to the Gym and she got better  development off screen  as a Gym leader than she ever got as a main  character. It’s just too  bad that despite a lengthy run of 275 episodes,  Misty is seldom ever  able to get any focus in the series outside the  odd filler episode.

It’s  interesting how they gave bigger roles to the female leads who came   after her, particularly May, then Dawn, but also even Iris got a bit   more focus, and Serena and Lillie had their characterization too. It’s   also like May was given her tomboyish temper at times, Dawn had the   close friendship with Ash, Iris had Misty’s old role, and Serena got the   crush.",False,anime,1707952842.0,1ar0xgr,Discussion

Future Diary is underrated. Go watch it,"I unironically think Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) is an iconic, pivotal, and masterpiece quality anime.

1) Yuno Gasai is THE yandere. She's the character that has become the basis for the archetype of a ""Yandere"" in all of anime. Also name ONE battle Royale anime you can think of that was better executed than Mirai nikki.

2) The story is both engaging and well written. Great premise and combat mechanics. If you're watching Mirai Nikki, every episode is gripping and has you on the edge of your seat. Pacing is great. Minimal slice of life material, and almost everything that happens is relevant to the plot. It isn't predictable at all either, no one saw the plot twists coming.

3) The production quality is top notch. The sound design: the sound of diaries changing is haunting, the sound of explosions, and just sound effects are well designed. The soundtrack is amazing: watch the show and tell me the action scenes aren't hype thanks to the music. Animation is top notch too: great character design, fluid animation, and great shot composition. You at least have to give it that

The REAL reason people hate Mirai Nikki is because Yuno and Yukki are annoying. There's a solution to that: WATCH IT IN DUB.
- Yunos Japanese voice actress comes off as high pitched and whiny. Her American actress is a lot less annoying for American audience. People underestimate how big of a difference this makes. Same goes for yuki
- Yuki is roasted for being the most pathetic, weak protagonist ever. A lot of people mistakenly take this to mean ""bad character writing"". Yuki is SUPPOSED to be a pathetic, edgy, cringy loser. It's intentional for the plot. Notice how every other character has the same reaction to Yuki as we do: he's NOT supposed to be sympathetic and if you watch all the way through you'll see how he pays for choosing to be weak and letting yuno manipulate him.

Anime that is entirely flashbacks,"I'm wondering if there is an anime that's entirely based on flashbacks, meaning that a character from the future could be retelling it, or a character recaps the plot, or it's all apart of the character's memory, something like that.

My favourite example for this is Kakushigoto because it has a mysterious aspect to what happened in the future as we get glimpses into how the past is like.

If this counts, Teasing Master Takagi-san seems to be based off adult Takagi's memories sometimes, as we see her going through an album or remembering the past.

I guess Attack on Titan could count too, Armin is basically recapping/retelling to us

Quintuplets might count as the bride's memories because we see flashforwards of the wedding often

Sub and dub viewing?,"I watched Campfire Cooking in Another World  last year and it became one of my favorites,  recently, I saw that the English dub was available and I was curious regarding the quality of the translation and the voice acting. Three episodes in and so far the dub has been solid.  The storytelling and humor hasn't been watered down (adding a little extra inner monolog here and there helped)and the majority of the characters sound the way I imagined them in English (special props to the actors for Fel and Sui...they made me crack up all over again).

What are some more of these warm/bittersweet openings?,"What I mean by warm and bittersweet are these openings that use cuts of the characters just hanging out or going about their days to contrast other more serious things happening in the opening. Lately these are shooting up my list of favorite openings when everything is considered and not just the music or animation.

I found that these OPs tend to use gestures very well, which help to break out of the monotonous stock actions you usually see in anime like running, fighting, turning, just standing there, hand reaching, dropping into the water and all the clichés.

Do any of you feel similarly about this? What other openings do you know of that use this technique to help craft this sort of mood?

Looking for Anime that tell a complete story within 36 - 52 Episodes,"As time goes on, I start feeling like 2 cours just isn't clicking for me.

The ones I've seen like Steins;Gate and Summertime Render feel like reeeeally long movies (in a good way). But they don't feel like... A series, if that makes sense. 

2 cours (20 to 26 eps) just feel like it's not enough to give me that fulfilling experience. I want to feel like by the end of it, I did go through this long story with the cast.

So I'm taking anything that starts at the minimum of 3 cours (36 eps) to the max of 4 cours (52 eps). Max of 4 cours because that'll be an entire year's worth of anime in one Binge. Also also! Good pacing would be much appreciated! I can take slow shows, but **slow** shows I can't. My preferred genre (as of writing this) is the more fantastical adventure ones like Lord of the Rings, so having a more ""fun"" story works great, doesn't have to be mature. I'll take a children's story so long as it can be entertaining for people over the age of 12 (I'm 19). 

This season's Sengoku Youko I've heard will tell a complete story within 37 episodes. That sounds great. 

There can be some exceptions like FullMetal Alchemist brotherhood where it goes for 63 eps, but for the lost part still fits? (I say 52 eps, but if something can seriously give me the fulfilment of the FMA ending, I'd take things that go over.)

Seems like the Precure series all tell the main story within 52 eps, I'll check that out. Any genre is fine really. Horror, thriller, action, Shoujo romance, shonen romance, adventure, fantasy, you name it. I'm open to anything so long as its engaging... But no slice-of-life, at least nothing entirely slice of life. 

Death note can fit here. It really did feel like a long journey with Light.

Attack on Titan fits in terms of the progression I want. It feels natural and the conclusion is one thst feels conclusive instead of the ""open to more adventures"" type of ending, but it goes over 100 eps which is way more than what I'm looking for lmao. If I were to pull something from western works (aside from Lord of thr Rings), how to train your dragon 3 felt like a true ending. I'm hoping for something like that. An ending where the story truly feels like its run it's course. 

I'm fine with long shows, so long as the pacing is okay. The issue in found with a lot of old shows (as in shows pre 2000) is how stiff a lot of shows are. I suffered watching shows from the 60s and 70s.

The show being split into multiple seasons is fine too, so long as they ultimately tell 1 big epic story rather than each season feeling like their own contained season. So multiple seasons telling one big story rather than 2nd season or 3rd season feeling more like sequels than a ""direct continuation."" 

Stuff like One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail, ~~Boruto~~ or really most long running battle Shonen's are out. They all go over 100 episodes and most of the time are filled with filler and padding.

On the common complaints I see against revealing armor and gear in fantasy settings.,"I absolutely understand that minimal armor covering and form fitting clothing is less effective if you are only considering the pure protection that gear can offer a person.  If that is the only consideration, then every character should always be carrying a massive shield or just never go outside at all.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ygaqgm0jclic1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba1b118d2fa4ecdd0bbec41f09c2eddb6950a6f9

Consider the most common revealing attire you see people wear in real life, in public.  In my experience, it is fitness clothing.  Sports bras, muscle shirts, spandex shorts, small and form fitting items.  Why do people choose those clothes? Because they are easy to move in, which is also the most common response that characters use to explain their choice.  There is also the pride people get from displaying the fruits of their efforts, in the same way others can get from showing off their expensive fashion or other signs of material wealth.

If seeing any display of the things people are proud of is what makes you uncomfortable, I suppose this line of thought may not be very convincing.  But I think it is important to understand that most things in fantasy settings are metaphors for real world things.  For example, there aren't real dragons atop mountains of gold with a princess locked in a tower. But there are old rich people who hoard wealth and have partners that might appear to be unfitting matches for them.

Just something to consider. That said, I don't really hold it against anyone if certain things just make them uncomfortable.  I just think it is important to try to make sure your opinion doesn't ruin somebodies day and to consider their experience, too.

We move onto the next scene, villain is sitting in his office and hears a hiss sound (the noice snake makes, I don't remember if it was rattle or hiss sound). The villain thinks that his aid (the snake woman) has returned and welcomes her back. He turns his head to only be greeted by silence and remembering that he used her as a scapegoat and now somewhat regrets it.

"Obscure movies like: ""The House of the Lost on the Cape""?","Hi everyone,

I have obviously watched all Studio Ghibli movies etc. but in September last year I stumbled upon ""The House of the Lost on the Cape"" I and I was blown away by how good it was.

There wasn't much info about it on the internet and so I wasn't expecting that it'll have supernatural elements in the form of kappa etc. as no descriptions of the movie even mentioned it.

The art style was amazing, animation was incredible, story very good and it had some of the best music I've heard in any anime.

I'm not really into watching any anime series aside of Dragon Ball when it comes out and I really only watch anime when my partner is away, since she doesn't like it at all. She's currently away for a week and so I wanted to watch some good anime movie.

Long story short: does anyone knows about any other obscure anime movies worth watching and maybe similar to the movie mentioned in the title?

I'd really appreciate some suggestions :).",False,anime,1707912811.0,1aqlgy6,What to Watch?

(Edit): It took place in a more futuristic looking city, he was being chased by thugs when he turns into the alleyway and meets the woman I believe she was seriously hurt or dying and all I remember is that he had blood on his face and it was raining.

Anime Opening / Ending SONG that gives You strong Nostalgic vibes even if You do NOT know (or keep in mind) the context of it.,"My picks (I recommend listening to the FULL versions, not the Anime formats):

&#x200B;

**Berserk's** Ending (""*Waiting So Long*""). It's naturally painful (which fits greatly within the context of the final episode, as well). Maybe too depressing, not leaving that much room for the ""sweet"" part in ""Bittersweetness"" that defines Nostalgia. It may seem more like Melancholy, I guess. But it still gives me the feeling of longing.

&#x200B;

**Oban Star Racers'** Ending (""*Waratteta*""). Probably the best one here after Berserk's, for me. Definitely better balanced than Berserk's, though. After the final episode of the show it hits even harder, just like Berserk's. And I'm not even a fan of this Anime ;p

&#x200B;

**Kill la Kill's** Opening (""*Sirius*""). It's so weird to have KlK here - an extremely action oriented over the top comedy show that doesn't have any particularly sad moments in it, but when I've recently started listening to the song separately, without looking at the images, I've realized how melancholic it is thanks to the chorus. 

&#x200B;

**Mushishi Zoku Shou's** Opening (""*Shiver*""). The official Music Video for this song is nice too.

&#x200B;

**Monster's** Ending (""*For The Love of Life*""). A really beautiful, hypnotizing piece.

&#x200B;

**Saint Seiya's** Endings (""*Blue Forever*"" and ""*Blue Dream*"").

&#x200B;

**Saint Seiya Hades'** Opening (""*Chikyuugi*"").

&#x200B;

**Shin Captain Tsubasa's** Opening (""*So Long Dear Friend*"").

&#x200B;

**Death Note's** Ending (""*Alumina*""). 

&#x200B;

**Shokugeki no Soma's** Opening **(""***Kibou No Uta***"").**

&#x200B;

**Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood's** Ending (""*Uso""*).

&#x200B;

**Naruto's** Opening (""*Namikaze Satellite*"").

&#x200B;

**Naruto Shippuden's** Openings (""*Closer*"" and ""*Diver*"").

&#x200B;

**Bleach's** Opening (""*Asterisk*"") and Ending (""*Mask*"").

Did Anyone See Ninja Kamui Premiere?,"What did you think of Ninja Kamui Ep.1? Was it what you expected? Will you be watching this one this season? Did anyone else think it felt like a 10 minute short?  I caught the episode premiere by complete coincidence Saturday night when I just found myself wanting to see what is airing on the Toonami block in current year. What did everyone think of this one? Ninja Kamui? I enjoyed the episode though from start to finish. I’m super interested in where the show goes from here! I hope it becomes a big show for the block! For anyone wondering it’s on Toonami and HBO Max.


Also, for anyone interested in what I thought of the Toonami experience in current year:


Toonami looked like it was in a sad state. There’s the popular series to be expected (DS, Naruto, OP) and Lycoris Recoil I’ve seen online, but there were also a couple series that looked like American cartoons being marketed on the Toonami block. I didn’t recognize them. I was disappointed the block ended early. It used to go until 4am CST when I remember InuYasha used to play. It ended around 3am instead. I also remember for a time it started earlier back when MHA was on the block. Going from the usual 11pm to 10:30pm CST. Is this what streaming has done to Toonami? I love streaming, but I feel bad for the Toonami block. I have so much nostalgia for the block even though I was always primarily an online anime viewer and only a sometimes Toonami viewer. It was still an experience to just watch an episode of a show on tv again without context of the rest of the series. I’m not caught up to DS. I only just started the Entertainment District arc. Ep.5 aired that night.",False,anime,1707886660.0,1aqes93,Discussion

the formula for it is how big is the fanbase divided by how known it is in the anime scene plus the square root of how many foreign dubs it got&how many viewers the show got in other non japanese countries to the power of how hopeless you are to have watched it in full.

thats how i concluded durarara is about a 6 on the weeb scale, lucky star is a 7 and yosuga no sora is an 8.5

rules are:

1) just being an ecchi or just being a furry anime or the likes of that no matter how extreme isnt a dead giveaway. highschool dxd was still massively popular, just like how beastars is also pretty big
2) itd be too easy to just go on mal and go to the bottom of the top anime list. instead anime that are just blatantly obscure, look like lost media or had 0 effort in them and like a 100 viewers in general or are just really old dont count. you should still be at least somewhat able to make out an audience somehow

Whats a mundane anime moment that you just can’t seem to forget?,"To elaborate on what i mean. Whats a moment in an anime that is completely normal, nothing really happens in the scene that significantly impacts the story or the characters but something about the scene just permanently etches itself in to your memory for whatever reason.

In my case and if we are talking recently. I can’t seem to forget the scene from the dangers in my heart season 1 where ichikawa buys this matching keychain thing with his sister because he intended to give it to yamada as a souvenir from his trip but his sister thought it was because he wanted to have a matching keychain with her. Long story short his sister found out he wanted to actually give his side of the matching keychain to yamada and she leaves her keychain with him so they can match after she realized that he gave his keychain to yamada even though his sister was already using the keychain and was happy to share it with her brother.

Two things made this scene so memorable for me. The sadness that his sister might have felt (i know its a headcanon because it isn’t directly implied that she was sad) knowing that it wasn’t meant for her or just how good of a sister she is for letting them match.

opinion on ''rushed'' anime?,"a lot of anime adaptions are unfortunate enough to be rushed, for a variety of reasons.

&#x200B;

while i do find it annoying that a really great manga just didnt get the adaption it deserved, i also contradict myself by enjoying them regardless as a ''alternate story''

&#x200B;

an example of this is Akame ga Kill

&#x200B;

the anime was pretty rushed imo, with a lot of arcs not appearing whatsoever in the anime, and i'll call the anime the ''bad end route'', whereas the manga finished the story, had a ''good end route'' and also got a sequal.

unfortunately, if you only watched the anime, the sequal manga would NOT make sense at all.

&#x200B;

and that takes us to the next point, and where my greatest irritation lies...

&#x200B;

glorified ads for Light Novels.

&#x200B;

there are SO many manga and anime that has ended short because they were just commercial product to get people interested in the Light Novels, one that i was so dissapointed was treated this way was ''Chivalry of a Failed Knight'', with the anime getting an even lamer treatment (aside from obvious good production value), i just find it annoying that a good story thats come far is now axed because they dont need it to commercialize anymore.

Bruh seriously, you just did something nice for the character, and they teared up because of that good deed. How can you not see the connection? It's pretty clear they're emotional because of the positive action, not because something's wrong.

lf animes with a very specific edgy vibe,"don't exactly know how to explain it other than edgy and pretentious highschoolers daydream but in the best way possible. Cringe culture is dead <3

examples I can think of are code geass, pycho pass, death note, tomodachi game, no game no life, akuma no riddle, angel of death, banana fish, madoka magica, magical girl raising project etc

animes like monster also fit here,but I am looking for something that requires less braincells and more entertaining

basically edgy, smart and morally questionable mcs or those that are  narcissists with god complex (but also the type of character that will be worshipped on tumblr).

bunch of mind games, better if the mind games involve life or death situations, doesnt actually have to be smart or well written just should be important for the characters

generally dark and angsty vibes, better if the genre is horror but not necessary. 


also it would be great if it has some form of friends to enemies, enemies to friends/lovers, or some heartbreaking betrayal

if you read so far,  it would be great if you can drop some animes down. I do watch anime often, so more obscure or older titles are welcome.

Its okay if the anime is incredibly sexists or has weird stuff in it, I am used to it sadly. However I would appreciate if no excessive lolicon, no game no life was so hard to watch.",False,anime,1707862648.0,1aq6a7e,What to Watch?

ANSWER TODAY’S QUESTION(S)

What is your favorite bottle episode of anime where it mostly takes place in one setting?

What do you think Maniwa has to say to Mrs. Ikari?

If Maromi is indeed Shonen Bat, how much do you think Tsukiko knows?

Bonus) If I had a nickel for every time Ikari has gotten isekaied, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird it happened twice.

Sad that he dies, but I understand why the death was necessary to revive the flat line that was Thorfinn's character arc throughout this season. Second half of the season was definitely better than the first, but I'm still wondering why they chose to make the protagonist the single worst character. The emotional beats of that death scene don't really hit when the protagonist has been insufferable the whole time and there's no reason to really care about his journey in the aftermath of the far more interesting character's death.

"If Light Yagami from Death Note, as Kira existed in this world today and was able to accomplish what he did in the show would you cheer him on?","Yes Light was a POS. But doesn't the end justify the means?

Objectively didn't light save millions of people? Is that not justified?

Option A) Light kills 10000's of criminals with a some innocent dying. But he stops all wars and 70% of global crime = millions of people are saved.

Option B) Light does nothing. Our current justice system puts innocents in prison/on death row (4% estimated on death row), wars continue on and the crimes continue on. 

Also our current justice system doesn't convict politicians or people who start wars. Light would.

&#x200B;

Isn't Option A just objectively better?

EDIT:

Here's another scenario:

Let's say you are driving and are about to run into some pedestrians.

Option 1) Do nothing and hit an a group of 4 women

Option 2) Turn your car and instead hit a single man.

Option 3) Attempt to stop your car with the possibility of causing an accident and possibly endangering or saving both lives.

Is Option 2 unjustifiable?

I remember the characters having to use a watch gadget (could be sth else)to transform into their battle suits, their suits looked kinda like a mix of kaimen rider and power rangers, i seem to remember they were mainly white costumes.

I also remeber one of the episode plot was a concert/roadshow was under attack and one of the main characters lost his/her gadget and had to scramble to find it, and then the team arrived and kicked butt etc etc,

It could only be a one off episode in another show, i really cant remember, i was in the US and it aired between 1990-2010, or it could be on VHS tapes, i think i remember it having a english dub so it must have been localized.

Does anyone remember Angel Tales?,"One night, I was scrolling through Tubi looking for a new anime series to watch and then I stumbled upon Angel Tales. It’s an anime about an unlucky unemployed man in his mid-20s, named Goro Mutsumi, who has trouble finding a job and is down on his luck until one night, he meets a group of teen girls who suddenly appear in his living room and they are his guardian angels who want to be of service to him. These girls are actually his previous pets that past away and were reincarnated into human angels, and their mission is to serve, protect and take care of him. Some of the girls had romantic feelings for Goro and were fighting over who gets to feed/cook for him, buy him medicine, make sure he’s safe, etc., but they were supposed to work together in being at his service, regardless if they were attracted to him. 

I really liked this anime even though I haven’t finished it all. It’s very adorable, sweet, charming, and childlike but it gets sad at times, especially when the girls talk about how they died as pets. This anime is 22 years old (aired in 2001) and I’m just now finding out about it. I highly recommend it to those who love cute or “childish” anime or magical girl, but I wouldn’t call it magical girl since the girls didn’t transform or didn’t have goals regarding saving the world. Their only goal was taking care of Goro. There’s 12 episodes and it’s available on Tubi.

art by anrio -- a collection of some of my favorite characters drawn beautifully,"A fun way I've found to cement my love a show/character is to commission art of characters that I like...it's great! You get a bunch of great art, and you get to support real, human artists. You should all do it, regardless of who you commission!

Over the last...year and a half or two, I've ended up commissioning a lot of art, and in particular, a lot of art from an artist whose work I really love, anrio!

A gallery of his work that I've commissioned:
https://imgur.com/a/1PLCPqv

(actually, one of these got posted almost a year ago https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/12xif3u/i_drew_rem_from_rezero/ that was my commission ;)

Regardless, I really love anrio's style. I think it is true to the anime visual style, but also has a sort of...distinct, fashion inspired look to it? I dunno. I just keep coming back with characters I care about, and he keeps making incredible art. I also like artists who draw in a more traditional anime/manga way and have commissioned many, but I appreciate anrio's particular style, I think it's absolutely gorgeous

(note: I did ask anrio if he was cool with this but this was completely on my initiative, not his. I just really like his art and love these commissions and wanted to share it with the sub. if you like his work, [consider getting some of your own](https://anrio-commission.carrd.co/)! though I think he might be considering taking a break...)",False,anime,1707834631.0,1apusse,Fanart

How do you objectively rate an anime?,"The recent post about “anime you think are objectively bad” had me thinking about this. Aside from stuff such as animation, voice acting, the art, which I think can be measured objectively in some ways, how do you call an anime objectively good or objectively bad? As in how do you rate an anime based on the more core aspects such as its story, the characters, pacing, plot development, etc. People often mention plot holes and inconsistent character writing but I feel like a lot of plot holes can be interpreted subjectively or might not affect someone’s enjoyment of the story as much as someone else.

1. MHA (This is the anime that gave me the most **radically** intense goosebumps, I've ever felt in my whole life, that i didn't even know was possible to experience, It also has one of the best OP's)
2. Fairy Tail: (I know, don't get me wrong, I am very aware that Fairy tail has some flaws (1. Ironically No blood when a character gets injured, 2. friendship power), but it's one of my first anime, at the time I watched it i was a lving masterpiece, the medieval-themed OST makes me literally experience euphoria, No anime **ever** beats fairy tail in OST's )
3. Tokyo Revengers: It has one of the best openings in the history of anime, The magical emotions I felt while watching it, The amount of tears I shed, The liberating experiences It made me undergo, The dramatic personality of Takemichi, The legendary delinquent, gang street fighting theme that was unheard of before
4. OP: Anyone who has watched long running anime, knows the profound bonds you develop with the characters, The way the drama is expressed here, is legendary, Luffy's character development is #1 in the history of anime
5. Date A Live: the G.O.A.T romance drama  + really great battles
6. Tensura: Every time I sit down to watch this anime felt like a breath of fresh air from life. It’s just so **fun**, it gives off a super tranquilizing vibe to watch + it has epic action scenes + crazy, Fluid animation
7. JJK: Self-explanatory
8. Kobayashi's Dragon Maid:  It's the best SOF anime I've ever seen, Nice storyline, very Funny, heartwarming moments, and most importantly, CGDCT <3 
9. Undead unluck: Very unique plot, magical OST and OP's , crazy events and gorey fights make it an immersive bizarre adventure

Why do people love anime so much? not trying to hate," 

I have been wondering why people are so in love with anime and i am not trying to talk shit or hate.  


I have some friens i play games and talk to a lot in discord and they watch a lot of anime together in there but i never get the feeling that i like any of them, and i know many of you will say ""you have not found the right one yet"" but i have seen so many different ones now by just watching what they watch in discord its been animes like JJK, Hunter hunter, AOT, solo leveling, Spy x Family, Love is war and the list goes on

And i was wondering what makes people so obsessed with anime? Like i said i am not trying to talk shit or hate but for me from the outside people who watch anime are kind of like vegans, its all they talk about and only thing they talk about on the internet, all the pfp that they use is anime ones and all the gifs is always anime ones, I think its nice people have found something they really love and for me that is Lord of the Rings i watch that shit so many times a year i even watch so much lore videos to learn everything about it but i am not throwing it around everywhere that i love Lotr or even if i meet another guy that also loves it i just be like ""oh shit nice me too"" and i move on but i feel like a lot of people who love anime only talks about anime

So if anyone of you guys out there have any answers from your pov on what makes you be so ""obsessed"" with it

Was Pluto underwhelming as a mystery story?,"Maybe i had my expectations too high when people said this was one of their favorite mystery animes and don't get me wrong it had some great character moments especially the whole north no 2 segment,  epsilon and his connection with the kids and Gesicht's whole arc .

While it excels at exploring these characters the overall plot and mystery was lacking. After the whole build up over 2 or 3 episodes they just throw the answer right in our face.  Like sure the main details were still uncovered but we knew Abullah was heavily involved the moment he showed up.


I might have missed these so ill hv to ask:  

1. how does pluto magically have the abilty to change the weather grow flowers etc


2. Is dr tenma stuipd?  He created the most advanced robot who is now impersonating a high official of a dangerous country and he does nothing for years?  

3. What was the deal with brau? He somehow knew everything abt everyone and the best part upon atom's request he is able to escape prison ,  intercept the secret room of a powerful president and shoot the main villian. Speaking of whom was it even explained in the show what his deall was? 

4.  They had to introduce hate in the most advanced robot to make it work yet brau and Gesicht were able to feel hatred by just going thru stuff? Why doesn't every robot who suffers hv a similar thing feel these emotions then?

5. So if they tried hard enough or had a genius like tenma helping all the dead robos can be revived like atom was?

6.Also i get suspension of disbelief but some of the most famous ppl/robots are being picked apart 1 by 1 and u basically have only 1 primary detective robot on the case working at his own pace?  They just sent Gesicht to warn them to be safe.  Not rounding them up and hv them under 24/7 surveillance nothing.

7. Everytime someone makes a breakthrough they barely share it and worse yet try confronting pluto alone despite the same the same thing happening again and again.  

8. Maybe the manga explains it better but why were so many characters just stuipd did the president have no brain of his own or that lady at epsilon's orphanage letting them take the kid behind his back.

Theres also small issues like sometimes conviently flying arnd in the car to reach across the ocean yet struggling to loose a tail while driving on the road etc.,  rumors of goji existing before he was even created.

Kingdoms of Ruin is horribly overhated.,"To start by no means am I going to claim this show as some kind of masterpiece, however calling it trash is a pretty bad take. 

The animation is amazing. The story and characters go hand in hand and simultaneously progress and influence each other, the world-building is really solid and while the side characters aren't that interesting as of yet, the main cast compensates for it.

Based on the reviews and responses I have read , it mostly comes down to people having very wrong expectations about the show. The biggest consensus is that people expected Mc to just spend all 12 episodes mindlessly genociding everyone however the story takes a step back instead, to further develop the characters and the plot which I liked a lot.

Now it does have plenty of problems, my personal biggest gripe being that it has one of the most versatile power systems used in one of the least versatile ways. Other than that it was a very enjoyable show with some nice but not mindblowing plot twists. Overall I would give it a very weak 8.

**3)** Gold vs Silver Instruments (when the choice is available)? 

**Comments from Yesterday:** 

These may not be the actual best ones (there are upvotes y'know), but well, I decided to pick them. (i.e. completely subjective by me lol)

The Boondocks - Japanese Dub: A Case for Cultural Preservation in Localised Translations,"One of the classic scenes in the American animation of Boondocks is when Huey was explaining the intricacies of the ""N-word moment"". In addition to the localised Japanese translations for Japanese audiences, the American cultural connotation of the N-word was preserved very well by allowing the dub to literally use the same amount of N-words in that very scene, despite the offensive nature of how the N-word was supposedly meant to be used by black Americans within that culture.  


This is a case for an argument against English localisation of Japanese animation where the Japanese cultural context can sometimes be modified, or worse, removed, simply because it didn't ""feel right"" with American audiences.  


In short, if American animation such as Boondocks can allow Japanese localisers to say the literal N-word for the preservation of contemporary American culture, surely American localisers can also seek to preserve the Japanese cultural context in Japanese animation? If Japanese dubs can be allowed to say the N-word, surely, American dubs can be allowed to at least be allowed to use the senpai and kōhai culture when they are localising Japanese animation?  


The senpai and kōhai culture is simply one example I have seen American localisers REMOVE for the sake of ""flow"" and ""American audiences"". There are plenty of other cultural contexts in Japan that Americans censor sometimes because it didn't fit certain ""progressive"" or ""inclusive"" values that didn't work in the same way in the context of Japanese society.

Girls und Panzer fixes that for me, most of the communication in combat is minimal and the presence of the tanks paired with the sport aspect makes it both ""real"" and ""unreal"" at the same time.I cannot find something that gives me the same feeling as I got when I watched the scene where they take out the artillery while Finnish polka plays in the background and I want that again.

Which anime ruined another anime that was your favorite,"I think we are biased towards anime we watch before many others, always comparing it, finding similarities between them. It doesn't matter if the anime we watch first is more recent than any older anime we may watch later, it's not the release order, it's your watch order that matters. I believe only after you watch a certain amount, you can stop comparing shows needlessly.

Even then, what is that one anime which ruined other similar ones? Which anime was strong enough to force you to overwrite your favorites in certain genres? What **was** your favorite, and what is your favorite **now**?",False,anime,1707763310.0,1ap7ci1,Discussion
Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: The darkest storm in the Cosmic Era,"The last few CE stuff was whatever, but this anime is absolute dogshit. The story is just the 1st series & Zeta smashed together into one incoherent mess. The returning characters are complete shells of themselves. The new characters are hardly likable. And worse of all, anything that made the original special is completely gone. It's now 2004 and nearly every anime was the same; overly edgy, too violent, and of course poorly animated. This was often called the worst entry in the series and it's time to find out why.

* Plot:
   * 2 years after the Bloody Valentine War, ZAFT not has their Gundams stolen, but are now made a scapegoat for the break the world incident. So it's up to the Minerva crew to fight off the Earth Alliance. Meanwhile they encounter the Archangel and must decide if they're for or against them.
   * Right off the bat it adds nothing new. It prides itself in mainly being on ZAFT’s side of the conflict, and honestly it's not even an interesting concept at all since we've seen their perspective already in the previous show. That's why I never understood why this was the main selling point since it was done already.
   * Also like the 1st show, it copies entries from old entries. This time around, it copies Zeta Gundam to…… Not very positive results. It only copies the superficial parts and not much else. Like it copies the fight with the Psycho Gundam, but understanding what made it good (and I'll get to that). Or certain MAIN CHARACTERS, it's easy to see where they flopped. And to add insult to injury, it also copies the 1st SEED too, with 3 modified children stealing Gundams. Hell, the second half of the series just rips off SO MUCH of the original SEED when it comes to fights. Kira getting his ass blown up & surviving to even the final fight in space, it's nearly the same anime beat for beat.
   * So we're not off to a great start. This show barely tries anything new and when it does it fails miserably. It just feels like the plot is constantly having an identity crisis. And I'm not even at the bottom of the barrel.
* Characters:
   * If you thought the characters in the last show were a mixed bag, it has nothing on these guys. They really dropped the ball on these guys, from returning characters being underdeveloped to new characters that nobody asked for, there's a lot to discuss. So just this once, I'm only gonna focus on the characters who desperately needed a rewrite. So to any Lunamaria and Talia simps, I won't be talking about those 2, along with other characters.
   * First let's start off with the one who could've easily saved this anime, Athrun Zala. I've praised him for having a really good character arc where he learns that ZAFT aren't as good as he thought. Yet he doesn't have a character arc whatsoever. Anything he does in this anime is the same thing he's done in the previous anime. All he does is babysit a hellspawn and commit adultery.
   * Speaking of which, let's talk about how much they butched Cagalli. She's basically an old shell of herself and just follows along whatever happens. She did show promise in the beginning as she now runs Orb and even towards the end when she gets her own Gundam (again), but not only does she lose control towards the middle, she also doesn't even use her new Gundam. She only used the damn thing once and that's it, talk about wasted potential.
   * Another woman with little to nothing to do is definitely Murrue Ramius. I'm surprised barely one brings up how much wasted potential she has as she also doesn't do a damn thing till Neo reveals his true identity, and oh boy… Do I have some to say about that. It turns out this mysterious Char Clone is no other than…….MU LA FUCKING FLAGA. Ya, the man who got vaporized by a fucking warship survived. I'm not even mad that he survived something as insane as that, I'm more mad that they only brought him back just to give Murrue something to do. Seriously, almost all of the returning  characters are treated like garbage compared to new characters.
   * Speaking of which, let's talk about them for a second, they're not really the worst, but boy do they fumble with some of them. The “Extendeds” would've been interesting characters, but they get heavily mud balled halfway through the series. Sting Oakley & Auel Neider are honestly underutilized as they barely get any chance to shine as characters or get any form of redemption as they're just brutality killed off. The only one who gets to shine is Stella Loussier. And her one interesting trait is that she's “afraid of dying”, huh? Ok, the fear of death is a really relatable trait, but not to the point where scratching people's faces off or attacking them when the word “death” is even mentioned. Like, Jesus woman, get a grip. But outside of that, she's dipsy I guess, it's kinda hard to describe her.
   * While we're on the subject of villains, let's talk about these 2 dipshits; Lord Dijbril & Yuna Roma Seiran. One is the most evil & the other is just a straight up dumbass. Both of these assholes aren’t even effective enough villains who feel like a threat, they just feel a tedious obstacle.
   * But there’s one character who I utterly despised, a character who make the anime worse by appearing, Shinn Asuka. He’s easily the worst character in the anime, or better yet, the worst Gundam protagonist period. I know say that for at least one character for these reviews, but this time I mean it. He’s whinny, he talks down to everyone, and never takes responsibility for his actions. If anything, honestly the worst written character in the series. He doesn’t have any form of character development, his perspective on ZAFT is never challenged, and he honestly has a really dumb motivation to hate Orb. He hates Orb because of the invasion of the Earth Alliance and blames them for not beating them sooner? That sounds like you should be against EA more than Orb, who actively tries to protect its citizens. A lot of people say he would've been a good character and those people are on crack. I just don't think he would've been a good character to begin with.
   * While I've spent most of my time bitching about how bad these characters are, there are still characters I think are alright. Gilbert Durandal is honestly a pretty decent villain as his political power is what makes him untouchable with his grasp on information control. Meer Campbell could've also served as a compelling character as someone impersonating her hero, and seeing the toll it's taking on her mentally. Hell, I genuinely felt sad for her death as she just wanted to be like Lacus. Now speaking of vich, I thought Lacus did way more to do here than the previous show, as she exposes Durandal’s shady actions and brings Athrun's Gundam by piloting it herself.
   * However, there's honestly one elephant I want to address before ending the characters section, Kira Yamato. Everyone says he's the worst in this show, but if I'm being honest, he's probably one of the only character in the show who I can actively stand. He's not as good as he was in the previous show, but I was honestly more invested in his side of the story opposed to Shinn’s or Athrun’s, because it's him & Terminal up against all 3 factions. That's more interesting than one dude babysitting a man-baby who can't control himself. However, there's one thing that’s holding him back from being a good character, his plot armor. I didn't mention this in the first SEED review since that felt irrelevant at that point, but now it's worth discussing. Not once, but twice he survived his Gundam getting blown up in the most over the top way. I think instead, his Gundam should've just been heavily damaged and sunken into the ocean. These fights already take place over the sea, so just having it sink would show off how the fight was while not shutting down the idea that Kira could've survived. I dunno, if Heero can survive that kinda shit, why can't Kira. I also thought that fighting against the Destroy Gundam was dumb, but I'll get to that later.
   * So overall, the characters really fell flat, REALLY FLAT. What's worse is that they could've been good characters if written differently. I remember hearing why most of the characters were poorly written because there was some in-fighting between the writers in the studios. And that's such a shame because studio drama will always reflect on the final product in some shape or form (take a look at Blade Trinity). So overall, the characters range from wasted potential to why do they exist.
* World building:
   * The world building is also a mess because of how it barely adds anything to its universe. For starters, we're not supposed to question how fast Orb gets its land back. Because the 1st anime took place in CE 70, this anime takes place in CE 72, 2 years later. Jesus those coordinators have fast hands. And that's just the beginning, the Junius Treaty also adds nothing to the plot. Apparently, they banned N-Jammers, N-Jammer Cancellers, and Mirage Collide for military use. And yet here they are used for whatever tomfoolery EA & ZAFT are up to. Even the limit of the number of mobile weapons is pretty stupid. The Earth Alliance sure as hell ain't following that shit, just look at the amount of Windams & Daggers they deployed after the Minerva.
   * Speaking of stupidity, Electronic Arts has become completely stupid. Like, after the world incident, they instantly try to launch a nuclear strike against the colonies. Of course it was stopped by ZAFT, but the fact that they quickly did that proves how utterly dumb EA has become. What's also stupid as fuck is Orb wanting to join the Earth Alliance. Whoever came up with this idea clearly needs a Gundam sized smack in the head. WHY IN GOD'S NAME WOULD YOU WANT TO SIDE WITH A GROUP OF GENOCIDAL XENOPHOBIC MANIACS? This anime is filled with people losing brain cells.
   * And ZAFT ain't off the hook either. Okay I'll say this, they're pretty compemdantt at the beginning with them handling the break the world incident and exposing the truth about the Earth Alliance. And then towards the end, they suddenly decide to unveil a plan called the Destiny Project, where it decides your future for you. And that sounds so stupid and I'm surprised that none of the civilians thought this idea was stupid to. Okay, the concept itself isn't a bad idea, it's the fact that it's into the last half of the show when it was about to wrap up. How easily were you shown by Captain America: The Winter Soldier of all things. But one plot point that never gets resolved is the “Break the World Incident”. This could've been interesting to see, a civil conflict in ZAFT where they are fighting against future & past ideals. But then, the anime forgot who was responsible for the break the world incident and everyone just blamed ZAFT for it, even though they tried to blow the fucking thing up.
   * No amount of words can express how much this anime fumbles with its world building. It keeps making you wonder how things got to the way they are. It really doesn't do the Cosmic Era any favors.
* Mobile Suits:
   * When I said the CE suits carried this series, it's especially true here. The plot, characters, and world building may be horse shit, but I would be lying if I said the mobile suits weren't the saving grace. These are some decent mobile suit designs and some well. Hell if anything, this anime is great for some mindless Mecha action if you hate the story that much. But there are some designs that I'm just not a fan of.
   * So starting off the main Gundam, the Impulse. It's an alight design I guess, but it has 2 of my Mecha pet peeves; needless combination gimmick & changing colors. The Impulse has a core fighter called the “Core Splenda” that combines with the chest, legs, & arms. It also changes colors depending on what pack it is. Not only does it make collecting those kits a nightmare, but also adds a gimmick that doesn't add too much. I already talked about this issue in my Victory Gundam, so I won't elaborate. It is smart however that it can regain energy from its ship via microwave beam. It's creative and is useful in battle.
   * And it has some decent toys too; by itself it just has vulcans, a beam shield, a beam rifle, and some knives. But when it combines with its Silhouette parks, that's when it gets its goodies.
      * The Force Silhouette park has a back booster with a pair of beam sabers.
      * The Sword Silhouette pack had 2x Excalibur Anti-Ship sword and 2x beam boomerangs.
      * And the Blast Silhouette pack has 2x cannons with missiles, 2x rail-guns, & 2x beam javelins (makes sense for a long range machine).
   * While these are some good weapons, I'm not gonna ignore the fact that this is just the Strike Gundam. They have the same gimmick & the silhouette packs serve the same purpose as the Striker Packs.
   * The Savior on the other hand isn't a rehash of the Aegis and has some differing traits as well. Outside of the usual stuff every MS has, there are also two kinds of cannons on top of each other, which are from Freedom and Justice. It could use these weapons in MA mode too that doesn't look like an ugly ass squid and instead a cool looking fighter plane. Now that's a glow up.
   * We do get more ZAFT exclusive Gundams (or more specifically the ones that weren't stolen) as we got the Destiny Gundam and Legend Gundam, both of which are pretty decent machines. The Destiny in particular actually looks good and has the equipment to boot. These include, but not limited to, a high energy long range beam cannon, a big ass beam sword, 2x beam palms that's mostly used for close combat opposed to it original use as a range weapon, 2x beam boomerangs, and standard crap these Gundams are to use. It also has beam wings, which is cool. As for the Legend Gundam, which is basically just a remaster of the Providence Gundam, but with 2x beam javelins, no mega man arm, and a big ass sword. So not too much.
   * Now let's go to Grand Theft Gundam and check out the stolen goods. It ain't a SEED show if we don't have some stolen Gundams, and this show got 'em in spades. Starting off with the Chaos Gundam, it's a pretty interesting machine with a good looking MA mode. It has about the same Weapons as the Blast Impulse, along with some beam sabers, beam claws, and a couple of machine guns. And the transforming Gundams don't end there, as the rest of them are good as well.
   * The Abyss Gundam has cannons for days, some torpedoes, CIWS guns, and a good ol beam lance. It can also transform for some aquatic action.
   * And finally there's the Gaia Gundam, which is one of my favorite machines. I like some black Gundams, what can I say. It has a couple CIWS guns, 2x beam sabers, 2x beam cannons, and beam blades on its wings. It can also transform into a dog, need I say more? It's such a shame that EA didn't incorporate their tech into their other mobile suits, but whatever.
   * Now on to the other stolen Gundams that weren't used by a group of xenophobes. While the Freedom did make a return, it's the Strike Freedom along with the Infinite Justice where it's at. The former being a sight for sore eyes. The gold really does add a lot to the angelic aesthetic. It also has about the same equipment, but this time it has a beam shield, 2x beam rifles that can combine into one, a belly button cannon, and of course DRAGOONS. Now this thing is a beast. As for the Infinite Justice, it's about the same as the original Justice in both looks and equipment, but now with blades on its legs & wings. Lacus always knows what to steal for her 2 boys.
   * The next 2 new Gundams remain on their respective sides, but they also lead to 2 plot points that definitely ruins the anime. The Destroy Gundam, a Psycho Gundam copycat that can also turn into a copycat of the Big Zam with a metric shit ton of beams and dragoons. And yet it lead to both Shinn and Kira to lose a bunch a of brain cells, as one tries to protect someone who's trying to kill a bunch of innocent people in a defenseless town, as for the other, despite know for EFFORTLESS DISARMING MOBILE SUITS WITHOUT KILLING THE PILOTS, decides to kill this one. All I can say is these 2 things;
      * 1.) This scene would work INFINITELY BETTER if Kira was replaced with Athrun and
      * 2.) Unicorn did it better.
   * As for the Akatsuki, don't get me wrong it's a cool looking suit, with its reflective golden armor, funnels, and all, but for god sakes it's as much as wasted potential as Cagalli's involvement in the story. She only uses the thing twice & that's it, letting Mu use it towards the end. These 2 Gundams are cool & all, but CHRIST did lead to the worst plot points in the anime.
   * At least there's some returning Gundams, namely the Strike Rouge & Freedom. The Latter is largely the same, so I won't go into detail. As former, while having the same weapons, it does have a new Striker Pack, the Ootori striker pack. Equipped with the Beam Launcher, a big ass sword with beam edge, some railguns, and a metric shit ton of missiles. It's also interesting to see if it changes from its pink color scheme to the original scheme once Kira uses it for a bit.
   * This may be a lot, but these are just the Gundams. We still got the ZAFT MSs, which is already over a handful. We already got the CGUE, Dinn, BuCUE, G00hn, & Zn0 do return along with a now variant of the GuAIZ called the GuAIZ R with a pair railguns add to it's arsenal this time. As for the new machines, we got the transforming BABI with missiles and 2x kinds of rifles, the tank GAZu00T with missiles & cannons, the aquatic ASH with missiles, beams, & claws and the Geo G00hN being a modified G00hN.
   * And then ZAFT grow a hard on for zeonic designs and basically brought into the CE. There are 3, count em, THREE ZEONIC DESIGNS. Starting of with the ZAKU Warrior (coming with a beam shield, tomahawk, hand grenades, beam assault rifle, heavy assault machine gun, recoilless cannon, & Heavy) which is basically just a Zaku with multiple Striker Packs….I mean “Wizard Packs”;
      * Gunner ZAKU (Beam Cannon)
      * K Slash ZAKU (back Gatling guns)
      * Blaze ZAKU Warrior (Missiles)
      * and the ZAKU phantom (2 spikey Shields).
   * these looks slightly different than the og, so I'll give it that. There's also one for “Lacus”, but it doesn't do a damn thing so I won't count it.
   * Next is the GOUF Ignited with about the same load out of the original; Heat rod & wrist mounted 3-barreled gun. It also has a double beam bladed sword (seriously what the hell is with the Cosmic Era and beam edged swords? Is it even that different from a regular beam saber or a more powerful beam saber).
   * And finally, there's the DOM Trooper (technically it's Terminal’s mobile suit, but since it was made by ZAFT, it still counts). Again, same equipment with a CE twist (a big Bazooka and an actual beam saber instead of the usual heat saber), but now it has a beam shield & the “Screaming Nimbus” (aka the super star from Mario). I don't have too much about these 3, they're just like the original, but SEED-ified. One thing that both the UC & CE make a constant, any side associated with any regime starting with a “Z” will always have a lot of mobile suits with mono eyes to make the fan boys ignore their war crimes.
   * Speaking of war crimes, let's talk about EFF’s much more fucked up twin, EA and their mobile suits. While VERY little compared to ZAFT, these 4 suits still deserve some love. Starting off with a MSV suit that FINALLY made an appetite, the Dagger (or as some call it, the 105 Dagger). It was originally made to be the 1st mass produced mobile suit for the Earth Alliance, but was too expensive. It's basically a more stripped down version of the Strike, but still retains the ability to switch Striker Packs. Outside of some equipment from both the Strike Dagger & Striker Packs, it also has a machine gun & beam carbine, which is just a semi auto beam pistol.
   * Next is its more successful descendant, the Dagger L. It keeps it's ability to switch Striker Packs AND it's cheap to produce. It has the same stuff, CIWS guns, foot machine guns, 2x hipped beam sabers, a shield, the aforementioned beam carbine, some exploding Kunais and now a bazooka like recoilless cannon.
   * And finally there's the Windam, the apex of OMNI’s engineering. Similar weapons to the previous 2 units, but now has a more long & curvy rifle and a bladed shield with some missiles. And it doesn't end there, outside of being able to use the original Striker Packs, it has 3 new packs that the Dagger L can also use.
      * The Jet Striker Pack with a lot of missiles on the wings
      * the Doppelhorn Striker Pack for 2x cannons
      * the Multi-Striker Pack to nuke your enemies to oblivion
   * With all this might and mechanical superiority, they were ready to….get their ass kicked multiple time to show off ZAFT's plot armor. Not even Neer’s Custom Windam managed to keep up.
   * There's also the Forbidden Vortex (being a cheap version of the original Vortex), Zamza-Zah, & Gells-Ghe (both being mobile armors), but they're not as memorable as the previous suits. EA may be some idiotic xenophobes, but they upped their MS game hard.
   * Finally, there's ORB. Outside of the returning M1 Astray, all we got is the Murasame. It's basically just a transforming Astray with missiles & vulcans for days. It has a beam gun on its tail wing too. And in case you're gonna ask, the Murasame, M1 Astray, and Forbidden Vortex are as much Gundams as the Hazels are Gundams (only true Gundam fans will understand that reference).
   * So that's every single mobile suit I've cared to count in this damn anime. These are just the ones that appeared on screen, and I haven't even talked about the MSVs. All I can say is that these designs sure as hell made the anime more enjoyable than it has any right to be. Doesn't stop it from being a dumpster fire though.
* Verdict:
   * The TL;DR of this anime is, it truly sucked. Poorly structured plot, nearly all of the characters aren't likable in the slightest, and near to nothing to the Cosmic Era. The only redeeming factor is the Mecha fights, that and the music is pretty (except the last 2 openings, those sucked). I think the worst thing about this anime is that it just retreads story beats from SEED. And I think that's when a sequel fails when it repeats what its predecessor did. It just reminds us how much better the original is. And to add insult, like Fairy Dance to SAO, Destiny made the Cosmic Era look bad in the public when in reality it wasn't as bad. If Destiny focused on telling an original story, expanding on the original cast, either nutter or improving the new characters, adding more to the Cosmic Era, and making the grunts less pathetic to service the main characters, THEN we'll probably have a good follow up to SEED. But instead, it joins IBO season 2, Build Fighters Try, & ZZ as my least favorite follow ups to a Gundam series. It is truly sad that it ended up like this.",False,anime,1707763017.0,1ap77w9,Writing

SLF had no need to go so hard while solo leveling is being so mid. But they did.,"Disclaimer: Solo Leveling manwha is one of my favorite, but.

Shangri-La Frontier is a way better anime than Solo Leveling is right now and may ever be.

Did you watch Shangri-La Frontier episode 18 ??? It aired yesterday, same week as Solo Leveling episode 6.

What the hell ?? There was no one drinking coffee mid-fight, no flashback interrupting important scenes, no unrelated training sequence in between two attacks and the animation was top tier ???

So you are saying this was possible all this time ?

A-1 really did us dirty with the pacing of Solo Leveling it should have been incredible it is just the middest of mid animes and the only redeeming quality it has is the **C H I N** and Sawano's genius.

Vinland Saga honest thoughts so far,"I'm 9 episodes in, and... I don't understand the hype.

Series started out ok, but given that this series is supposed to be a ""realistic"" seinen, it seems like this series still suffers with one and a half dimensional characters who feel like they were ripped out of a battle shonen and stuck in a slightly edgier setting. 

Thors is written to pull a complete 180 and become a pacifist  in basically an instant, no time given to develop that change in his attitude towards war. And his character afterwards is basically Jesus.

Thorfinn is basically your typical angsty broody overpowered protagonist with one very simplistic goal and nothing else. The only thing keeping me watching is his dynamic with Askellad, who is actually an ok character so far. I don't know where Thorfinn's character development is going to go, but if he becomes the exact same person as ~~Jesus~~ Thors, I'll be frustrated.

Does anyone else feel the same way about (early) Vinland Saga? Does it get better?",False,anime,1707748652.0,1ap1fut,Discussion

Anime with Travolta and Thurman dance scene from Pulp Fiction,"I've tried asking in the daily thread and yield no result. I've also tried googling and looking at youtube, but also yield no result.

Several weeks ago I watched this scene either on OP or ED of an anime. I slightly remember that the OP/ED also referenced other pop culture (I think the theme is MC as an actress?).

I believe this is from a recent anime. However, for the love of God, I couldn't find it in any of my current watch list that it's driving me crazy

For those who doesn't know the scene that I mentioned, please see this short clip.

Romance anime where the protagonist is a gigachad instead of a shy mess?,"I've started to get sick of this trope of these cringe ass protagonists that lose their minds when a girl touches them for 0.4 nanoseconds. I want some anime where the protagonist has balls, and there is a clear and convincing reason for the other party to like them as opposed to blatant wish fulfillment of pretty girl likes loser guy.

Some good examples of what I'm looking for are Sakuta from BGS and the council president from Tsuredure Children.

And if I were to specify a border it would be between Gojo from Dress up Darling and Tomoya from Saekano. 

In Gojo's case the reason is there and he isn't a loser, but he's still shy and self conscious around Marin so he fails, whereas Tomoya, who as an otaku would be labeled a (self-proclaimed) loser, has some impressive displays of audacity, so he gets a pass.

With all that said, any suggestions?",False,anime,1707743962.0,1aozudp,What to Watch?

I've been playing video/computer games for 20 years and I still don't know what 'game' all these isekai worlds are based on.,"There are THOUSANDS of interesting fantasy and sci-fi worlds that exist in gaming media. All of them have a semblance of world building, some even containing original or bespoke elements. Similarly, although fantasy fiction lays itself on the shoulders of literary icons like Tolkien or Moorcock; every author still tries to make their worlds interesting. And the ones that are 'generic' generally don't become popular enough to get exported to Japan.

Wizardry isn't even the most popular RPG system. It's Call of Cthulhu.

And the legacy of Wizardry (Dragon Quest, Granblue, Final Fantasy and a few others) have all evolved to have uniquely deep fantasy worlds.

And if we are to talk about gaming media in Japan; year after year, the most popular games in Japan are:   
For consoles: Pokemon, Mario, Zelda, Fire Emblem, Monster Hunter;   


For PC: FPS games like Apex, Valorant or co-op survival types (if we go off the Steam store).

Absolutely NONE of the popular media that exists in Japan seems to correlate to 'generic' fantasy. But for some fucking reason, every isekai world is almost identical to another, based on some kind of fantasy media that I can't even fathom.

Why are anime Blu-rays so expensive?,"With the whole crunchyroll funimation merge thing recently I've been looking more into anime blu-ray sets as I generally enjoy owning physical media and thought this could be a pretty good time to look into getting anime physically.

Jojo's in total is also over £200 total. Egregious.

I've known for a while that they were all pretty expensive but I've never really questioned why. Is there a reason? Surely they aren't this expensive in Japan? I've checked out a bunch of other serie's prices and they're all ridiculous, even very very short series have prices well over £250...

Funimation and physical copies,"Since Funimation is shutting down or fully merging with Crunchyroll. Does this mean we won’t be getting physical anime anymore?

Why aren't Sentai's anime licenses releasing on Bluray in Australia any more?,"I recently noticed several Sentai-licensed anime I was interested in buying never seemed to get Australian Bluray release dates. After [inquiring with customer support](https://i.imgur.com/pslVl2D.png) provided no clear answer, I resorted to checking every single Sentai monthly slate for local releases until I found one.

The last one I could find was Rent A Girlfriend Season 1, which released **nearly two years ago in May 2022** (Dec 2021 in the US). 

Preceding that was DanMachi Season 3 (Mar '22/Dec '21), Vinland Saga (Nov '21/Aug '21), and Dororo (Oct '21/Jun '21).

**Not a single title released after December 2021 according the US release slates has ever been released physically in Australia.** This includes some popular titles such as Made in Abyss S2, Ya Boy Kongming, Call of the Night, and Clannad. Accordingly, this also applies to upcoming releases.

I note that the AU distributor market has changed a lot in recent years, with Madman being bought up and converted to Crunchyroll AU (RIP Animelab), and both Hanabee and Siren Visual, who often released Sentai titles in the past, seemingly going out of business some time ago. 

Still though, it seems a bit rude to just totally exclude us from home video release. What gives?

For reference, every title I checked is below. It's fairly likely that there are some from even before that which didn't get released in Australia either.

How to sell a fight scene (Comparing JJK and Ninja Kamui),"I won't make this super analytical, but I just wanted to gush over Ninja Kamui's pilot episode really quick and spout some late AM incoherent thoughts before I hit the bed.

With Ninja Kamui right off the bat the general animation and choreography were fantastic in this episode and hopefully keeps the same level of quality, but the element that really sells the fight scenes in this episode is the utilization of the art of knowing when to shut the fuck up.

The biggest sin of this for me in JJK S2 was the very beginning of the Yuji vs Mahito fight. Every time I watch the clip of Nanami going through this beautiful send off and then going into the stellar voice work between Mahito and Yuji's VAs for it all to get squandered by this, for the lack of a better phrase, dog shit music to start playing completely breaks me out of the emotional build up the viewer just went on for the last five minutes. It's so incredibly disappointing.

I look back at my unenjoyment of JJK S2 and disregarding the common critiques you've already heard, I just think JJK's music choice overall doesn't sell the mood they're trying to go for most of the time and ends up working against the anime more than helping it, even though it's a pretty good OST. The only time I can recall them nailing the music with the scene's context was Gojo's ""I alone am the honored one"" scene.

Now, compare this to Ninja Kamui and the usage of the soundtrack, or really the lack of it, is a night and day difference to how effective it makes a fight scene. Being able to hear the impact of every last hit and movement that could be, or is a fatal blow is so much more effective to selling the hell out of a fight and making it that much more engaging. Also just want to say this isn't at all a new thing either. Some of the best fights just know the subtle art of just being quiet. Naruto is a master class of this.

And of course it all comes down to the genre, difference in tone, and viewer preference (for example I think the MHA's OST absolutely make the fights in that anime that much more incredible), but I think the comparison and critique between these two are fairly apt in that both anime are in that same ""bloody fight fest with good visuals"" market.

Any JJK fans that have HBO Max, I highly recommend giving this first episode a watch. Seems to be really promising, albeit a pretty basic plot setup.",False,anime,1707718476.0,1aotbym,Discussion

"According to this isekai/fantasy world classification, any prime example pip up for each category?","https://i.redd.it/lnzs69jpe2ic1.jpeg


It's chart for isekai person rescue urgency but I decide to add to use for fantasy world as well.

I'll start.



Fairytale world:

- Konosuba (watch S1) Kazuma's adventures tone make me feel like everything's easy and not so serious.

- Farming in another world (anime): gotta keep the harem expanding



Heroic world:

- SAO (Ln) Aincrad world

- Slime (S3) seems like threat are very small to Tempest with Rimuru around (i think if you
remove Rimuru, Tempest would be Glided world)

- Dr.Stone (S3 part 1) The threat are just world ending phenomenon, other seem not too bad.



Noblebright world:

- Mushoku tensei (Ln reader); pretty much standard medieval time or our world + magic.

- Frieren (manga) should be here or near borderline Glided world.

- Solo leveling (Manhwa): could be glided world if not based on world modern world.

- Code geass??



Glided world:

- AoT: Pretty much prime example of Gilded world

- The Eminence in shadow (Ln): imagine being an average guy, isekaied to be an average man there. Diablo shit, the cult, shadow garden raid and wrecking havoc.

- Berserk (Manga): Also borderline Grimdark world, if u happen to be in the crossfire city. 

- Overlord (S4): The world itself seem Glided to me but if u got isekai to Nazaric's enemy is pretty much Grimdark for you.

- Re:Zero (S2)

- Shield Hero (S2)



Grimdark world: no idea, i haven't watch too many dark fantasy anime.

Announcing the First Ever /r/anime Trivia Contest!,"Welcome back to another edition of the /r/anime Sweet 16/9mil/Awards Extravaganza! I'm excited to announce this particular event because I think it's pretty ambitious and unlike anything that we've really done before.

Sometimes I wonder, why does the anime community put so much effort into recording their watching activity? Out of other communities based around media, I feel like we're the ones that can choose from like twenty different tracking sites—as well as the ones who memorize obscure background songs to get the upper hand. Then it occurred to me, we must love random minutia! Why else would we meticulously score and categorize what we've seen, making it almost a hobby into itself?! We're simply building up trivia knowledge! (Please forgive the overwrought entirely transparent attempt at a lead-in intro).

What clan does Megumin belong to? Why is Mune Oomune's name a pun? Just how many Super Saiyan forms are there?! Come join us to answer these questions and more, and **win a fabulous prize!** 

#Participation Details

The trivia contest will be hosted 6 days from now, on **February 17th, 2024 at 1200 PM Central Time, 1800 UTC**. This will be a **live** event! We will be using [Blooket](https://www.blooket.com/) in order to deliver questions and process answers, and the entire thing will be streamed [on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/Dr_JWilson). You don't necessarily have to tune into the Twitch stream, but you'll be able to see how you're doing on each question compared to your fellow trivia players, and most importantly... be able to  [**trash talk in chat.**](#trololol).  

&nbsp;

Also, if you couldn't make it into the lobby, we still encourage you to play along—that also goes for people who missed the event entirely and watch the VOD!

Blooket handles up to 300 players, which hopefully is more than enough. It'll be a first-come, first-served basis, and we'll start promptly on time with however many players were able to join. **You must use your Reddit username as your nickname**. This will be used to validate account requirements as well as be the final delivery means for prizes. And of course, **you may not cheat**, either by looking up the answers, discussing the questions with others, or impersonating someone else. Any evidence of this is grounds for immediate disqualification and potentially a ban from the subreddit. Let's keep this clean and fun!

Once again, the trivia contest will be hosted one week from now, on February 17th, 2024 at 1200PM Central Time, 1800 UTC. Another post will go up the day of to remind people to join for a chance to win some great prizes!

#Prizes

How can we afford prizes you ask?

##[We've got Reddit money](https://files.catbox.moe/1vwh05.png). 
[](#shutupandtakemymoney)

The Reddit Community Funds program has afforded us the opportunity to experiment and try new ways to keep the subreddit fun and give back to the community. If this goes well and people have a good time, we hope to do this again!

First place winner, the one who successfully conquers the gauntlet of arcane and mostly useless (sorry) trivia knowledge, will receive a **$100 [Sentai Filmworks](https://www.sentaifilmworks.com/) Gift Card.** You could spend it immediately, but Sentai often has absurd sales, so you could get quite a lot of bang for your buck!

[](#seasonalhype)

Second place runner-up will receive a **year subscription of Crunchyroll Premium**! Crunchyroll has a great catalogue of shows and a number of good pick-ups from season to season. A year subscription is an $80 value that could free that money up for other anime endeavors!

#Eligibility

Now for a bit of disappointing news. Since these prizes are funded through Reddit, there are certain regional restrictions. Namely, in order to be eligible for prizes, you must be a legal resident of **the United States of America, the United Kingdom, or Canada (excluding Quebec)**. You must also meet /r/anime's new account restrictions, namely **be an account older than 8 days and have more than 10 karma**. You must not be banned from /r/anime (duh!) and must be in good standing with the community.

***

That's it! Once again we thank Reddit for giving us this opportunity, and I thank you guys in advance for showing up and having a good time with me. I'll be hosting over at https://twitch.tv/Dr_JWilson on **Saturday, February 17th at 1200 PM Central Time, 1800 UTC**. Whether or not you're one of the lucky (or should I say, skilled?) ones to win a prize, I'm just happy to be hanging out with the community and putting on a fun little event. See you there!",False,anime,1707700754.0,1aoo0w1,*Live* event on Saturday!

Outlaw Star - Anime of the Week,"Welcome to the weekly Anime of the Week Discussion Thread! Each week, we're here to discuss various older anime series. Today we are discussing...

## Outlaw Star

Gene Starwind has always dreamed of piloting his own ship out into the vast sea of stars. Unfortunately, not all dreams come true, as he spends his days working odd jobs alongside his partner, James Hawking, on the small planet Sentinel III instead. However, this all takes a turn when the duo takes on a job from Rachel Sweet who, unbeknownst to them, is actually a treasure-hunting outlaw.

What are some good animes to watch?,"I've already watched JJK, Demon Slayer, AOT and Gate(1 and 2), plus several other animes, but I can't remember the names as it's been a minute.

I'm currently watching One Piece and Solo leveling but I've gotten bored of watching One Piece(mostly bc of the arc I'm in but I dont want to skip it) and Solo Leveling only releases a new episode every 6-7 days so I need some new things to watch.

I typically like shounen, action, adventure, and some Isekai.

Sorry for the extensive yapping session but I quite literally do not know what else to watch rn😅",False,anime,1707695401.0,1aom9cp,What to Watch?
Will there be a chess episode in Classroom of the Elite Season 3?,"This is a question I wanted to share because chess and anime is the greatest idea for entertainment, and love chess as much as anime comes to mind. So hopefully this will be a discussion everyone will ponder about. So let's get started. 

If you don't know what Classroom of the Elite is, Classroom of the Elite sets in a senior a high school following with a character by the name of Kiyotaka Ayanokoji. Don't want to try to spoil much of the anime story for those who don't watch it. If you haven't watch it already, I highly recommend you watch as it gets interesting and interesting in every episode.

In an episode of the first season of the anime, Arisu Sakayanagi was playing chess by herself in the school library. She was playing a chess position that seems to be a master game. During the scene, Arisu is holding a chess book while doing a mate in 4. Now that could hint some major things about a chess episode but want to show you some other things about Season 3.

The opening of Classroom of the Elite Season 3 was heavily showing chess pieces and chess notations. It made me think there could be a chess episode in the anime, but it could go hand-in-hand what the opening is entailing. The opening was also showing shogi pieces and playing cards so maybe the animne won't be deliberately be about chess but other board games as well.

Tell me what you think of this discussion. gladly hear your thoughts about this.",False,anime,1707695185.0,1aom6t5,Help

Any chill anime recommendation to watch?,"So as i get older i feel like i'm no longer inventes on those animes that feature tons of action or a force romance. I can withstand the harem situation and maybe some ecchi but just so little.

Recently i ended (for the second time) Isekai Nonbiri Nouka, which (for those who don't know it) is ofc an isekai but based on how god made a mistake and gave an innocent person a life that a criminal should deserve. He gives him a second chance to start from dust on a new world (with some help) and his choice is to be a farmer. That's the plot, the guy makes a town and farms. The town progresses with new citizens and many things.

I loved it so much bc ther is no unnecesary drama, not much of fight scenes or epic momments that feel too much, not a force romance at all. That's what i want, a chill anime to relax to like Isekai Nonbiri Nouka. Is there anything out there that's like it? I already watched the slime one (rimuru the slime) and i liked it but soon it took a strange turn so, any idea on what would be something that chill to watch?",False,anime,1707694799.0,1aom22h,What to Watch?

ANSWER TODAY’S QUESTION(S)

What are your thoughts on gossiping? Are you for it, or against it, and why?

Why do you think Shonen Bat decided to attack Kamohara's husband?

Bonus) You would think Kamohara would stop hanging out with her friends given they treat her like crap.

**Questions for post series discussion:**

Q1 - What was your favourite aspect of Gintama? Characters? Comedy? All of it?

Q2 - What do you do at the end of the rewatch? Are you busy? Will you save me?

Q3 - Since it took 10 years between the last successful Gintama Rewatch and this one, what is something you'd like to say to either the host or the watchers of the next one in 2034?

Q4A - **FOR FIRST TIMERS** \- When did you realize that this show had an over-arching plot developing alongside all the jokes and which episode was ""The one"" that made you go, ""that's it, I'll watch it 'till the end""?

Q4B - **FOR REWATCHERS** \- How did it feel watching the series with all the previous knowledge of the plot and watch the characters interactions develop?

Q5 - Without taking in consideration the existence of overarching story of Gintama that existence was a secret revealed in later arcs, how would you expect the Gintama to end if Gintama was only 100% toilet humor/slapstick/gag humour and other aspects of low comedy?

Q6A - How would you murder your rewatch host?

Q6B - What's your favourite shitpost from the show or rewatch?

Q7 - Are there any other rewatches you will be joining?

Q8 - What character did you change your opinion on the most over the course of the series and how?

Q9 - Did any of the many anime references in Gintama made you more interested in watching the referenced show?

Q10 - Gintama has a unique form of storytelling, where there is alot of episodic, unconnected episodes, with the serious arcs sprinkled in between. its not until later where we get more serious arc instead of episodic, comedy and meta episodes. So overall did this format work for you? Did the comedy always land? and was it ever a chore to get through?

Q11 - Did you have a favorite running gag? If so, what was it?

"What Have You Watched This Past Week That is NOT a Currently Airing Show? [February 11th, 2024]","Title says it all - talk about the anime you watched this past week that are not a part of this Winter 2024 season (like **Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun 2nd Stage** or **Dungeon Meshi**), or a show that's continuing from previous seasons (like **Sousou no Frieren**).

With regards to Fall 2023 shows, however, it would be fine to write about them as long as you only began them after they finished airing. For example, it's fine to talk about watching **The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You** or **Arknights: Perish in Frost** if you started them after the final episode aired. Obviously, use your best judgement on this.

**Please use spoiler tags**; it's super simple stuff. An example below:

        [KonoSuba Ep 9] >!""THIS WAS A VERY BAD EPISODE, DARKNESS DID NOT DESERVE THAT!<

What anime would make the BEST IRL adaptation?,"A few days ago I made a post asking what would make the worst/most hilarious live adaptation, but a lot of people said that most if not all anime would be pretty bad. So I guess a better question is if most are unfit for live action, then what *would* make a good one? I’m thinking maybe something like Vinland saga, maybe even parasyte. Of course those shows could definitely be done bad if not close to form. I think the cowboy bebop live version could have been good but they just missed the mark in the directing that it just did not work and wasn’t close to the original at all.",False,anime,1707677920.0,1aofhdd,Discussion

Would you rather a second season we never get or one you wish we never got...,"I'd say take a shot every time the list of the most anticipated anime of a new season is dominated by sequels, but that's really just a reminder to feed into my alcoholism every three months.

The last few years has admittedly been a pretty good time to be a fan of older series, with many once dormant series coming back with new sequels, spinoffs, or remakes (*Full Metal Panic, Kimi ni Todoke, Fruits Basket, Spice and Wolf, Blue Exorcist, Trigun, Urusei Yatsura*, etc.). Us fans rejoice over these announcements with the hope that we can relive those warm nostalgic memories and use it as a spring board for new fans to pick up the series we love, but it really isn't all sunshine and rainbows? Sure, we all have our *Land of the Lustrous*' and *No Game No Life*'s that make us go ""man, it sure sucks that they never got a second season"" but we also have our *The Devil is a Part-timer*'s and *One Punch Man*'s that make us go ""*man*, it sure sucks that we never got a second season"".

Let's be real here. There's nothing worse than a sucky sequel, and history is peppered with franchises that were the talk of the town before an underwhelming to outright bad sequel came to take the wind out of their sales. In probably the most prominent example, *The Promised Neverland* used to be *the* rising Shounen title before that second season made it the laughing stock of the community. 

So that brings us to the question at hand. Would you rather a series never get that sequel you always wanted or for that sequel to come and ruin everything? Would you rather your lasting memory of a show be that of a fun time that just never had the time to get off the ground or a recommendation that you always have to plop an asterisk and a joke about a non-existent second season next to? Lastly to generalize, can a sequel be so bad that it retroactively affects your enjoyment of that first season? When, for an applicably unfinished series, is it better for the legacy of that series to end it after one season instead of chancing a second?",False,anime,1707676591.0,1aoeyn6,Discussion

Anime recommendations for a newbie who does not like stereotypical anime-like women,"  Hey everyone! In late October 2023, I started my adventure with anime. Before that, I'd seen only a few animated, Japanese movies. I really like animated stuff and want much more recommendations for the following years; however, there is one thing I can't stand in anime - stereotypical anime women.  
So, the anime I am looking for should:

* have as few anime girls as possible (normal female characters are more than welcome),
* be the least sexist possible (Steins;gate was too much for me),
* have as few ""male gaze"" scenes as possible. If I want to watch boobs, asses or legs, I can go outside or visit xvideos,
* tell engaging, interesting, emotional stories,
* follow the quality over quantity principle,
* bonus points for: fantasy/science fiction, gore, mature themes, depressing or anxiety-inducing scenes,
* a special bonus for it being seinen genre (do you even call it a genre) - I don't like stories that are too childish.

What I have already seen (besides movies):

* Death Note - 7/10 (quality dropped af after the 2/3 of the anime)
* Berserk 1997 - 9+/10 (almost perfect; I'll be reading manga soon)
* Vinland Saga - 8/10
* Steins;gate - 7/10 (was really emotional but too animesque and I really hated the way they treated women characters)
* Neon Genesis Evangelion - 6/10 (I get the metaphors, but again, the female characters were meh and it was too odd)
* Darker Than Black - 6/10 (villain of the week story didn't feel right, and it had a lot of wasted potential)
* Serial Experiments Lain - 9/10 (awesome philosophical, cyberpunk anime, loved it)
* Erased - 9/10 (it was like this American novel ""Boy's Life"" by Robert McCammon, a bit dumb but nostalgic and emotional)

Also, I've seen thousands of mainstream films. As I am about to finish my film knowledge studies, I already have a bachelor's. I know a lot about film, so I like to enjoy the technical and narrative sides of anime as well, even if the story lacks something. :)  
Thank you for all the recommendations, and have a nice day or night!  ",False,anime,1707667473.0,1aobbn5,What to Watch?

Need Help Remembering an Anime Music Video,"Hey guys. I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this but I'll ask anyway.

I remember an anime-style music video similar to the concept of a whisker away. When the trailer for A Whisker Away came up I remembered that video but no matter how hard I tried I could not find it. 

This is what I remember but it could be different since it was a while back. There was a cat who was in love with a boy who was kind to her. She asked the kami-sama to let her be a human to be with the boy. She was eventually made into a girl but she was not allowed to touch the boy. The boy eventually almost got into an accident but was saved by the girl (cat), where she eventually turned into a cat again in front of the boy.

Greatly appreciate it if someone could help me with this one. It's been on and off in my mind since 2020 and I just want answers. Thank you Redditors.

86 is the first anime I've gotten into for a while,"Really great show.  Just the right amount of action, character and world building.   Maybe it's because it's been a while since I watched anime (I go through phases of complete burnout on the medium/genre whatever after a while) but after finishing both seasons I can say it's a really solid show.  I'm surprised I don't hear more about it.  Maybe I just missed its point in the spotlight and don't know.  

I did watch the dub, which I know is a sin to some people but it was really good and I'm also upset to hear the VA for Shin passed away from cancer at 35.  That's really sad.  RIP dude.

Did this show get a lot of attention when it aired?  I don't think i was watching a lot of shows at the time and may have just missed it.  It's better than anything new I've tried to watch.",False,anime,1707664083.0,1aoa10s,Discussion

Any standard and decent fantasy adventure anime/manga/light novel,"
Do you guys know any ""normal"" fantasy anime that's just fun?
Like something that doesn't have overpowered mc's or harems or something like ""the protagonist is the chosen one bla bla"" or random things that the author does that don't have any relevancy to the plot? Just to drag the story out? 
I'm just asking if you guys know just a simple and short story (preferably long though) like the protagonist decides to go on an adventure or quest just cause.

And the story isn't something like the world revolves around the protagonist, what I'm asking for is something like we're just watching the life of someone who lives in this world. You guys know what I mean?

"Lu Over The Wall (2017) is underrated, imo.","I just saw it today and I really liked it. I'd like to start with its negatives: although I like how fast-paced it was, at times it was teetering to chaotic. The story overall wasn't that particularly amazing, you could say it was just simple, nothing deep, life-changing, or compelling. There were also some several plotholes and stuff. The ending felt really too abrupt. Many of the characters, although I liked some of them, were ultimately just meh. I wanted more stuff about the mer-people but the movie was being quite scant about it.

Despite those, I did not regret watching it at all. The animation style is really dynamic and funky. I really like the dream-like/surreal and childish animation sequences. The first few minutes made me think the animation was gonna be ""slice-of-lifey"" but no, it was actually quite cartoony. The characters would move animatedly and expressively. The use of colors were pleasing to the eyes. I also liked its comedy. The soundtracks were really good, energetic, lively, and in some parts, beautiful (like that scene with the grandpa near the end, you'll know what I meant after you watch it). I also really liked the transition into its title card.

Overall, I think it's a movie that despite its destination and flaws, you might enjoy the journey like I did. It's been a while since an anime movie made me feel this awed and captivated like a child.

If I were to list what I disliked about it the most it would be (1) those plotholes about the missing people, (2) the lore of the curse, and (3) the abrupt and bittersweet ending, which personally felt it had more bitter than sweet. Although I guess I should've expected that sort of ending from the director of ""Devilman Crybaby"" and ""Ride your Wave"" T T",False,anime,1707652824.0,1ao6evd,Discussion

Older anime fans: what is the biggest difference between the anime community now compared to when you were young?,"For me I'd say it's the modern devotion to seasonal anime.

I got into anime in the 2000s, and I don't think I'd heard the term ""seasonal anime"" until the mid 2010's. In the 2000s I only knew about a new anime when a licensor or fansub group told me it existed, and from my perspective it wasn't happening in well-defined seasons.

In retrospect it's clear that if anime came out in Japan seasonally then the localizations must have been seasonal-with-lag, but it wasn't being marketed in that context. A new anime was just a mysterious product put in front of my face whenever a distributor felt like it.

The closest thing to a ""seasonal"" anime was any random anime airing on TV. Like, new episodes of Bleach every Tuesday at midnight, after Futurama and Robot Chicken. New episodes of Chrno Crusade on this random premium cable channel I didn't know showed anime.

If a fansub group uploaded a new anime weekly I didn't think of it in terms of seasons. It was just a group of people sharing something they liked.

So since there were no seasons for online anime or DVD/VHS, there was no communal expectation to keep with with the latest shows. You would just watch whatever interested you and then seek out discussion groups of people who liked the same anime.

Nowadays I hear people talking about watching seasonal anime they don't even like, because keeping up with seasonals is a core part of anime community discourse. And all the big anime YouTubers make seasonal recap videos.

It's kind of amazing how the Western anime marketing teams have trained people to want to watch more anime by promoting their seasonal nature.",False,anime,1707641434.0,1ao3mtl,Discussion

Do you feel emotionally connected to Frieren?,"It’s an anime I enjoy plenty just like the rest of you. There is no denying it is incredibly made. The folks at Madhouse spared no expense in delivering a quality production. Evan (the goat) Call once again treats our ears with his composing. The vibes are nice and “chill” as one would describe, as well as melancholic. 

The main cast is likable and fun, but I have yet to say that I actually connect to them as  characters. And it’s hard to explain why that is.
I’m not sure if it’s simply the structure of the show being more on the slice of life side, or the fact that our trio has already gone through character development with either in flashbacks or off screen all together. 

There isn’t really much of stakes in universe yet. No one that can pose a challenge to the God that is Frieren, other than the spell granter who we’ve only seen very little of. Question to the source readers, Does the series get any “deeper” into Frieren, Fern, and Stark?

The only dubbed anime I have watched (besides like Pokémon or Yugioh when I was very young) was Yu Yu Hakusho. And while I do enjoy it very much, I have already re-watched it a few times over the years.

Subbed ones I have watched and enjoyed were Demon Slayer, Bleach, most of Naruto, Charlotte, Jujutsu Kaisen, Yona of the Dawn, some Fairytail, eh... blanking on other names cuz it's been a few years.

ANSWER TODAY’S QUESTION(S)

Have you ever had suicidal thoughts before? If so, how do you deal with them?

What do you make of the decision in this episode to not at all be about the mystery of who is Shonen Bat?

Bonus) Isn't it ironic that Zebra walks the zebra crossing given that the zebra crossing is straight? [](#chitogheh)

First anime to watch with girlfriend?,"Greetings, my long distance girlfriend will be at my apartment for the first time next Saturday and I am nervous as she kinda  knows I like anime but will see first hand how much of otaku I am. 

Anyways, she is 25, and I wanna watch an anime show or a film with her for I don't want to hide what I like, but don't want to put her off to it. She hasn't seen any before, but enjoys Avatar: the last airbender very much. Is there any other like that one? At worst I can fall back in a Ghibli film, but those are really kibd of their own genre and I dont want to deceive her like all anime is like that. Thanks for helping!

She likes ATLA, Percy Jackson, plays, theater shows, finer art type stuff, historical pieces

Edit: Your name I might watch, it being valentines day week and all. It works well. 

But I also want to show my sci-fi side as well. I think Metropolis is a relatively safe one to show. ",False,anime,1707594043.0,1anogug,What to Watch?

Can you recommend me shows like “The Apothecary Diaries” but with slightly more romance?,"Currently watching the show and I am adoring it! I really like the playful flirty relationship between Jinshi and Maomao). I’m looking for a similar vibe in an anime but is slightly more romantic and an actual slow burn with the main characters. Not sure if these two will actually end up together. I also liked how there is a large focus on story outside of their relationship so I’m wanting a show that has a combination of slow burn romance not as the main focus and an actual story outside of it. I do love the Sherlock mystery vibe and the art style as well along with the mixture of seriousness and comedy. 

Anyone know any shows like this?",False,anime,1707592478.0,1annvqf,What to Watch?

What are you guys favorite SHAFT works?,"Just wanted to have a discussion on the studio itself as lately I've been fascinated with their works as I recall like it was yesterday when I saw Madoka Madoka fansubbed in 2011, and while all I saw to this day was the original series, it was fascinating for its surprisingly dark nature as what started off a typical moe type anime got subverted hard after a certain point.

&#x200B;

Secondly I've noticed how their works can be a bit trippy at times as sometimes anime viewers in the USA for instance will say that the studio's works are done with copious amounts of LSD, but I don't know if that's true as drug usage is often prohibited in Japan, but to me it's fascinating how surreal the studio's works are though as yeah they can be trippy at times such as their adaptation of Monogatari itself.",False,anime,1707589112.0,1anmlz7,Discussion

I'd like to stop pirating anime. What streaming sites deserve my money?,"I've been watching anime for 10 years and never spent a single dime on it. I'm financially stable now so I figure i should start putting money back into my favorite pasttime instead of just leeching. But various official anime streaming sites have reputations for poor video players, or bad comment sections, or bad pricing, or simply taking too much cut of the revenue and not sending enough money back to the studios that make the shows. What sites really DESERVE my money? Or should I just contribute to one of those animator charity things instead of going thru the corporate layer?

Looking for anime to watch,"So basically im looking for high school anime to watch that is released before 2023. Im in my highschool phase. romance where the male character is really good looking like kakeru from glasslip is a plus. Or any romance anime where boy is lonely at first. I also dont mind dark psychological highschool animes like tomodachi game and another. 

Also i need help finding the anime ive been looking for. I suddenly dreamt it in my dream and felt like rewatching but i forgot the title. But i remember clearly 10 secs of the first episode and the main character. It starts off in the night. And then there is the main character who stands in the middle of something in the night. He has white greyish hair, blue jacket and a red scarf. Then his power has something to do with the scarf and there is blue flames. He looks like atsushi from bungo stray dogs except blue jacket and red scarf and probably whiter hair. 

Also theres another anime i want to remember. I think the male mc met the female mc in a game as their avatars. In real life, they are playing a game at separate places. And then they met in the real world and went to some academy? Their avatars look like chibis. Thank you!",False,anime,1707588001.0,1anm6o9,What to Watch?

But hey, queens deserve their crowns too, right? So put down your cursed tools, Jujutsu sorcerers, because it’s time to celebrate the fiercest, sassiest, and downright hottest girls who rock this cursed world!

## Hold My Sake, Boys, It’s the Girls’ Turn to Slay in Jujutsu Kaisen!

**Step aside, Gojo Satoru, it’s the girls’ turn to slay!** This week, we’re ranking the hottest Jujutsu Kaisen characters, from Nobara Kugisaki’s peculiar yet cool power to Maki Zenin’s stoic beauty. We’ll also dive into the enigmatic allure of Mei Mei, the sunshiney charm of Kasumi Miwa, and the hidden depths of Utahime Iori. So grab your sake and get ready to swoon, because these [Jujutsu Kaisen girls](https://www.yualexius.com/2024/02/hottest-jujutsu-kaisen-girls.html) are about to steal the show!

&#x200B;

**Leading the pack is Kugisaki Nobara**

Nobara isn’t just about the looks (though let’s be real, that ginger-brown hair and those sharp eyes are killer). This girl’s got the power to back up her sass. Straw dolls dancing at her command? Check. Cursing curses with a flick of her wrist? Double check. And don’t even get me started on her iconic “[straw doll technique of resonance](https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Straw_Doll_Technique#:~:text=Using%20Resonance%2C%20the%20user%20can,target%20to%20establish%20a%20connection.).” Nobara’s a force to be reckoned with, both on the battlefield and in the style department.

"When did the trend of ""redeeming the villainess"" get its start?","I know the more technical term is ""otome villainess"" but those tend to be specifically series where the protagonist is reincarnated as the villainess, while the trend I'm talking about is that plus series like *I'm in Love with the Villainess* and *Trapped in a Dating Sim*, where the villainess is a separate character from the protagonist but is shown in a more sympathetic light and that they're not truly that bad of a person.

I'm sure that technically these types of stories have always been around, but kind of like how kids fighting the death in arenas was a thing before *Hunger Games* but *Hunger Games* was the thing that every story after was trying to mimic the success of, given the increase in these types of villainess stories in anime (and assumedly light novels too) over the years I feel like there has to be a common denominator of some kind. Some story that really did something eye-catching with its villainess/villainess protagonist, or even some point in the media landscape where people started to feel the stock villainess character was being really underwritten or maybe even didn't deserve a lot of the terrible things they had happen to them in the standard stories.",False,anime,1707542293.0,1an8rzm,Discussion

Gunslinger Girl and Confronting the Posthuman,"When you think about the technology of the future, it’s hard not to feel a little excited about what’s coming. Reinforcing your limbs with an exoskeleton or accessing the Internet from your mind sounds empowering and convenient. And *Cyberpunk Edgerunners* last year was very cool too. But I don’t think anime is as excited as we are about that premise. Between the debilitating side effects of cybernetic enhancements in *Cyberpunk Edgerunners* and the fears of an AI uprising in *Vivy: Fluorite Eye’s Song*, we’re actually really afraid. There’s an overwhelming sense of concern in making that leap into the future - of abandoning humanity and embracing technology. What does it mean to step into the world of robotics and AI? What does it mean to move to the next stage after humans?

##What is posthumanism?

Posthumanism is far above my anime-addled mind’s capabilities to fully dive into within 3000 words. But in a general sense, posthumanism is a philosophy about challenging the definition of humans and human-centric mindsets. It’s an evolution of Humanism, a perspective that places [humanity at the top of everything else](https://imgur.com/mj1qWII.png). Posthumanism challenges that superiority by asking what separates a human and an android. Is a [person with prosthetic arms](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*6HgGbD6tbRSk-2TZWYGBIw.jpeg) still human? Is [an organic brain in a metal body](https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/ghost-in-the-shell-artwork.png?width=1200&height=630&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp) still human? Are [apes with 90% shared DNA human](https://i0.wp.com/news.qoo-app.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/11/17110808171769.jpeg)? This philosophical framework argues that, as technology rapidly advances, we need to do away with these definitions, break down these identity-based borders, and accept that “humanity” as we know it will and has fundamentally changed. Alongside this breakdown of boundaries, the destruction of taxonomies and other hierarchies is also core to posthumanism’s tenets of unifying all types of people.

This again is a bit of a gross oversimplification of posthumanism, but what I want to highlight about posthumanism and *Gunslinger Girl* is how we struggle with that transformation. We’ve all grown up with humans as the center of everything, and we have no idea what posthumans are because they have steadily crept up on us in the form of pacemakers or prosthetics. And sci-fi anime covering this topic emphasize that challenge to acknowledge this change in our society and thinking. Its characters grapple with their acceptance of cyborgs and AI, showing how we desperately cling to anthropocentrism. AI today is an incredibly controversial topic - are we willing to treat an AI the same way we treat our friends and family? Gunslinger Girl captures this anxiety, and shows the resulting brutality in its marginalization of the cyborgs. 

##Gunslinger Girl

*Spoilers for Season 1*

*Gunslinger Girl* sits in an interesting spot among science fiction anime. The story follows agents of Italy’s [Social Welfare Agency \(SWA\)](https://imgur.com/xQZuY59.png), a government-sponsored institution that provides rehabilitation services for [critically](https://imgur.com/77CQrMq.png) [injured](https://imgur.com/zoQKm2r.png) children. But it’s actually a front for a [counter-terrorism unit](https://imgur.com/2qVDtSA.png) that employs human, adult men handlers partnered with [brainwashed](https://imgur.com/AdWKmnN.png), [cybernetic girls](https://imgur.com/aQUxzAB.png) to [assassinate](https://imgur.com/Qp5fukI.png) everyone from bomb makers to political dissidents. *Gunslinger Girl* is set in modern (modern being early 2000s, same time as when the manga began publishing) Italy, where technology is advanced but not cyberpunk advanced. The cyborgs are noticeably anachronistic relative to the [other technology depicted](https://imgur.com/yTHC8RJ.png), but that only further emphasizes how novel posthumans are to the human cast members. 

These girls, who are either in [desperate situations medically or have been abandoned by their families](https://imgur.com/tvT7a55.png), undergo a procedure called “[conditioning](https://imgur.com/yVPp5PM.png),” that transforms them into cyborgs with [superhuman strength](https://imgur.com/t72aAIQ.png) and [reflexes](https://imgur.com/QXYAI7d.png). Conditioning has some drawbacks though: the first is that this process and subsequent procedures [shorten the lifespan of the patient](https://imgur.com/NXWDOIb.png). Another is that oftentimes the girls are programmed to possess an [unwavering loyalty towards their handlers](https://imgur.com/fNcBDUJ.png), to the point of [injuring innocent people](https://imgur.com/Af8n3g9.png) because they vaguely [point a knife](https://imgur.com/hTblAol.png) in their [handler’s direction](https://imgur.com/YSOpqd9.png). Lastly, the conditioning also wears away at their mental faculties, like [dementia](https://imgur.com/Y1RvSB6.png). The girls are paired with an adult male and form a unit called a fratello (Italian for sibling). The man is called a “handler,” and he gets to name his new [cyborg](https://imgur.com/NOOBY8j.png) and [teach her how to operate as an killer](https://imgur.com/0ry4epK.png). After injuries during missions, the girls are constantly re-conditioned at varying levels, further wearing down their lifespans and memories in order to squeeze out additional combat usefulness.

Season 1 focuses on the introduction of these girls and their relationships with their handlers. Despite being conditioned surgically to be loyal [tools for assassination](https://imgur.com/LnkP6zL.png), they’re in many ways undeniably human. They cry. They bleed. They love. But their assassinations are uncanny, and that discrepancy makes it difficult for everyone else to treat them as human. Their handlers are older men who are generally ostracized or isolated from the rest of society for various reasons. As a result, their main social interactions come from one another and their cybernetic charges. These men are forced to [confront the posthuman](https://imgur.com/UNqdPTq.png), and how they react says a lot about what makes posthumanism so challenging to embrace.

##Cyborgs as tools

Each fratello has a story to tell about posthumanism. But none are quite as traditional as [Jean and Rico](https://imgur.com/bWlD0Hj.png). As a handler, Jean is *the* strict professional. He truly embodies the us vs. them mentality suggested by humanism. Jean sees his cyborg, Rico, and the others as [nothing more than tools](https://imgur.com/HCDg2DX.png). He even goes as far as to give his cyborg a [boy’s name](https://imgur.com/xbyOTOp.png), denying her gender identity and creating emotional distance. However, Rico has no concern over her treatment or new lifestyle. Because she retained her memories in spite of the conditioning, she only sees the improvements from her previous life and [finds the tradeoffs worthwhile](https://imgur.com/646m13Z.png). As a result, she is the most obedient of the group, readily sacrificing [her own](https://imgur.com/ucG0QyH.png) [happiness](https://imgur.com/OKsvopI.png) for [the sake of Jean and the SWA](https://imgur.com/hzMm3Dj.png). Even as Rico steadily begins to show more interest in other things like [love](https://imgur.com/vOppcQF.png), Jean is quick to shut down any attempts for Rico to indulge herself. At some point, [Rico expresses her fear of death](https://imgur.com/GuOAr1U.png), but even that desire for life is [denied](https://imgur.com/GwV9j0f.png) [by Jean](https://imgur.com/SW30iHE.png). [Cyborgs are meant to die for their handlers](https://imgur.com/HhRF7Dj.png). 

This fratello serves as a traditional representative of humanism. Jean prioritizes the handlers and the agency over the cyborgs. He goes out of his way to reject the cyborgs’ desires and makes it clear that they serve humankind. And Rico happily plays the role of the tool, and calmly accepts Jean’s viewpoints. [Even if that means taking physical abuse](https://imgur.com/DJbk2xL.png). That sort of apathy only evokes a sense of [inhumanness](https://imgur.com/p3Mf9MW.png), but her interests in [art](https://imgur.com/XZUmphL.png) and the [meteor shower](https://imgur.com/kpxCK5P.png) reveal her personality buried under the dedication to Jean. Their relationship emphatically argues that this humanistic perspective suppresses the cyborg and denies the posthuman their freedom.

##Cyborgs as strangers

[Marco and Angela](https://imgur.com/n6lUfQU.png) are the first fratello of the SWA. Angela is the original cyborg, and [Marco takes to her immediately](https://imgur.com/UrgzXMT.png). The two form a [close bond](https://imgur.com/0ry4epK.png), thanks to the initial idleness of the SWA. Marco doted on Angela and the latter received an abundance of love from the rest of the agency. However, [his feelings begin to change](https://imgur.com/CpBbgij.png) when Angela begins combat and their relationship falters as the continuous conditioning wears down [Angela’s memory](https://imgur.com/6rM9Tdb.png). Marco becomes [distraught](https://imgur.com/lGQovUe.png) over the impact of Angela’s [conditioning](https://imgur.com/1Nr9Lo5.png) and, believing her to have [changed from their first meeting](https://imgur.com/8p9grVh.png), [grows](https://imgur.com/z8rwJWu.png) [distant](https://imgur.com/7rmKY6q.png). They become [further estranged](https://imgur.com/6ViPbr3.png) as Angela’s attempts to win Marco back [end in repeated failure](https://imgur.com/pnqCyU3.png). Eventually, her time runs out, and [thanks to Henrietta’s insistent efforts](https://imgur.com/TmMbwfq.png), [Marco and Angela](https://imgur.com/81EGtbF.png) are able to share [her final moments together](https://imgur.com/YiZg0ma.png).

In clear opposition to Jean, Marco did not see Angela as a cyborg at first. She was a human just like everybody else. But as Angela further cyberizes, she strays from that initial person Marco knew. Their relationship clearly illustrates how man’s attachment to the cyborg is predicated on how human it appears. As the veneer of the innocent girl fell away, Angela was ostracized. Rico represents cyborgs as a tool. But Angela represents that defined border between humans and posthumans. Angela does everything she can to meet the expectations of Marco and reposition herself in Marco’s good graces. But her actions as a cyborg would never be enough to bridge that divide. When Angela is hospitalized, Marco actually seeks to repair their relationship, but those efforts could also be interpreted as an affirmation of his loyalty to the Angela before all the conditioning. Marco is seen [hunting for the dog](https://imgur.com/hXYS52d.png) she used to own in her life prior to the SWA. Marco is still thinking about the human Angela [instead of spending more of his time with cyborg Angela](https://imgur.com/5frgw9T.png). Even at her deathbed, he still didn’t want this stranger wearing Angela’s skin.

##Cyborgs as humans

[Claes and Ravallo](https://imgur.com/vZGTRWz.png) are only together for a single episode, which serves as an origin story for Claes. She’s the one cyborg that mysteriously stays at the agency without a handler. In a flashback, Ravallo is shown joining the SWA as a favor for Jean. He ends up building a close bond with his cyborg, Claes. Despite being told to treat her as a tool, Ravallo can’t help but learn more about [Claes’ past](https://imgur.com/a8Sx316.png), going so far as to use [her original name](https://imgur.com/xh2KE9B.png) [instead of a new one](https://imgur.com/wqjPPkB.png). They bond over [fishing](https://imgur.com/VGVoJjF.png) and [books](https://imgur.com/G860DM8.png), and Ravallo [treats her as a human](https://imgur.com/la6PZNt.png). But after a disagreement between Jose and Ravallo turns into an almost fatal shootout between [Henrietta](https://imgur.com/XkzCaGJ.png) and [Claes](https://imgur.com/MhFH1r7.png), Ravallo attempts to [expose](https://imgur.com/kXqfo1Q.png) [the SWA](https://imgur.com/YzWErBA.png). As a result, it is heavily implied that [he was assassinated](https://imgur.com/OtijTXm.png), and [Claes becomes unable to operate](https://imgur.com/ZU0OT08.png) or [even remember Ravallo](https://imgur.com/kDrjj6h.png), due to the mental toll of losing her handler. 

This episode covers a gradual development in Ravallo’s perspective on cyborgs. It starts with the [distaste](https://imgur.com/3NHOokw.png) Ravallo feels towards the program and Claes, and ends with him [feeling disgust towards himself](https://imgur.com/9d7MNJo.png) for supporting this system. [His last words to Claes are not only a plea to choose compassion over violence](https://imgur.com/muilBv7.png), but also [a request instead of an order](https://imgur.com/oWAZ63j.png). Ravallo rejects the SWA, and even attempts to return agency to Claes. [He goes as far as to return Claes’ original glasses](https://imgur.com/oPjkaiE.png), something only the human Claes wore prior to the SWA. In many ways, this change in relationship is the philosophy posthumanists extol. Ravallo fights against the government’s intentions to use these girls as weapons. But it falls short of the grander philosophy which is about decentralizing humans. Ravallo wants Claes to return to being a young girl - the way he clings to her original name and her glasses reveals that [he did not care for the cyborg](https://imgur.com/VL0tICQ.png) but for the human Claes once was. And Claes had never even asked to return to her former life. She would’ve been happy continuing to work by Ravallo’s side. Ravallo’s last actions are kind, but also a clear refutation of cyborgs in favor of humans.

So if being too compassionate to your cyborg is not posthumanism, and treating your cyborg as a weapon is not posthumanism, what is? 

##Cyborgs as cyborgs

[Jose \(sometimes spelled Giuse\) and Henrietta are our main pairing](https://imgur.com/Q0HDJr0.png). This fratello occupies a very interesting position in our humanism-posthumanism sliding scale. As such, Jose occupies a middle ground with respect to his feelings towards the cyborgs. He initially chooses Henrietta because of her dire circumstances: her entire family was slaughtered by a serial murderer, and the conditioning of the SWA was her only chance at survival. As a result of her conditioning, [Henrietta falls in love with Jose](https://imgur.com/sH1VwX7.png), but this loyalty also causes her to [go berserk any time he is threatened](https://imgur.com/leajXlE.png). He’s torn between his [guilt for functionally brainwashing a young girl](https://imgur.com/Ayqg5Mk.png) into a tool for murder and his desire for revenge against the terrorists who killed his family. As a result, Jose [spoils Henrietta](https://imgur.com/kDmsKrb.png) [as much as possible](https://imgur.com/JwsNuhy.png), [buying her gifts](https://imgur.com/jYECW6x.png) and [indulging in her requests](https://imgur.com/VTUXa5L.png). As sweet as they are to each other, it’s hard to ignore how Jose is so willing to sacrifice Henrietta in service of his retribution. He’s clearly using her as a tool, like his brother Jean.

However, there’s a turning point for our main duo in episode 11, when [agents from another SWA section](https://imgur.com/Fp0oI9q.png) are investigating the [murder of another fratello](https://imgur.com/PTJ44FT.png). They go to meet Henrietta and Jose because Triela, another cyborg, had advised them that [Jose and Henrietta were the people to see to learn more about fratello relationships](https://imgur.com/6bJTXji.png). The agents observe the [fondness the two have for each other](https://imgur.com/p7hG2Vh.png) and the [inhuman abilities](https://imgur.com/9BuBfsZ.png) of Henrietta in action. And of course those investigators [feel](https://imgur.com/jlEWRT9.png) [disgust](https://imgur.com/Fh1Ii8h.png) over what Henrietta has become and the way Jose uses Henrietta as a shield. But that perception gets flipped on its head. Henrietta ends up [revealing](https://imgur.com/CtN13zs.png) that the murders of the fratello were likely a result of a [murder-suicide](https://imgur.com/DnHZxOY.png): the cyborg killed her handler after realizing her handler will never [love](https://imgur.com/I9cENqC.png) [her](https://imgur.com/5pO3bqc.png) back. How did Henrietta know? It’s what [she would do](https://imgur.com/CRklAso.png) of course! And in a very sane move, Henrietta [pretends to shoot herself](https://imgur.com/myIsaF0.png) to [test](https://imgur.com/Pww3EsP.png) [Jose’s love](https://imgur.com/1Od3FlE.png). To which Jose passes with flying colors. 

The cyborgs are incredibly loyal and it may seem like the handlers take advantage of them. But this balance of power lies on a more precarious tightrope than it appears: handler and cyborg must maintain a form of [symbiosis](https://imgur.com/xX9xFMR.png). All the conditioning in the world is moot if the cyborg deems their fratello a lost cause. Throughout the season, it’s easy to fall into the trap that Jose is [manipulating Henrietta’s emotions](https://imgur.com/ZgudHKv.png) through gifts and outings. They are the most affectionate fratello and in some ways it becomes unsettling how close they are knowing that Henrietta’s love will likely never be returned. [But she understands that](https://imgur.com/ZgudHKv.png). [Jose understands it too](https://imgur.com/GK2iDsz.png). That’s why he says that handlers must be “[someone they can respect](https://imgur.com/P6Ks7xj.png),” not love. You don’t say that if the conditioning makes betrayal an impossibility.

And that’s what makes Henrietta and Jose the relationship closest to the ideals of posthumanism. We’ve set up this patriarchal structure within the fratellos in the previous examples, but with this reveal that cyborgs can kill their handlers, that hierarchy has changed. The power dynamic hasn’t quite equalized completely, [but the dividing line has blurred a bit](https://imgur.com/UpJhtqv.png). There’s a more nuanced give and take going on than what we expected. And that can be attributed to the [cyborgs’ self awareness](https://imgur.com/Rz6uela.png). We’ve viewed these fratello relationships so far based on how their handlers treat their cyborgs. Of course we’re horrified: this is [slavery](https://imgur.com/ZOZJBCV.png). [But the viewer hasn’t been asking how the cyborgs feel](https://imgur.com/7OHaywc.png). And as we’ve seen in every previous fratello, [they accept it](https://imgur.com/SkAaU1M.png). They accept that they’re subservient to a group of men [who see them](https://imgur.com/zC3Edl1.png) as [replaceable](https://imgur.com/jxDX4EB.png). But those circumstances [aren’t a reason to give up on life](https://imgur.com/qZNjyUR.png). Henrietta throughout the season has also been pondering her place in the world. [She’s accepted her fate](https://imgur.com/T1tLpAW.png). The [conditioning is a part of who she is](https://imgur.com/MSYjrWm.png), and [she still finds it meaningful in spite of the evil committed against her](https://imgur.com/Ek4j1Sk.png). 

So much of posthumanism is about challenging the status quo. It’s about embracing multiple subjectivities and the blending of traditional roles whether they are ones of gender, politics, or cyborgs. Henrietta challenges both handlers and viewers to reconsider [how they look](https://imgur.com/sL1xjrg.png) [at the cyborgs](https://imgur.com/s8LKdg0.png). The domination we and Jose thought he had over Henrietta has evolved into a more collaborative relationship that [requires work from both partners](https://imgur.com/4Cg1s3M.png). The gender positions have been reversed in a few capacities, such as how in this show [the women protect the males](https://imgur.com/NbhSXNM.png). The boundary has been broken. Henrietta is [not a girl](https://imgur.com/WIpem89.png). [She is a cyborg](https://imgur.com/N73UuQY.png). The posthuman is here.

##Conclusion

In many ways, *Gunslinger Girl* does not embrace the posthuman. It places prepubescent girls at the mercy of white men, reaffirming the dominant male and submissive female gender and racial roles, and fails to collapse the patriarchal structure of the SWA. But Henrietta and Jose show us the way forward to posthumanism. This fratello takes the first step over this boundary by encouraging us to reevaluate our preconceived and heavily human-centric perspectives. Their relationship isn’t equitable yet, but if you’re willing to see from Henrietta’s eyes, you’ll find that there’s more power and dignity in her position than what you assumed. 

And I don’t think that’s uncommon. Many popular sci-fi works hover at the threshold of posthumanism: they challenge viewers on their assumptions on humanity, and constantly ask them if these posthumans are any different from them. *Star Wars* asks if robots like R2-D2 are human. *Her* asks if AI like Samantha are human. Gunslinger Girl asks if Henrietta is human. We’ll keep saying yes until one day we don’t. And it will not be no because the posthuman isn’t human enough. It will be no because there are no more humans left.",False,anime,1707525714.0,1an3ib8,Writing

edit: I was not clear about the non-serious part. What I mean with non-serious is anime that was funny without intending to be funny. I also include anime that was trying to be funny.

The father eventually passed away and left his son's and wife along with the girl behind. The mother grew to hate the girl over time don't even remember why and then the oldest son had to leave and look for a job to support his family. So he left to the city. I don't know what happened to the younger brother but I know that in the meantime as the older brother was gone the mother told the girl that she was actually found and she's not her mother and to stop calling her that. The girl eventually left and idk how but like met this guy who's very rich and all and yea.

What anime were heavily hyped and anticipated but turned out to be a disappointment?,"Some shows in mind:

1. **Akame Ga Kill** \- This was the first show that came to mind. First half was really great and intense, but then the character deaths and terrible pacing in the second cour tanked the show.
2. **Tokyo Revengers** \- This is the most notable one. I assume all the hype was lost considering how terrible the manga ended, and the MC is unbearable because he always gets his ass whooped, and Disney getting their hands on the anime really screwed up its promotion and marketing.
3. **The Tokyo Mew Mew Reboot** \- I got excited when a reboot was going to be made for the original series in the 2000's. While it was hyped and talked about a lot because of its cute and more colorful polish, the reboot itself unfortunately didn't live up to expectations. It was rather bland and lackluster.
4. I know it's still ongoing, but **Mato Seihei no Slave (Chained Soldier)** is already a mess despite being a very hyped ecchi harem show this season. The sloppy CGI, skipped ""rewards"" scenes from the manga, weird character designs and mediocre background art, the female MC Kyouka's voice doesn't fit her, and the censorship are really a bother.

Anime doesn't make me feel strong emotions. I kinda want it to.,"So I'm kinda new to watching anime. I've tried in the past but I have a bad habit of losing interest in long shows. So anyway I've seen maybe 10 or 15 anime most if which could be considered sad or had really sad moments. Sword Art Online is the only anime to have ever made me cry (idk why). So I guess I'm looking for something that will really get my emotions going. Whether it be sad or happy I just want to enjoy anime, and most of my enjoyment in movies, and tv shows comes from how attached I get to it. I'd love some recommendations. <3",False,anime,1707494048.0,1amr9h4,What to Watch?
"anime appreciation, feeling emotionally drained...","**No spoilers for any shows mentioned here, and appreciate anyone who takes time to read this splat :)**

I decided to start watching anime in December with the goal of watching shows that did not have over sexualised female characters/ too much fan service, this started with the first episode of **Frieren Beyond Journey's End.** I watched all that had aired and I loved it so much that I thought about it all the time, rewatched scenes, repeated full episodes and listened to the music constantly. I also ordered the manga books but I won't read them yet as I want to follow the show first. I am eyeing up a cool (but expensive :( lol) figurine. **I am caught up as far as E18 so not spoilers please** ;)

I then went on to watch **Violet Evergarden** (the series) and this one really left me in an absolute state, I was constantly getting sad thinking about everything and again had to keep rewatching scenes and was totally obsessed with the music. I even ordered some figurines which cost more than I would care to admit lol. The story of this anime is so touching I almost can't think about it. I have seen the final movie but I don't include it amongst my passions.

I was very nervous about my next choice, after watching the previous two I considered taking a break because I worried nothing could meet those standards and emotions, but next came **Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song** and it absolutely blew me away. This one was so interesting, especially when rewatching scenes to actually understand the (at times) complicated plot kept adding more layers and reasons to love the show. This one also got me very emotional too and I love rewatching scenes / listening to the music. Also ordered a figurine, light novel collection and a plush.

Then it was time for **Girls' Last Tour,** this one took an episode or 2 to click but I came to really love this show and the characters - except for what I considered to be a couple of unnecessary depictions. This one didn't have me rewatching scenes/ music as much as the others, but overall I felt that I had watched something really special and it left me feeling like I actually missed the characters. I have now ordered some of the light novels that will hopefully give me a little more of this story. There are some cool little figures available for this one but the sale prices are way too high, maybe one day.

Most recently I watched **Spice And Wolf.** This one almost got turned off in the first episode because I thought it was just going to be some creepy ""oooo cute wolf girl"" gimmick and not much more, but the voice acting (english dub in my case) was so incredible that I had to give it a chance, and after watching a few episodes I could not believe how amazing this show was, and in such good taste. There is such a captivating and complex dynamic between the characters achieved through top class dialog and story telling, these characters could do nothing but walk around chatting all day and I would love watching it. I felt absolutely destroyed when the credits of the last episode rolled knowing there was no more. I was recommended the audio books of the light novels to continue with the story and when I started listening to one I actually teared up just because I was so happy to be back with these characters again. I ordered a little figurine for this one (it was hard to get one that wasn't creepy but I found a nice one) and I will also have copies of the light novels for my collection.

All in all I am emotionally drained by these shows haha, I cannot believe how interesting and beautiful these stories have been, how incredible some of the animation was, how amazing the music was, and how inspired the voice acting was.

I can't wait to watch more anime in future but for now I think I need a break rewatching Sopranos or something, these shows just hit too damn hard :(",False,anime,1707493819.0,1amr6an,Discussion

[ANNOUNCEMENT] r/anime sings 192: Brand New World (One Piece OP 6),"Hello everyone! As much as I was thinking my previous project would be my last one, I’m here once again to announce yet another r/anime sings project! About halfway through last year, I started what quickly became my second favorite anime of all time, one I’m sure we’re all familiar with: One Piece. I was surprised to learn that the only r/anime sings project we’ve done for it so far was *We Are!* in 2017, so I decided it was time I fix that. I put this project up to a vote a month ago, and the winner was quite clear: we’ll be singing OP 6, *Brand New World*. I’m excited for it, since this OP in particular got very little time in the spotlight.

WHAT IF??? (ANIME EDITION),"There are a lot of decisions made in anime which are usually amazing. But sometimes they are outright bad like giving plot armor to certain characters, killing off characters way too early, power of friendship/love, or plain one-dimensional characters who never change, etc. Or sometimes you just wanted it to turn out differently even though the original idea was good enough.

So how would you alter elements of the story, and what impact do you think these changes would have on the overall plot?

For example, ever wonder what would have happened if in:

**(SPOILERS AHEAD)**

* \[Dragon Ball\] >!You cannot resurrect someone when they die / Goku kills  Vegeta and several others whenever he has the chance.!<
* \[Death Note\] >!Light manages to win at the end instead of dying / L somehow manages to escape death by outsmarting Light.!<
* \[Naruto\] >!Kurama never turns good / Orochimaru possesses Sasuke as planned / Naruto and Sasuke never get sudden power-ups at the end / Neji doesn't die during the war.!<

**P.S. These things are not just limited to Shounen. We also got Romance, Slice of Life, etc.**",False,anime,1707484289.0,1amntqf,Discussion

Which animes will never be forgotten?,"Dragonballz and Pokemon are the first ones to come to my mind. They started it all and still to this day whenever they get new content people get hyped like the sparking zero trailer. Next up are Naruto and One piece obviously. They were the biggest animes in 2000's era and have been a huge cultural phenomenon. I am kinda iffy about Bleach on the other hand. Sure it was part of the big three in the west but during its absence and hatred from the community it heavily declined in popularity. Yes Naruto did also get hate but there are still so many people talking about it as compared to Bleach which isn't anywhere as recognizable as the other two.

Other animes that come to my mind are Yu gi oh and Sailor Moon. However I don't really see people talking about them despite being classics like DBZ. Yu Gi Oh is popular because of its cards not necessarily due to its anime and Sailor Moon isn't even as popular as Bleach in these times.

There can be a case for Jjk and Aot but it depends if they are still being talked about 5 or 6 years later down the line. Aot has ended so it may effect its popularity and Jjk's manga is also closer to its end.

I am for a new anime to watch, and I thought that it would be helpful to provide a list of anime that I enjoyed (and why) and ones I didn’t (and why not).

Also, I listed at the bottom a few options that I have heard great things about, so I’d love feedback with those as well!

LIKES

Attack on Titan- my first anime ever. In love with the world building, the politics, and the fast paced storyline that left me guessing!

Code Geass- my most recent watch. Once again, I love the politics, the world building, and fast paced storyline. I also really liked the some of the romantic elements… which I didn’t think that I’d care about lol.

Elfen Lied- full disclosure, I was told to try this one for the tits… certainly didn’t disappoint lol. The story was great, and the gore was just ridiculous but not in a bad way. Def not a favorite, but I would watch it again.

DISLIKES

Death Note- I liked the concept, it was just too slow for me. I found myself getting bored. Also, the character development just wasn’t there for me. Too wordy, not enough action.

Fullmetal Alchemist- to be 100% fair, I’m not sure that I gave this one a sufficient chance. I got through about four or five episodes and just thought “I don’t know why, but I just don’t like this”


Anime that I’m considering

Kill La Kill

Devilman Crybaby 
Demon Slayer

Just found and watched a true hidden gem of 2014: Nobunaga Concerto,"Synopsis:  History classes have never interested Saburo. He never saw the point of learning something that happened in the past, let alone a few hundred years ago. But when he falls off a wall, he travels through a wormhole and ends up in 16th century ancient Japan. He meets a very young Oda Nobunaga, one of the most influential figures in Japanese history, who turns out to be identical in appearance as Saburo. The real Nobunaga, sick of the castle life and wanting to travel, orders Saburo to take his place. Without knowing how to get back to his time, Saburo tries to make sure history isn’t rewritten for the infamous Oda Nobunaga.

&#x200B;

Review:  

The anime may initially deter viewers due to its CGI-like art style, but this aspect quickly becomes inconsequential when compared to the richness of its narrative. The story revolves around Saburo, a disinterested student of history who unexpectedly finds himself thrust into 16th century ancient Japan after a fortuitous fall. Here, he encounters a young Oda Nobunaga, and their striking resemblance leads to Saburo assuming Nobunaga's identity at the latter's behest. What follows is a gripping tale of Saburo's attempts to navigate the intricacies of history while safeguarding its integrity.

With a rating of 9/10, this anime captivates audiences with its compelling characters, witty humor, and exhilarating battle sequences. Moreover, it offers valuable insights into Japan's Sengoku era, cleverly intertwining historical events with imaginative storytelling. While the narrative takes creative liberties with famous historical figures, it maintains enough fidelity to keep it recognizable and engaging. As a fan of time travel narratives, this series stands out as a favorite, delivering an immensely satisfying viewing experience.

However, the disappointment lies in its brevity, spanning only 10 episodes. Thankfully, fans can delve deeper into the intricacies of the story through the extensive manga series, comprising 22 volumes. Anticipation mounts for the release of the final volume, promising closure to this captivating saga. Avoiding spoilers, I wholeheartedly recommend this anime to anyone seeking a blend of history, adventure, and entertainment.",False,anime,1707455423.0,1amgg2l,Watch This!

Fixing Dragon Ball GT's Super 17 Saga,"Dragon Ball GT's Super 17 Saga is something even most of its fans won't defend and recommend skipping. Even considering the series run being cut short, I still have no idea what anybody was thinking with this arc. We have a bunch of past villains escaping Hell, which is just used as a backdrop for an arc where Android 17 turns evil and fuses with a copy of himself that was somehow built in Hell. Why Dr. Gero and Dr. Myuu aren't bothering with enhancing Cell or Rildo, their creations who defeated Goku, and the latter still being loyal, is anybody's guess.

&#x200B;

Despite Super 17 being set up as the main villain, 17 is barely in the arc with most of the focus being on the easily killed past villains. The villain with the most screen time is Dr. Myuu, someone nobody was interested in seeing. Super 17 has almost no personality, acting as the type of muscle head villain we'd expect from on serial Z movies. His fight with Goku is terrible, once Goku turns Super Saiyan 4, he uses a barrage of ki attack and keeps using more when that doesn't work, which isn't how Goku normally fights. The reveal that Super 17 absorbs ki attacks is treated as him being immune to any attack Goku can launch, even though Goku could still use physical attacks (in fact he uses those more than ki attacks), plus when Super 17 stops moving because the main 17 fights to gain control, Goku punches a hole in him, at his base level.

&#x200B;

I have seen suggestions for how to fix this arc by having a more sensible explanation for why 17, and also 18 (a popular suggestion is having 18 become an antagonist), becomes evil and is a threat when the last time we saw the androids fight, they were fodder for Cell. I don't see what the point of turning the android siblings evil is. Especially 17, he barely appeared after the Cell Saga so there isn't much impact to him becoming a villain.

&#x200B;

If the route of the android being villains is used, then the anime should have given them more screen time. They could have taken part in the Dragon Ball hunt and/or appeared as allies in the Baby Saga, explaining that because they were partially mechanical, Baby couldn't control them. Having them remain allies when so many characters were controlled by a villain would have had the siblings becoming enemies have far more impact.

&#x200B;

If anybody has any other ideas for how they would make the idea of the 17 & 18 being made into tragic villains, leave a comment.

&#x200B;

Personally, I would scrap (no pun intended) the idea of using the androids as villains. Myuu and Gero kicking off the arc could stay. Gero recruits Myuu to assist with the plan to escape Hell. By using parts from Myuu's various minions who got sent to Hell, the evil scientists build a device that locates the Soul Cleansing Machine, taking inspiration from Fusion Reborn. This device has been siphoning off power from the villains to keep them growing more powerful, as well as removing the evil from the souls of evildoers who chose to reincarnate.

&#x200B;

The villains blow up the machine, and the release of evil makes them more powerful than ever. Rather than being comic relief, Cell and Frieza led the onslaught of evildoers as they broke out of Hell to take their revenge on Goku and his friends.

&#x200B;

From here, we get a series of fights with the protagonists fighting the past villains. I haven't thought of all the matchups except for the climax.

&#x200B;

Cell finds Mr. Satan and reveals him to be a fraud by killing one of Mr. Satan's fans on live television. He doesn't care about Mr. Satan taking credit for defeating him (he didn't even realize it happened) he is merely hoping to break the world's spirits. Cell is faced by Gohan, who is not nerfed in my version of events, and Pan, who is not a damsel in distress in my version of events. Gohan barely gets to do anything, especially with his daughter. Given how much screen time Pan gets, her father should get to do something with her. Cell is eager for the chance to get revenge on Gohan (not Goku; GT forgets that Gohan killed Cell, not Goku) and promises to make him watch as his daughter and father-in-law.

&#x200B;

In the end, a father/daughter Kamehameha kills Cell.

&#x200B;

Vegeta has an encounter with Nappa and does apologize for killing him. In the anime, Nappa and Vegeta's encounter does nothing it being Nappa, you could replace Nappa with any villain who was killed by Vegeta. I don't believe that this could lead to Nappa getting redeemed; Vegeta's redemption took a very specific set of circumstances, but if anybody has any ideas for what a redemption arc might look like, again, feel free to leave a comment. I want to hear ideas.

&#x200B;

The other main event is a rematch with Frieza, and I would rather Vegeta defeat him rather than Goku. Vegeta deserves a break.

&#x200B;

After each villain is beaten, they lose the power they gained from absorbing the raw concentrated evil so they wouldn't escape a second time.

&#x200B;

If anybody has any more ideas, please leave a comment. And please do not leave comments that boil down to ""GT was a mistake"" or ""this arc wouldn't work no matter what...""

"Getting a good ""overview"" of the anime scene for research?","I'm writing a novel where the protagonist is a walking encyclopedia of anime (and games, but this isn't r/gaming) and often sees life through a lens of tropes and references.  I've been an on-again-off-again weeb since I was little in the late 90's, so I definitely have a broad-brushstroke knowledge, but I haven't been seriously into it for the better part of the last decade, so my knowledge is way behind, and there's been such an explosion of new titles since then that I feel hopelessly lost trying to catch up.

Are there any ways you'd recommend trying to get an overview of the shows I should check out and .  For example, when I was a kid, I had a copy of The Anime Encyclopedia (that was when most of the notable anime that existed could fit in one book) and one other I can't remember the name of, but I don't think there's been anything like that for a while.

I research by listening to podcasts like Trash Taste and video essays on various titles that seem interesting while I'm cleaning up around the apartment and stuff - and when one catches my eye, I'll watch a few episodes to get a feel of it. But I still feel like I'm just scratching the surface and am dismayed by how limited my scope is, and by how little of each series I usually have time to get into.  (Having a job and responsibilities and stuff.) 

By the way, MC is 28F, with a taste for shojo, magical girls, and CGDCT, but also deep, immersive, and lore-heavy shows that make you think a lot like Evangelion, FMA, Lain, Steins;Gate, etc.  And the story is set in 2020, so at least I don't have to worry about shows produced after then.",False,anime,1707445236.0,1amd7n8,Help

Best Girl of Fall 2023: Seasonal Salt with Animebracket Reborn! Nomination Day!,"Hi guys! More than four months have passed and I’m more than exciting to come back to hold out best girl of fall 2023 with our dear Animebracket Reborn! Some of you might have heard about it already, our dear friends from [Animethemes.moe](https://animethemes.moe/) show up just in time and to take the job of maintaining Animebracket. Since then they have made great effort to clean the database of Animebracket and make a beta version to test Animebracket and yesterday they finally made Animebracket public again. Lots of thanks to them! And if you have any suggestions or find any potential problems or bugs about Animebracket, you can join the [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/m9zbVy) of [Animethemes.moe](https://animethemes.moe/) to communicate with our current moderator teams of Animebracket!

So finally now is the time again for our: [Seasonal Salt!](#salt ""Seasonal Salt!"") 

Here's the quick rundown of the contest for those who aren't familiar with it (especially after a suspend of more than four months). Through the next week we will decide who [r/anime](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/)'s favorite new girl of the previous season was. Rounds will be posted **daily** at about 9pm Eastern Standard Time. (As many of previous voters might not hear the news about the reborn of Animebracket I decided to move to the old time for fall contest as it seems the traffic volume of r/anime are also higher at the original time).

**Bracket rundown:**

* 64 total girls
* **1 nomination round**
* 1 elimination round
* 1 bracket group

**Please remember to check the rules in the nomination page and who is already in the contest before nominating!**

Also, as have been discussed before in [annual salt 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/116rwo3/and_ranime_s_best_girl_of_2022_is/j983u9i/), there will be a pick-up mechanism for top sixteen-losers to fight for wild card slots for annual best girl. 

Remainder: The rule about whether or not a girl in a sequel that has appeared in the previous seasonal but do not enter the previous seasonal could be nominated in this seasonal is clarified in the current seasonal rule. As long as **she has never passed the elimination and entered the main bracket for any previous best girl/best character contests** she could be nominated. Hope this modification could help some girls who just do not get their shiny moments in the previous season get their actual chance for the seasonal!

When the new episode of a show comes out, I’ll try to ask myself what happened on the one before (does it make sense?) and most of the time I can’t remember it, and it irritates me.
But, when I try to watch the episode before the latest in order to remember what happened, just a few frame will be enough to remember everything.

Need an ultra specific rec,"I'm fairly new to anime and I'm looking to see if there's something that has everything I'm looking for and maybe more importantly, what I'm avoiding. After a few entries, I've discovered what I really enjoy is a love story. Here's what has struck me so far:


Cyberpunk: Edgerunners

Basically perfect. It's mature, enthralling, amazing soundtrack, excellent characterization, hyper emotional, and it doesn't drag on. I do wish it had a happier ending but maybe that would have detracted from it overall. I love cyberpunk setting anyway which is what drew me to the show but David and Lucy made it perfect. I also like that they don't draw the silly faces, people don't blush constantly at inane things, and no one speaks in a register only audible to dolphins.

Darling in the Franxx:

Saw this because it came recommended after cyberpunk. Everything about 02 and Hiro is perfect. Everything else.. not so much. Aside from those two, it seems like everyone else is characterized as clueless and lifeless. I also think it's really off-putting how sexualized the act of piloting is; it gets to the point where there is so much innuendo that it honestly would be less cringy if they just had sex. It seemed like there were a lot of plot holes based around that fact too. On top of that, I don't like giant robots. I see why this came recommended but I would rather watch a supercut of just 02 and Hiro.

Castlevania:

Shockingly good. Came recommended since it's also based on a game. Crazy good voice actors, it looks like a lot of care went into animating it. Trevor and Sypha are fun to watch together and I'm glad they got a happy ending. This show really should have been shorter, they jumped the shark so many times. Besides that, I think most everyone is well characterized. 

Horimiya:

Came recommended when looking for something romantic. It definitely fits that bill but I think it suffers from the same problem as Darling in the Franxx. If it was just Hori and Miyamura, it would have been more interesting. It also does silly faces way too often. I like how realistic Hori is. I also like that they use sex as just a symbol to show romantic connection and not a plot device to create drama. 

What I gather is that I want to find something centering around a couple. The setting doesn't matter as much as long as the two characters coming together is not the focus of the plot. I like more realism and a more mature tone. Interestingly I think shows that include nudity and sex scenes tend to automatically skew toward the tone I prefer since they have to be aimed at a mature audience. And, if possible, happy endings are better- though sometimes a sad ending is the whole reason a show is good.
I also wanna hear from you if you just like the same shows I do!

TL;DR
What's a show with a couple like Lucy and David or 02 and Hiro?",False,anime,1707424444.0,1am5ibd,What to Watch?
"Those of you who grew up in the 90's with anime, do you miss this Era of anime / Time when things seemed more ""action oriented""","Weird question but, does anybody miss their childhood days of watching anime and adolescence of it?  
Shows like  
Cowboy Bebop, DBZ, Trigun, Outlaw Star, Inuyasha, Gundam Wing, Even Naruto  
I guess this would be shonen genre  
But also shows like Hayao Miyazaki Movies / Escaflowne / EVA / Utena / Project A-ko

I mean, I dunno what I'm trying to say really. I feel like a lot of modern animes are more ""Moe"" or ""Fanservice"" or ""Realistic / Mature Themed"" I guess this would Seinen..  
90s had moe too like tenchi muyo / love hina and everything but Anime felt ""different"" back then to me, like I'd be SUPER HYPED to watch it and waiting for the next episodes, I think the last anime I was like this with was Bleach

I don't know what point I'm trying to make here TBH lol. Basically, there was a certain feeling I use to have with watching anime back then week by week and keeping up with newest episodes and being hyped for next ep that I no longer get anymore and everything seems more ""moe"" nowadays or rehashed type of shows I guess all the Isekai plots and modern convenience of being able to download full series and watch in a day has me burnt out a bit.

Just finished [Blend S],"SO i originally found this anime during COVID due to the Supra memes 2.5 years ago but didn't continue after 2nd episode for some reason.

Yesterday I was feeling quite nostalgic so I started watching and honestly it was such a joy to watch it.

The show all around has such a positive vibe, no bs drama about characters misunderstanding just 12 episodes of cute interactions.

The MC likes the FMC but isn't a creep about it, unlike other MCs he not drooling over the FMCs body and actually treats her like a human who makes mistakes at times, their interactions feel natural and not cliché as you'd expect from this kind of anime.

Our FMC Maika, she is one of the cutest anime characters I have ever seen, kind, caring, a little airhead at times but overall just a gentle person.

Anyway, this was a really nostalgic experience, although I am sure COVID was a bad time period for many people but everyone in my family was fine and it was one of the most carefree and happy period of my life.

Watching this reminded me of all those memes during COVID lol, I feel really happy rn

I will read the manga tomorrow and I hope Maika and Dino get a happy ending.",False,anime,1707420298.0,1am3uqy,Discussion

make a crew for a starship :D," You must crew a starship with anime people.

You must have:

Captain.

First Officer.

Operations.

Navigation.

Tactical,

Medical.

you may have any other crew at positions you think would fit.

Clearly you could go with people that know what they are doing (Henry Gloval, Robotech for Captain)

Or you could go with just - whoever is funny or you think could do the job well enough. Or maybe you will crash and burn :D

They can be all from the same anime but cooler if they are not.

\~\~\~

Captain: Kasumi/Misty (Pokemon)

First Officer. Light Yagami (Death Note)

Operations. Dana Sterling (Robotech)

Navigation. Mendoza (The Mysterious Cities of Gold) ((I count this as anime because it was French/Japanese team effort for S1 but I am not sure it ""counts"" as anime))

Tactical: Porco Rosso (Porco Rosso)

Medical: Sailor Mercury/Ami Mizuno (Sailor Moon)

\~\~\~\~

Misty likes to boss people around and given that she was a leader of a gym, she could do well as leader - if we tack on some age to her, she would work as a CO.

Light is hyper focused on justice once he gets the death note, but before that is a smart young adult, if he never encountered the Death Note he might indeed be very good at a role such as this.

Dana has been in the Southern Cross, and as such knows the ropes, so to speak, but she might not quite fit the mold for Ops, still she is smart enough and clever so maybe she could do okay.

Mendoza has used the stars to navagate the waters of the earth, with enough infomation, I think he could apply that to outerspace as well.

Porco knows how to fight :D

Ami always wanted to be a doctor, now she is one. \^\_\^

Incongruities in Sasaki and Peeps,"I’m watching episode five of Sasaki and Peeps, and I have some questions, so I’ll get straight to the point. 

The first thing I noticed is that the law enforcement dispatched to the crime scene were just casually speaking loud enough about Sasaki-san’s ability to spontaneously create icicles. At least, loud enough for his roommate to hear, which makes me wonder if leaks like this are often so easy to come across. This is modern Japan meaning there is access to the internet and information spreads like a memetic virus. Even if they could somehow stifle discussion around it, there is no way this super secret agency is lax about letting information get out and then only getting serious and putting their full power into silencing it when it does. 

The second is about Hoshizaki-san’s psychokinetic abilities. She can control the properties of water including its temperature, right? Surely she doesn’t *need* to bring a water bottle with her at all times, because she can just condensate the water vapor in the air. Tokyo is known for being especially humid because of its location on the Earth and [anthropogenic water vapor emissions](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2007WR006624) because of the urban environment.

I don’t understand why people hate fan service,"I genuinely don’t get it and it’s frankly annoying to see so many people completely throw out good stories because they were distracted by fan service and didn’t like it. I understand that there’s TPO for it but even when it seems out of place (ex. Tamaki from Fire Force), does it REALLY distract you? I can’t exactly bring a lot of examples where fan service is prevalently out of place because I don’t think I’ve ever noticed it tbh. The biggest of these is Fire Force based on the amount of complaints I’ve seen on it and even that complaint doesn’t make sense to me. Clearly the animanga doesn’t take itself seriously enough to even say that it gets completely ruined by fanservice, and the funniest part is that it is literally the part of Tamaki’s character. You can’t say it’s out of place when it’s been purposely built into the script from the beginning and has a genuine cause behind it that makes sense for the story. 

I’m just so confused by how people find it distracting to point of putting you off of the entire show. Is it just a tolerance difference between those who get put off and those who don’t? To me it sounds more like a personal inclination of the viewer to sexualize any revealing thing or erotic undertone. 

For some context on my standpoint. I don’t find a woman in a bikini sexually pleasing unless we’re in a romantic relationship, similarly I don’t find an anime character who got caught changing and just in her underwear pleasing either, thus in the the grand scheme of consuming, I’m not distracted nor pay it any mind.

I don’t mean any negativity towards those who do get put off by fan service, I’m just confused on the why it’s so distracting to you because it seems more like a personal sexualization than a problem with the show itself?",False,anime,1707362525.0,1alm04s,Discussion

Trying to find a old Ecchi anime,"I’m trying to remember the name of an old Ecchi anime from when I was younger. I remember some key details from it too.

The main girl had pink hair

It was from the 2000’s 

It was a Ecchi Harem anime

It had the characters go to school

The first part of the opening episode had the pink hair girl had a panty shot and got angel wings

It had 1 episode where the main character was tied up and in his swim suit

Another episode where it was raining and the main character helped out another girl apart of the Harem

There was a trio of girls who were the antagonist who hated the main character 

And finally I believe there was a OVA where the main characters went to the where it was uncensored and you got to see everything. 

And also in that OVA too the trio of girls piloted a robot

For a while I thought it was called Girls Bravo but it just showed me Bravo Girls. Another show I thought it might be was Heaven's Lost Property but the animation was too good to be that. The animation in the show I’m looking for is like early to mid 2000’s anime where it looked shiny and flat, similar to looking like elfin lied (and also no it’s not Elfin lied either it wasn’t gory).

[Spoilers] Paranoia Agent 20th Anniversary Rewatch -- Episode 5,"
Hello everyone! I am Holofan4life. 

Welcome to the Paranoia Agent 20th Anniversary Rewatch discussion thread! 

I hope you all have a lot of fun <3 

S1 Episode 5 – The Holy Warrior

—- 

ANSWER TODAY’S QUESTION(S)

If you were transported to another world, which reaction would you more likely have: Maniwa's, or Ikari's?

Did you ever think we would get a video game episode out of this show?

Bonus) Who would win in a fight: Holy Warrior, God Warrior, or The Ultimate Warrior?

Bonus 2) With the two detectives being transported into a video game world, does this technically make the show now an isekai?

"Came back from a long hiatus, need reccos","So Ive not watched a single anime since Parasyte, Another and OPM about a year + ago (maybe even more).

Recently I watched Hellgirl and ended up binging on more supernatural anime. Back to back completed Hellgirl, Shiki, the rooftop one with the schoolgirl and pantsu shots lol.

Tried watching The New World but Ive kinda tapped out midway, it just didnt click for me.
Of the recent ones Ive watched I think Shiki stuck with me the most. So Im looking for similar anime to that.

The animation shouldnt be too old or too weird style (laughing salesman). Action is fine but preferably mystery and thriller/supernatural.

Having trouble finding a good anime (I’m new to this medium) - can y’all recommend me something based on what I like?,"Hey! So, the only anime/manga I love so much so far is Death Note - watched the anime a year ago, now reading all the manga.

I’ve tried Demon Slayer - good, but I’d rather read it first, saving it for later, got the 1st manga volume

Currently watching Tokyo Ghoul - I mean.. it’s good. Not great, not bad, just good IMO so far (finishing season 1). 

otherwise, I like:
- The Witcher (books)
- Harry Potter (both) 
- The Walking Dead (both comics & TV show)
- Game of Thrones (also read all 5 released books)

Recomend finished anime with OP MC,"Hi there good people, i have watched quite a lot of anime lately and although i wibe with a lot of them (a lot of isekai, prog fantasy, OP MCs)  but im fed up with one or two seasons and neverending waiting. Recently i watched Arifureta wich i liked. Somewhat dickish OP MC (like shield hero season one) is nice food. But it is not finished. Like there is nothing with end. Isekai is basically never a finished show aside from old clasics like Magic night Rayearth or Hack.

So, recomend me some FINISHED (not canceled or on hiatus or Berserk) anime with OP MC, preferably with dickish personality but not necesary.  Can be fantasy, isekai, scify, whatever category Slime was.... i dont really care. 

Im kinda boomer in this.  In ye old times i feel like there were so many shows that told its story in season or two and now everything is Naruto (i love naruto but when i started it it was allmost over). I dont know how to navigate this anime climate. I did not watch much for a few years and its just copletely different climate now.

Thank you very much :)",False,anime,1707327845.0,1al8rzf,What to Watch?

Recommendations for similar anime please?,"Hi all!

Do you guys have any recommendations for Anime like these, and these reasons (doesn't have to be the same genre):

* **Solo Leveling**
   * Serious & dark (but not Shield Hero dark) beginning, undertone of mystery and intrigue of future events, fantastic art helps deliver on all of the above. There's also a real sense of progression for MC's power and story both.
   * Ofc the show is new with only a few episodes out, but it reminds me of Berserk of Gluttony but better (so far)
* **Apothecary Diaries** / **The Saint's Magic Power is Omnipotent**
   * Female MC that's not OP (in combat), emphasizing everyday stuff like research & studying & relationships with a budding romance, without being only about the romance either
   * A good, strong guy protecting the MC for that daww <3
* **World Trigger**
   * Just fantastic in every way, esp high internal consistency and logic behind every person & event, also an interesting story with progression

Also one last weird question: I just started watching Absolute Duo (not convinced so far but nvm that). In the first episode \[Spoilers: Absolute Duo s01e01\] >!the school forces the students to fight their partner, and only the winner gets admitted. I couldn't help but think: what if the MC had simply lost on purpose because: 1) the school lied and set those conditions to force the students to give their best so they could be measured for their potential, but were really going to allow admittance to both either way, or 2) the school really did use arbitrary, unreliable, even cruel methods to disqualify potentially brilliant students, in which case it didn't live up to its reputation and the MC would rather just take their skills elsewhere instead. Either way, from the MC's PoV losing would be the right choice.!<

Is there any anime where the MC openly stands up to and criticizes flawed systems and authorities regardless of consequences, but is also strong enough to be able to afford to, even force the systems and authority figures themselves to change for better in the end? So the story would revolve around that? I know this is a weird question, but this is something of a recurring pet peeve of mine about a lot of shows and games too where I wish some shows handled it like this! The Irregular at Magic High School kinda touches on this idea, but not really.

Thank you all in advance!

Edit: Oh and bonus points if it's available on Crunchy in Europe! Thanks!",False,anime,1707323758.0,1al73qc,What to Watch?

It was on Cartoon Network (mid 90's-early 2000's). All I remember about the show is the characters would touch any kind of matter and it would break it down into different weapons. One guy had glowing spheres that floated around him and would launch at people. Another had a glowing sword that looked like a bar of light. Stuff like that.

"Deaf, HOH, CODA - What do we think about [A Sign of Affection]?","Would love to hear from fellow CODA about [A Sign of Affection] as that's where I fall, but I'd love thoughts from Deaf and HOH as well!

On the one hand, I love all of the Japanese signs, on the other, I feel conflicted about how Itsuomi treats Yuki. I showed my mom and she felt like he was rude to touch her so much and get up in her face, but also loved how he actively wanted to learn her language, and seems to be invested in actively using it with her.

She said Oushi is ""typical over protective hearie."" She could definitely relate to Yuki's family not knowing sign, as my grandparents (while incredibly progressive about it for their time in other areas) also never learned her language. I'd love to hear other opinions!!!

It's always amazing seeing deaf characters in media, I'm really enjoying this show. Big fan of how realistic certain things are. I know nothing about Japanese deaf culture, but I see enough similarities that the show kind of feels like home.",False,anime,1707314670.0,1al3nog,Discussion

"Searching for something light hearted, romance story, slice of life, comedy","Hi guys, this is my anime list: [https://myanimelist.net/profile/perrycotto](https://myanimelist.net/profile/perrycotto)

Refently I saturated my favourite anime to watch and currently I‘ve binged Frieren both anime and manga, I have to say that i absolutely didn’t thought it could hook me so much, the animation is superb, character are well designed and their chemistry is great, I especially love how well it balances action, adventure and [Iyashikei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iyashikei)  vibes.

I‘ve taken this example because it encompass very well what I search in anime, something that is visually appealing (mushishi, mob psycho, bungou stray dogs, vivy fluorite song, nichijou, berserk the old one, ghost in the shell); has a solid engaging story that isn’t predictable unlike anime such as Black Clover or Shield Hero (my brain still hurts); has a certain level of attention for soundtrack and music (i don’t expect something as vivy fluorite, beck or the amazing Takt Op.).   


You will see that i’m missing a lot of classics like Code Geass but I really can’t stand that style of animation and sadly for me it’s a deal breaker even if the anime is good. I‘m not expecting bones, madhouse or mbappa level of animation every single episode, hell I’ve enjoyed Pop team epic, inferno cop and other weird anime because of their creativity and smart use of simple animation to deliver great story or great action / funny scenes. 

While i’ve said that i enjoy the [Iyashikei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iyashikei) genre I tend to get bored quickly as my level of attention has been dramatically abused by the fast paced and action packed genre. Masterpieces as Mushishi of Aria are surely great but I consume them very slowly and occasionally. 

Ideally I would search something with the story of Fruit Basket, the animation that can span from Great Teacher Onizuka (one of my favourite of all time, I’ve read everything from the author) to the much modern Heavenly Delusion (which was sadly a delusion), the comedy of Nichijou, Full Metal Panic or Golden Boy or Love is war.

I’m aware of great suggestions such as Yuru Camp, Place further than the universe, Toradora, Wonder Egg Priority, The Melancholy of... etc but for now i’m searching something else. 

I’m more than open to other suggestions of other genre the only condition is that i’m asking you your really favourite and best and most emotional anime the you hold dear.

thanks everyone !

New to Anime and I need Suggestions,"I’ve seen AoT, Cyberpunk, Castlevania & Nocturne Isles, Naruto, and I’m currently watching JJK. I loved all of them, with AoT being my favorite of the bunch. 

I want to get into Anime more and I need some suggestions based on my preferences: 
- As you can tell from my list, I definitely lean towards action, but I am willing to watch a show with less action if the story is that good. 
- I prefer cool lore & world-building over anything else. 
- Please don’t roast me for this one, but I don’t like when most of the characters or the MC look like literal children, but are adults, it really throws me off. If just a couple characters are like that, then it’s fine.

Should I watch oshi no ko?,"I've been a fan of manga/anime since I was a little kid & I'm 30 now. Still, I try to avoid animes with female characters who try to be cute so I tend to just watch fighting ones with a male mc. I tried watching oshi no ko ep 1, but couldn't finish it. I could feel my interest leaving my body with each second. However, I've been humbled many times when judging manga/anime for their first ep/chapter. Since this series is so popular, does it get better? Will it get dark and serious? Is the mc's charm just being aloof & 'cute'? Is it only popular because the fanbase is made up of mostly male viewers? I've heard that it's one of the animes with the best 1st ep, but I felt like it got more and more boring with each second. Please tell me, should I watch this & endure? If yes, why? What's so good about it? (NO SPOILERS.)",False,anime,1708427276.0,1avf4ya,Help

Looking for a tall girl x short boy anime name,"The show came around with Komi doesn’t communicate and The Dangers in my Heart I think. Could be H, or not. I’m pretty sure the setting was in school. And the girl could be a gyaru. Nevertheless her inner monologue was bubbly. 

I remember when the girl first sees the boy she gets real flustered and thinks something like ‘oh crap, this is bad, I wanna bone him!’ And he thinks the same thing. They might be the same age? But the boy was really short. I’m not sure what else happens in the episode but that stuck on my mind clearly.

I don’t remember the name and after watching The Dangers in my heart I gotta see if this one is as wholesome too. ",False,anime,1708426249.0,1avevac,Help

What are the weirdest interpretations or fallacies you've heard about your favorite shows?,"
We've all seen some very strange interpretations or claims about different anime shows...from popular shows like Naruto to Jujutsu Kaisen to Attack on Titan to One Piece and so forth...that you sometimes shake your head and wonder how people came up with these.

I'll start:

JUJUTSU KAISEN:

""The power system in Jujutsu Kaisen makes no sense"" - No, it makes sense. Everything form domain expansion to innate domain to domain amplification to simple domain and so forth is properly explained in the show. If you don't understand an explanation simply rewind and rewatch the scene till you get it


NARUTO:

""Naruto became bad or should have ended after the Pain arc"" - No it shouldn't. A lot of plot points remained unsolved. Even neverminding the inconsistencies of the war arc, after the Pain arc we still had good arcs like the 5 Kage submit, the Naruto training with Killer Bee and taming the 9 tails. Even the war arc had some 10/10 moments and some poor moments too...


ATTACK ON TITAN:

[Attack on Titan spoilers] >!""Eren became a bird"" - 😂😂😂 I still laugh anytime I see this. I'm still not sure if they're trolling or being serious. Literally the most basic symbolism in the show to show that Eren became free in death and is watching over his friends suddenly gets interpreted as Eren became a bird...wtf!<


[Attack on Titan spoilers] >!""Eren doesn't know why he did the Rumbling"" - I wonder what he was saying to Armin the entire conversation then. Imagine having an entire 10 minutes worth of conversation explaining about 4 different reasons for the Rumbling...and then someone misinterpretes a random line where he talks about not understanding the reason his nature is one that seeks freedom...How TF do you ignore 10 minutes worth of dialogue and come up with this?!<

""Attack on Titan should have ended after the basement reveal"" - No it shouldn't. Season 4 was literally the best season storywise. Just because you don't like the change in genre doesn't render the whole story pointless


ONE PIECE:

""One Piece gets good after 200+ episodes"" - No that's false. One piece is good from the start. It only gets better and better. You don't need 200 episodes for it to get good.",False,anime,1708423447.0,1ave65b,Discussion

"I just saw this ""strongest isekai characters so far in 2024"" ranking and omg it couldn't be more wrong...","So, there's five people on the list. Yogiri from Sokushi Cheat..., Usato from Chiyuu Mahou no Machigatta Tsuikata, Yumiella from Ura Boss Level 99, Misumi from TsukiMichi, and the protagonist if Ishura. I'm seeing all of these except Ishura (sorry I forgot the dudes name). The ranking I saw, from 1st to 5th, goes like this. Yogiri>Soujiro>Misumi>Usato>Yumiella.

I get Yogiri topping them all. He's insanely OP with that ability of his. I maybe get Misumi being above Yumiella, he's also pretty damn OP. But HOW do you put USATO over Yumiella??? Like, bruh, Yumiella's magic is insanely destructive and she herself is stronger than Rose (physically speaking), and if you say Usato has healing? Yumiella can grow back an arm!! She's also good at using it on others!! Removing the Ishura guy, I'd rank them Yogiri>Yumiella, Misumi (they're pretty even matched imo)>Usato.

Why does fanservice on male characters make them look so cool?,"Since I've started watching Solo Levelling, I cannot help but feel like the MC of the show has some of the coolest glow-ups that I have seen in a while. After he gained some muscle through rigorous training, I saw plenty of close-up ab shots of his body to show how far he had changed physically from the first episode to the latest episode . Those scenes make him look extremely cool.

When some of my favorite male characters do sexually suggestive poses voluntarily, it does give me genuine excitement which I don't get from boob/butt fanservice of female characters. Is it just me who falls into this experience when it comes to fanservice?

- Something with complex social, psychological, or gripping themes 
- Not something that has like 100 or more episodes. Something realistic I can finish! This was a huge bonus finding out Death Note only has 37 episodes.

The scene started with a soldier on a battlefield and everyone is dead. He hears an enemy giant talking and the giant tells him something along the lines of “you’ve beaten us now something even worse will come for you” he kills the giant and then hears a woman talking it’s his commander and she’s dying propped up against a rock. They talk and she says something about she’s failed again and then an angel appears and hurls magic at them about to kill the two and she leans in and spits a marble into his mouth. 

Then the clip ended. If anyone can identify it and let me know if it’s worth the time thank you.

Anime with guns and a blue creature?,"I woke up today suddenly thinking of an anime that I used to watch as a kid. The main character used a gun like device and inputted certain “cartridges” or something into the “gun” and shot it at creatures to evolve them? He had a blue colored cat/dog kind of creature thing that could speak and it was like his friend or something, he possibly had a red gem in the middle of its head but I may be wrong about that. I would really appreciate if someone could tell me what anime I’m thinking about.

Looking for an anime movie for 10 years now,"Hi I created this account only because I’m very desperate. I watched this movie on YouTube when there was no copyright moderation about anime on the platform and I only have blurry memories. The graphics were great and not in an old style like ""Perfect Blue"" but more like ""When Marnie was there"". 

The scenario unfolded in a futuristic Japan where everyone had some kind of system in the head that prevented any kind of trauma (like if someone bleed they won’t be able to see clearly and their vision will be blurred or glitched). Then an unknown organization hacks the system and triggers a wave of su!c!dal and hyper violent behavior among everyone. 
We’re following the pov of a japanese girl who lost her best friend an european girl (maybe russian) in a double su!c!de (in high school) where she was the only one to escape because she didn’t take enough medecine (she feels very bad about that because she was in love with her bff) 
She seeks to discover who is behind the massive hack and realize that it is her bff who didn’t died and wants everyone being traumatized because in her childhood in Russia (not sure) she’s been rape and torture by soldiers. 
I don’t remember the end but I remember a scene where a friend of the main character sticks a fork in her eyes because of the hack while they’re brunch. 

This movie really triggers me at the time but I really want to rewatch it so thank you if you help me and sorry for my English it’s not my main language. Have a nice day you all who read this :)",False,anime,1708398382.0,1av76up,Help

Crest and Banner of the Stars 25th Anniversary Rewatch Announcement,"# Crest / Banner of the Stars &mdash; Seikai no Senki 25th Anniversary Rewatch Announcement

I will be starting the first of two 1999 sci-fi rewatches in mid-march: the romance / war epic series Banner of the Stars! In one sentence, I would summarize it as Spice and Wolf crossed with Legend of Galactic Heroes.  After several centuries of disjointed colonization and the rise and fall of petty empires, the galaxy has become divided into 5 major powers, who are in the process of annexing the last remaining independent systems.  Major conflict is inevitable.

Seikai no Senki, aka Banner (or Battleflag) of the Stars, is a light novel series by Hiroyuki Morioka. As a contrast to 1990s epic Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Banner of the Stars remains focused on a particular pair of participants: Lafiel Abriel and Jinto Lyn.  The existing animated materials follows them from their meeting, through a number of campaigns in intergalactic war, and wrapping up at a nice stopping point with an epilogue / coda.

The series is also notable for its extensive world building.  Unfortunately, not much translated material, mostly hosted on fansites, remains after 20 years. As anime-only viewers, we are limited to what the show presents to us. However, if world building is your thing, are rabbit holes to follow: the Abh nation, history and culture, the physics of interstellar travel, and Morioka's constructed language of Baronh.

The first series, Crest of the Stars, was shown on G4/Tech TV and was very popular in North America, leading to Bandai making and releasing two additional 1 cour adaptations.  Tokyopop picked up the light novels, but tokyopop being tokyopop, didn't follow through. (Hey! I did my part! I bought my copy!) This would have been our best record of the background details.  I hope source readers will pop in with details not in the anime.

This show has something for everyone!  However, if you're looking for just one thing, the show many seem unfocused. By the time we get to the second season, we have a vastly expanded cast.  We have exciting battles in space! But throughout it all, we also have extended conversations between two or three people.  The show is very talky.  In some ways, it's a well animated radio drama.  (I have several such CDs. They are much like a condensed audio track of the TV series!)  Ultimately, the show is focused on the characters and not the greater events. And yes, [there is a couple.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oSIr4r9Cv4)

This will be my first rewatch in quite some time.  I will provide extras from my DVDs where applicable, although so far they seem to be basic details already presented in the anime itself (and somewhat prematurely).

I'm also not one for long series and long rewatches, but this one is worth it. I had only intended to run a rewatch of the first cour, from 1999, but somebody in the interest thread asked about the others.  My two responses to this were, ""why not"" and ""why wait""?  We should watch it all in one batch.  The entire series runs 39 episodes.  Here is how it breaks down:

###Rewatch Dates:
March 18 - April 30

###Series Discussion:
April 30

###Posting Schedule
Index tables will be in the reminder thread.  As a gift to our European friends, I will attempt a **2 pm PDT** posting time, as allowed by my working schedule (previously I was posting at 3 pm). The USA will be on daylight saving time after March 10.  That is 9 pm UTC, and 10 pm CET. I think I'll wait until March to figure out the Australian time.

###Availability

Banner of the Stars was re-licensed by Funimation after the closure of Bandai Entertainment, so Crunchyroll is probably the go-to place for streaming.  No promises that Funimation will still be streaming in March.

* [Crunchyroll Franchise Link](https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GVDHX8QXW/crest-of-the-stars)
* [Funimation Franchise Link](https://www.funimation.com/shows/crest-of-the-stars-/?qid=)
* [Amazon Season 1](https://www.amazon.com/Crest-of-the-Stars/dp/B07KMKDSVD) (marked as unavailable to me)

Crunchy and Funi mark the OVA as a prequel and slot it first into season 1...it is best watched after the first season.  Since it is a side story, I've moved it to the otherwise anemic season 4 discussion.

Thanks to Vaadwaur for suggesting the start date, it works nicely.

"Anyone else think Revenger (2023) took the easy way out, instead of being a truly good anime?","I don't really see this one being talked about a lot, but the show is quite solid. And yet, my only problem (which unfortunately is a big one) is on the Revengers' philosophy. 

There are pretty much three ways to see what ribenjis are doing:

1) Coins are sacred. We are God's men, and it is our duty to satisfy His children's grudges, and take on their sins.

2) This is literally a formality, all I care about is being paid and to look cool while doing it.

3) Revenge is wrong. People can change, if given the chance.

None of these views can coexist. It's fine to progress from one to another (Soji), but believing whatever is convenient at the time will not suffice.

However, that's exactly what the show does at the end. There is no correct answer to the question ""What to do with Kurima Raizo?"". You either honour Yui's pain and hatred and kill Raizo (1). Or kill Raizo cause you were paid and don't care much more than that (2). Or decide to spare Raizo because he repented, and decide to ignore the church (3).

And yet, the show decides ""It'll be fine"" and says ideas 1 and 3 can coexist. Spare Raizo, spit in the face of Yui's hatred because they believe he changed and repented, and that the church is wrong. But also keep working for the church because the hatred embedded on the coins is sacred. 

And they do this throughout the show. White-hair dude seems like the most devout worshipper out of all of them, and yet he's happy to shield Raizo on his own discretion, lie to the church and so on. Sometimes the gang will accept that a coin is just a coin and it doesn't matter who bit it, sometimes they'll say the grudge matters and using a loophole to have a random guy bite the coin so they have an excuse to serve revenge is wrong.

Instead of making the characters face a tough choice, they get away with not having to make any. Some random kid kills Raizo, and I guess there's that. ""What goes around comes around"" what a sick joke. The gang keeps doing revenges as though nothing happened, promising to never 'cheat like this again' (??? it doesn't work that way).

Such a bafflingly half-assed solution to a fascinatingly well crafted premise. It's like they knew what they were supposed to do without understanding why they were supposed to do it. It's not over whether Raizo survives or not, it's whether the characters decide Revenge is right or not.",False,anime,1708379882.0,1auzzz6,Discussion

Define Initial D for me.,"Preface: I'm picky. I can only find 1 or 2 anime that will actually appeal to me per year. I can't sit through the hypertropey stuff with 1 dimensional characters.

I like JDM cars and the culture around them. One thing g that keeps coming up again and again in that scene is how many people watched and were inspired by initial D.

Does it hold up? Is it choked with melodrama and poor character design? Does it suffer from DBZ-itis with scenes that should've been 30 seconds dragging out for entire episodes?

Recommendations for my son and I (new to the genre),"I have a son (15) who I think would enjoy anime movies/shows but hasn't really ever been into watching TV or movies (at least not since being a little kid, once he discovered video games he was on that path pretty much alone). I am hoping to get some recommendations for anime that we could watch together and see if he likes. 

In general he likes Japanese culture so I think it will be a good fit... but admittedly a lot of that is because of his love of the food. He loves RPG video games, but primarily western ones so far (he doesn't like turn based stuff as much yet so I might try and see if he likes some action RPG ones), for example, anything Bethesda Game Studio. In the past he did love Ni No Kuni and has played pretty much all the Pokémon games (but not as much lately) as well as the Zelda games.

When he was into Ni No Kuni I had him watch a couple of the Studio Ghibli films with me and they were ok for him, but I think he was a little young still at that point. I could try again.

I watched some back in the day, like the older Studio Ghibli stuff before the early 2000s and things like Vampire Hunter D and (I think it was called) Record of Lodoss War, but it has been a long time.

Gushing over Magical Girls is well-written,"Tl;dr in advance: Don't judge a book by it's cover. 

Ever since Gushing over Magical Girls - or Mahou Shoujo ni Akogarete - started airing, it has been the subject of many heated discussions, but I've seen one take about this show that I consider to be wrong and that is: ""This anime is just porn. It's not well written and people only like it because it's ecchi.""

First of all, no, this anime is not ""just porn"". Aside from the ecchi content there is a lot to like about it. Whether it's the story, the characters, the themes, the comedy, the voice acting or the fun subversion of the magical girl genre and it's tropes, Gushing over Magical Girls has a lot of good things to offer, but I want to focus on the writing in particular, specifically the character writing, which is usually the first aspect fans of the series mention when they talk about what they enjoy about Mahoako. 

The term ""well written"" is pretty vague, but I'd say a character is generally well written when they are:

* **consistent and believable**, meaning their actions make sense in the context of how the character was previously established. If a character has clearly established beliefs, goals or motivations, then their actions have to align with those or the character won't feel believable or ""real"". 
* **invoke emotions in us**, whether it's love, hate or more conflicted feelings, if a character makes us care about them, I think it's a strong sign that they are well written. 
* **serving the story they are in**, meaning they fit into the story and make it more engaging for the viewer. They don't necessarily have to have depth or complex motivations. If the character fits into the story and if their presence and interactions improve the work they're in, then I think that's another sign of them being well written. 
* **relatable**, meaning we can look at them and see at least some part of ourselves in them or find some traits of them relatable, whether they are good or bad. I think this point is more important for the protagonist of a story and not a requirement for every character to be considered well written.

The characters in Gushing over Magical Girls fulfill all of these criteria. They are all interesting and engaging and their dynamics are enjoyable. All of them have clear, discernible traits, such as strengths, weaknesses and personalities that define them well. And the main character Utena isn't just consistent, entertaining and relatable, but she also has layers, meaning she isn't one-dimensional and more than just a sadist who likes to humiliate Magical Girls. The latest episode, episode 7, presented her complexity as a character very well. 

And even though the story is mostly character-driven and the beginning is episodic, there is also a good plot and even some intrigue about the mascot character and their role in the story. There are also interesting themes in this anime, like the theme of self-discovery, which the characters are going through when they explore their various kinks. 

And last but not least the comedy is genuinely great too and there are a lot of people who watch and enjoy this anime mainly because it's funny. Writing and executing good comedy is not easy, so the author and the anime staff deserve some credit for making Gushing over Magical Girls as hilarious as it is. 

Now, this should be obvious, but Gushing over Magical Girls is definitely not for everyone and I would never recommend this show to someone who dislikes ecchi or who feels uncomfortable with the premise of the story or it's fetish content. However, just because an anime doesn't appeal to you, doesn't mean it's not well written. There are reasons why this series has become very popular very quickly and it's not just because of the excellent marketing, but also because it's a good ecchi/comedy anime with well written characters. 

What's your opinion? Do you agree or disagree with my take? Also, I know this anime is controversial, but please keep the discussion civil.

Comedy Anime Recommendations ,"I'm a die hard anime fan, and I want to watch anime ALOT. But the thing is there is alot of lackings of comedy anime's WITHOUT romance. I really don't like romance anime recently, because of me being single, it makes my heart hurt very badly, seeing male MC getting girlfriends, getting into a relationship. So, I've stopped watching rom-com for a moment. So i need some recommendations about comedy without romance.

Important Note: the recommended anime's can't be action ones. ",False,anime,1708361394.0,1aurzhy,What to Watch?

The Roboworld people in Redline had a point.,"The bad guys from Roboworld are ugly, macho, and obviously designed to look like cyborg space Nazis. But honestly if a bunch of criminals bring heavy ammunition and into a street race that starts in a DMZ and finishes inside a country's top-secret military base, and livestream the whole thing, they have nobody to blame for themselves for getting blown up.

Roboworld is working on illegal biological weapons tech. But that princess alien from Supergrass showed up on their base and used powerful magic. Supergrass hired criminals to sabotage Roboworld's conventional weapons to protect the illegal race, and sponsored racers, two of whom were their own princesses. Its entirely plausible that the race was intended to spy on or sabotage the Roboworld military while less openly breaching the treaty. Roboworld is not the only one breaking the rules of war, and its understandable to want a trump card under the circumstances.

Whenever Roboworld uses lethal force in the movie, its because terrorists are committing crimes on their sovereign soil and refuse to surrender.

Its probable that they displaced people to force them to live on that crappy Moon DMZ. But the settlers there are just called 'refugees', so they might be from other places. Roboworld did respect that you don't bring weapons or soldiers to the DMZ, until a bunch of criminals sponsored by a rival foreign power broke that rule.

That colonel does beat the shit out of Little Deyzuna. But Little Deyzuna did desert his post to get into a barfight with a deserter without permission. In most militaries throughout real-life history and anime, a few lost teeth would be the least of his worries. He was back at work the next day without a demotion.",False,anime,1708359068.0,1aur08j,Misc.

"Shine the spotlight and give suggestions on animes you think are above average: not the best of its genre, and not the worst to exist, just above average.","I finally caught up to Tsukimichi: Moonlit Fantasy last week and damn it's a fun isekai anime. It's by no means one of the best of its genre like Mushoku Tensei or Re:Zero but its very enjoyable in its own right.

Then I realized that not a lot of people actually talk about this anime. It's unfortunate because it's actually one of the ""above average"" isekais that, while still cliche, is a fun watching experience especially if you're looking for ""OP main character"" isekais without its premise feeling ""overdone"" and ""repetitive"".

On that note, suggest animes you think are above average in quality. It could be that it doesn't do anything new in its genre or doesn't particularly have one shining aspect that makes it stand out above the others, but still are pretty good animes that are ""above average"" in their own right.",False,anime,1708358648.0,1auqtt2,What to Watch?

To find the name of an old anime!!,"**Found :** Its Getbackers

**Little context :** It was around the year 2013 when I got know about an anime. I remember watching one episode (or one incident) and remember it well. I watched the episode in 3pg on a 128x160 screen. I liked the episode but couldn't watch the rest because of lack of internet. Don't know how popular that anime was as I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere for year. 

Here is the episode or incident I remember. 
There were 2 main characters. One with orange hair, orange t-shirt, green half jacket, half green pant and he were gloves. The other character was more simple, black hair, white shirt with simple jeans I guess, and he used to were black glasses. 

They had some super powers. The orange guy was able to generate electricity and hence used to wear gloves. The other had purple eye that can make people hallucinate. 

In the episode, the pair went to a warehouse in their car during the night because some group kidnapped a girl and they were taking shelter there. The orange guy rammed through the door with the punches and they got inside. Then the other guy removed his glasses and made everyone hallucinate that the warehouse was and they were too. This made majority of the enemies unable to move, even the girl was effect. After few mins the effect ware off but till then the orange guy saved the girl. 

That's what I remember. I have the mental image of those characters and will be able to recognize them. So if anyone have any idea please do let me know.",False,anime,1708355215.0,1aupg4g,Help

Finding friends to watch anime with is harder than expected ,"
Hello everyone, this is a bit of a rant but I’m also looking for some advice, so thank you if you’re reading.^^

I love anime & manga, I’ve watched 400+ shows and read 500+ manga/lns. I’m saying this because I want to be clear, I’m not new to anime and I’m pretty familiar with even the more questionable sides of the media.

Thing is, anime isn’t very popular where I live so wile I don’t really hide my liking of it, I don’t go out of my way to talk about it with others. 

I recently thought it’d be cool to make some anime-watching friends in my city so that we could go to stores, cons, and movies together. I joined a group chat that I found on Facebook (Facebook is still very popular here) and man… it was rough… 
Among other things there was a 30+ years old dude sending “memes” of naked lolis; a furry dude writing about his sexual fantasies while sending pictures of his furry-costume; a bunch of dudes making unfunny incelish jokes; a lot of “memes” about women having to stay in the kitchen and about how waifus are better than 3D girls; and when they found out one of the admins was a girl at least 10 dudes shoot the worst shot I’ve seen (asking for pictures of her face to “see if she was real”, sending cringe memes about imagining a future with her, askingfor her top10 anime of all time, etc).

I couldn’t take it anymore and left the group chat, I hate the word cringe but this WAS cringe af. I don’t mind being a weeb and talking about waifus or even hentai, but there’s time and place and most importantly CONTEXT, YOU CANT JUST SEND A NAKED LOLI OUT OF NOWHERE.

It is not directly incest like brother x sister as I'd like but I still liked it. The thing is: I can't seem to find a hentai were the characters don't have huge boobs and everything is pictured kind of gross, I guess is because most hentai is made for men which is understandable, but I just wish to find some good ones that are explicit but not idk super unreal and exaggerated.

In the 80s on Showtime, there was some anime shows on. In one of them, humans could climb into the cockpit of large human-shaped robots. The one I have been hunting for is there was a young man being trained by a grizzled older military veteran. While training the new recruit, there was one scene where the veteran told the trainee, ""Confidence is your greatest ally, but overconfidence is your worst enemy."" 

Not sure if that was an entirely correct quotation,  as I was on the young side when I saw it. I have not found anything using Google, and it's been a little nag trying to find the title of the show.

Looking for Tactical & Strategic Anime Recs without a godlike MC,"I'm looking for some tactical anime recommendations. Examples like:

* World Trigger  -   where everyone's working with the same tools, there's no sudden powerups to beat an enemy, the good guys not infrequently lose; 
* Kingdom        -      a war anime with excellent politics, tactics, and environment usage;
* HunterXHunter - the way nen works and interacts, plus some of the fights;
* Log Horizon   - 	where exact timing is another factor in gaming the system, each class has similar/same skillset, there's a smart MC but he's hardly the only one;
* Weak Hero     -      not an anime/manga per se, but a fighting webtoon where the weak MC uses tools to get around his lack of strength and his allies/enemies are frequently just as strong or stronger than he is;

More anime (not including above) that I've seen that kinda sorta fit this pattern: One Piece \[pre-timeskip\], Haikyuu, Hikaru no Go, Promised Neverland S1, Boku no Hero Academia \[ignoring later seasons\], Jojo Stone Ocean

Some things I really would prefer not to watch: Overpowered MC who beats everyone by breathing, whether in brains or brawn (or both). Even if the MC starts out weak, if they end up with more power than God by the last episode of the season, \*especially\* if everyone around them doesn't level up as well, it kind of ends up being boring in my book. Truly and completely boring. Unless it's One Punch Man. That guy rocks.

TL;DR -  I'm a huge fan of smart and strong ensemble casts, where strong internal (sometimes magical) rules have been created and both enemies and allies attempt to use those same rules, bend them, and/or think outside the box.

Trigun - Anime of the Week,"Welcome to the weekly Anime of the Week Discussion Thread! Each week, we're here to discuss various older anime series. Today we are discussing...

## Trigun

Vash the Stampede is the man with a $$60,000,000,000 bounty on his head. The reason: he's a merciless villain who lays waste to all those that oppose him and flattens entire cities for fun, garnering him the title ""The Humanoid Typhoon."" He leaves a trail of death and destruction wherever he goes, and anyone can count themselves dead if they so much as make eye contact—or so the rumors say. In actuality, Vash is a huge softie who claims to have never taken a life and avoids violence at all costs.

With his crazy doughnut obsession and buffoonish attitude in tow, Vash traverses the wasteland of the planet Gunsmoke, all the while followed by two insurance agents, Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, who attempt to minimize his impact on the public. But soon, their misadventures evolve into life-or-death situations as a group of legendary assassins are summoned to bring about suffering to the trio. Vash's agonizing past will be unraveled and his morality and principles pushed to the breaking point.

[What's up, r/anime?](#michaelwink) 

I’ve wanted to host a rewatch for this series pretty much since I first watched it, but put it aside as a “save for when a sequel is announced” sort of thing. Well, [a sequel *was* finally announced last month](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/192ai0e/dorohedoro_sequel_anime_announced/), and the only reason I didn’t jump on this *sooner* is because I was in the middle of hosting my Gundam Build rewatch at the time. 

Now that my schedule’s clear, it’s time to put that dream into motion!

[](#rengehype)

#***What is Dorohedoro?***

>Caiman is a person who has lost all of his memories after being transformed into a lizard-headed man by a sorcerer. Living in a grim urban region called Hole, he now hunts magic users in search of the one responsible for his metamorphosis in an attempt to recover his past and his face. Extremely strong and immune to magic, he has the help of his best friend, Nikaido. She is an agile fighter who runs a small restaurant at Hole. Their continuous slaughter of magicians calls the attention of a powerful sorcerer named En. He has his two best hitmen, Shin and Noi, target the lizard-man and his ally. As Caiman delves deep into the search for his former identity, he starts acquiring odd clues that lead him into the bizarre magic world.

[Dorohedoro](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38668/Dorohedoro) is a 12-episode horror/comedy/action series from [Studio MAPPA](https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/569/MAPPA), and when I say “comedy”, I mean this show is fucking *wild* from start to finish, and I assume it only gets crazier in the source material past where this leaves off. My go-to example of how wild this show can be is [the third ED](https://v.animethemes.moe/Dorohedoro-ED3.webm) (oh yeah, this series has *six* EDs despite having only twelve episodes, with all of them + the OP being from [(K)NoW_NAME](https://myanimelist.net/people/42050/KNoW_NAME)) because, I mean, just *watch* it. 

If you’re interested in having a fun time, now’s better than ever to hop on the Dorohedoro train if you haven’t already!

#***Wait, what even IS a rewatch?***

Rewatches on this sub are effectively the weekly airing discussion threads, but for older shows and usually paced at one-per-day rather than one-per-week. These are open to both people who haven’t seen the show before as well as those who have – any discussion of events past that day’s given episode *must* be spoiler tagged [using r/anime’s spoiler tag format](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/q28ulr/announcing_changes_to_spoiler_tags/), so as to not ruin the first-timers’ experience. Reading their reactions or having those reactions yourself is half the fun of a rewatch, you know? 

As an example of what to do if you’re too lazy to click on that link:

    [Dorohedoro]>!I want to eat gyoza.!<

Becomes [Dorohedoro]>!I want to eat gyoza.!< when you don’t break the formatting on purpose like I just did.

As for how to participate, just pick whatever you’re comfortable with. Some people do bullet point live reactions, some people write essays, some just show up to share memes or fanart and then dip, some solely respond to other participants rather than having a top-level comment on their own – anything goes as long as you’re not being rude! 

So, plan ahead on what you’re going to do, watch the episodes each day on your own, and be ready to jump in any time after the threads get posted!

#***What’s the schedule?***

The plan is for the rewatch to start a month from now on **March 18th**, with a thread for the specials on March 30th and the overall discussion thread on March 31st. I intend to post the threads each day at **6 pm ET**, the same time I posted this discussion thread (although depending on your timezone, it might be a *little* different when the rewatch starts since Daylight Savings hits mine on March 10th).

#***I’m in, where can I watch this show?***

Dorohedoro is available for streaming on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80991903), including the specials! Those are listed as “Episode 13 (OVA)”.

I look forward to eating gyoza with you all in a month!

Ping Pong The Animation 10th Anniversary Rewatch - Announcement,"[_Enter the hero! Enter the hero! Enter the hero!_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v6iOVhw6mQ)

### Intro

Hi everyone! There was an amazing response to my [interest thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1atc6xj/) yesterday so this thread serves to officially announce the Ping Pong the Animation rewatch!

Based on some feedback I got yesterday I've decided to adjust the thread times to be a little later so it's more convenient. Now the plan is to post at **2pm PDT (5pm EDT, 9pm UTC)**. The interest thread didn't actually account for US daylight savings time yesterday, but I think the conversions are correct now. If you live in a different time zone here's a [handy converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20240411T210000&p1=tz_pt).

There was also enough interest to include Tekkon Kinkreet as part of the rewatch so I've confirmed it into the schedule. That said, I couldn't find any legal streams for it. I think the Blu-ray / DVD is available on Amazon (a mix of new and used options). If you do know of any legal streams please let me know. Otherwise...

The rewatch is still a little while away, so I'll post a one week reminder on April 4 and a one day reminder on April 10.

To any lurkers or people who missed the thread yesterday, don't feel as though you need to sign up to participate. We'd be happy to have you as part of the rewatch even if you don't or only occasionally comment. Ping Pong the Animation is definitely an anime worth watching regardless.

Until then, everyone take care of yourselves!

Anime That Share A Specific Element With Frieren,"I have been having trouble finding more anime to watch as of late so I took a break for a couple months and am in the mood to watch some more shows. What oftentimes makes it a chore for me to find new anime are things like excessive fanservice, female characters being written poorly, generic main characters/characters in general, and repetitive plots. Frieren is a breath of fresh air as while the world itself is typical medieval fantasy, the characters are just so much fun to watch. The way the cast bounce off each other throughout their journey makes for some of the best television I've seen in a while! I am looking for more shows that feature characters with great chemistry with a well paced plot that is serialized. Some examples besides Frieren are: Record Of Lodoss War, The Legend Of Vox Machina, Avatar The Last Airbender, The Owl House, The Vision Of Escaflowne, Magic Knight Rayearth, and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. These are also just some fantastic shows in general so send some suggestions my way!",False,anime,1708290392.0,1au4uyd,What to Watch?
Why you should watch School Days,"I just recently rewatched it for a second time and feel like I had to speak out about it.

First of all, im bias because its my favorite romance ever but I learned recently that there’s a common opinion on the internet that it’s so bad that its only good for tricking your friends into watching it.

I’m also bias in a sense that I first watched it when I must have like 14, which has to be the real target audience. It’s a little dated and deserves critique for its cringe fan service camera shots, but it’s mostly only prevalent near the beginning and you can ignore it as it gets more plot focused very soon and stays that way till the end.

With that out the way here’s why you should watch it:

- Very short. Only 12 episodes long. Easy to follow. Unforgettable, even if you don’t end up enjoying it. The ending is famous and because it’s getting old, there’s plenty of new anime fans who don’t know about it and I think should.

- Very unique for what you get. Don’t you love anime that makes you feel? Anime that makes you cry hard? Feel hype af? Well School Days makes you feel anger, and I think it takes not only a unique motivation to want to make your audience feel that way but also takes a special talent to pull it off.

- Some like to watch anime like Overlord, Death Note, and Saga of Tanya the Evil because it does something different and the protagonist plays a villain type role. Well School Days is a romance that looks at other romance like Your Name or maybe Toradora and goes the opposite of that cute route and shows you that sometimes romance can also be really ugly.

- Some like Bocci the Rock, or maybe Komi-San Can’t Communicate because it’s the cute type of cringe people like to relate to. Well School Days will bring back that ugly cringe you wish to forget but keeps you up at night once you remember that thing you did. That might sound like a weird reason to recommend this show, but whether you relate or don’t, it’s the truth that teenagers are actually really dumb and the show uses this as a premise and takes it to the extreme so well! 

I’d love to discuss what people think of the show too! Just mark your spoilers so we don’t ruin it for anyone looking to try the show now ^^

EDIT: Apparently the anime doesn’t cover everything and the visual novels are even better. Thanks for the recs! Anime is probably still worth it imo",False,anime,1708290366.0,1au4ulf,Discussion

Friends and/or romance in School or Work,"Just like a tittle.

I'm looking for an anime about friends just hanging out with each other or some cool romance.

Preferably it would be during school time but it could be at work too.

If it's possible I'd like to just give two points I don't like.

* Annoying characters like Taiga from Toradora (I don't mean Tsundere, I mean the girl who blames and attacks the main character for things he didn't do. E.g., like some girl hugs him or accidentally sees her underwear. Well that girl's fault)
* Without the MC who is a soft noodle. I mean where he doesn't run away at the sight of underwear and especially when a girl touches his hand. I understand that I gave school times where this may be normal, but maybe school times during high school, not elementary or middle school.

btw prefer without drama, at least without BIG DRAMA, small is accetable.

Edit 1. Prefer anime like 2015+ (maybe 2010+), i dont like old graphics

What's the weirdest or funniest plot you've ever seen in a anime? (short synopsis would be appreciated!)

To me personally it's probably ""Akikan!"". Remember watching it with a couple of friends and a lot of beer back in 2009/2010, had a great time! Here's the synopsis from MyAnimeList, I don't think i have to tell you why I love everything about it:

""Hobbies are often a great way of meeting new people, but how could  Kakeru Daichi, who collects rare juice cans, have ever suspected that  he'd meet a fascinating new girl when he attempted to DRINK her? Naming  her Melon, because she's got great melon... soda, Kakeru quickly learns  that she's an Akikan—a beautiful girl who's also a special can created  to fight other Akikans in a strange experiment to determine what kind of  container is better: steel or aluminum! Will becoming involved in this ridiculously twisted research project gone amuck complicate Kakeru's life incredibly? Of course it will, but  because Melon's steel body needs carbon dioxide to breathe, he's now  stuck with her since she's too CO2 dependent! And when his wealthy,  attractive, best childhood friend Najimi gets HER own aluminum Akikan,  the trouble really begins!""

Help me figure out the name of this anime ,When I was a kid I remember watching this one anime. The main Character was a little girl who had a magical wand w/ a streamer at the end that would turn her into a grown woman. I believe she’d turn into a superhero and go on her missions then when she’s done she would turn herself back into a kid. Other details I remember were that there was some type of tragedy in the the beginning. Like a plane crash and the parents of that young girl were on that plane I think. She also had these cute little animal friends that followed her around. This was soooooooooo long ago so it’s an older anime. I’d say about 90s or early 2000s ,False,anime,1708285799.0,1au2ym5,Help

"What Have You Watched This Past Week That is NOT a Currently Airing Show?

With regards to Fall 2023 shows, however, it would be fine to write about them as long as you only began them after they finished airing. For example, it's fine to talk about watching **The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You** or **Arknights: Perish in Frost** if you started them after the final episode aired. Obviously, use your best judgement on this.

Who's your ideal anime boyfriend?,"Anime fans often find themselves drawn to **shoujo stories** filled with **romantic clichés** that evoke feelings of excitement and giddiness. These stories frequently feature **handsome male characters** who embody ideal boyfriend qualities.

While the anime world offers a vast pool of potential anime boyfriends, only a select few truly resonate with individual preferences. These characters may be prominent figures or prefer to stay in the background, but they all contribute to the abundance of desirable anime boyfriends that viewers can't help but wish for in real life.

What in the world happened with Horimiya?,"Just finished it last night. Disjointed is the best word I could use to describe my experience with the show. Episodes 1-7 had me locked in with Hori and Miyamura's relationship. Mature, genuine, funny, and emotional. Then they become side characters, we see more SOL fluff of people we really don't care too much about, and the pacing is just light speed. It's not God of High School bad, but it sure isn't up to par either. I thought this had a shot to break into my top 5-10 Romance/Drama/RomCom series with the start, but that quickly blew up in smoke.

Can anyone spoil me on if Horimiya: The Missing Pieces has any more worthwhile relationship moments for the main couple? If it is just rotational SOL scenes for every character, I will probably put in on hold for a while. 

Is it still worth watching? Yes. The first 7 episodes are at least. I just don't understand why we were robbed of a 2 cour timeline for this show. SO much more room for it to breathe would've done wonders. Granted I'm an anime only, so maybe manga readers have a different outlook or can share some insight on this.",False,anime,1708279234.0,1au096z,Discussion

Watch Guide for Ranking of Kings + The Treasure Chest of Courage,"Ranking of Kings (ROK) is a great anime with great and multifaceted characters, a complex story and a unique art style. The anime is based on the manga of the same name, although some content has not been adapted. The Treasure Chest of Courage (TCC), which was released in 2023, is a collection of mini-stories from the manga as well as anime canon stories that were shortened or omitted in the adaptation. Each episode consists of up to three mini-stories. Most of them are really not of great importance and rather insignificant.

Still, there were mini-stories and two whole episodes that I think were important and definitely helped me understand the characters better and fill in the gap at the end of the story.

I have therefore created a Watch Order of when you could watch which of the mini-stories from The Treasure Chest of Courage (at the earliest). If an episode has several mini-stories, the following numbering applies: 5.1 corresponds to the first mini-story in episode 5, 5.2 corresponds to the second mini-story in episode 5 and 5.3 corresponds to the third mini-story in episode 5. I have also highlighted the TCC mini-stories that you should check out!

\------------------------------------

* ROK 1-2
* **TCC 8.1 \[01:50 - 09:26\]**
* ROK 3-4
* TCC 5.3 \[16:39 - 21:19\]
* ROK 5-7
* TCC 1
* ROK 8
* **TCC 8.2 \[09:32 - 21:19\]**
* ROK 9-10
* **TCC 7.1 \[01:50 - 12:20\]**
* ROK 11
* TCC 2-3
* ROK 12
* TCC 5.2 \[12:57 - 16:34\]
* ROK 13-17
* **TCC 4, 5.1 \[01:50 - 12:51\]**
* ROK 18-23
* TCC 6, 9, 7.2 \[12:25 - 21:19\]
* **TCC 10**

\------------------------------------

But if you want to avoid stopping in the middle of the episode (at least almost), and you don't want to be pulled out of the plot too much, this would be my recommended Watch Order:

\------------------------------------

* ROK 1-8
* TCC 8
* ROK 9-10
* TCC 7.1 \[01:50 - 12:20\]
* ROK 11-17
* TCC 4, 5.1 \[01:50 - 12:51\] (5.2 and 5.3 can be watched too)
* ROK 18-23
* TCC 10
* Everything else

\------------------------------------

**The only problem is that**

1. **the Intro \[00:00 - 00:20\],**
2. **the Opening \[00:20 - 01:50\] and**
3. **the Ending \[21:19 - 22:49\]**

**of The Treasure Chest of Courage are spoiling the end of the story**, both with subtitles and with its images. And for some episodes there is the problem that only the first mini-story should be watched, because the following one is a mini-story that takes place much later and thus spoils everything.

**To avoid the problem**, I have given the time stamps very precisely. I hope that this will help.

I hope that I was able to give a few people a slightly better watch experience of Ranking of Kings.",False,anime,1708277636.0,1atzlt1,Discussion

Anime similar to Kusuriya no Hitorigoto,"This one has really caught my interest in ways I didn't expect as it's just a niche story disregarding all the wars and bigger conflicts going on outside the walls.

I love the setting and ost. The romance is very subtle, there are unexpected comedic moments as well which is great. I saw some comparisons to Kaichou wa Maid-Sama which I also enjoyed. 

If anyone can recommend similar, please let me know. Can also be chinese historical setting in general as long as political intrigues are the focus and not so much the battlefield.",False,anime,1708272040.0,1atxc3m,What to Watch?

I saw this anime in my dream and i want to ckeck if its actually real," 

The title is pretty self explanatory, but it's the second time I've seen this anime in my dream and I got too curious.

So the art style was very Neon Genesis Evangelion-esque, and it was about two guys, one I'm positive was named Hannibal (inspired by Hannibal Lecter, not Barca) but again I am not completely sure, and I don't remember the other guy's name. I'm sure that they had a romantic/sexual relationship, I believe that's what the anime was even about. I don't remember any of the plot, I just have pictures and faded clips, buy I'm 100% sure that it was like a dark romance BL kind of thing. It was pretty dark in general, most of the clips I remember are literally in absolute darkness or candlelight, but the other clips I remember are pink? I distinctly remember scenes with baby pink as their dominant color. I think the government is also involved in the plot one way or the other, the first episode actually started in like government head quarters or something. Generally, it was a serious anime, it wasn't comedic in the slightest. I know this sound a lot like NBC Hannibal, but I SWEAR it had a different plot; no cannibalism was involved. 

I don't recall looking it up after my first dream, but i find it suspicious that I saw it a second time. My dreams never make sense and perhaps this is my brain fusing media together and I'm tripping. Though Im almost certain that something similar to this exists. 🤷🏻‍♀️",False,anime,1708265029.0,1atusnm,Help

Why are people outside Japan so against classifying anime by the Japanese imperial eras?,"I actually had a discussion with a Japanese friend on how anime is classified in Japan after one person replied this to me as i want to see how a Japanese person thinks of anime being classified by the Japanese imperial periods and he told me that in Japan, most people classify anime by the Japanese Imperial era, and this guy thinks it's NOT an anime era and is not OK when clearly the Japanese people classify anime by Showa, Heisei and Reiwa and he also told me that the ""Gaijin"" way of classifying it is not wrong, but not correct at the same time

Not exactly looking for sci-fi/dystopian just honestly anything that has a similar art style/feel would be nice, but I'd totally love some more Japanese sci-fi.

Id like them to be movies because I kinda don't have the time to really watch full on shows but please also send some series if you think they're worth it!

Thank you<3

Edit: Also I forgot to add this but I'd prefer it if the animes had English dub. I know that's not possible for all animes so please feel free to still send ones with English sub but I'd like it if they can be voiced in Eng.

Level 1 anime enjoyers got absolutely gut punched watching first romance anime,"I was doing just fine. Completely fine. Watching Dragonball z growing up, followed by Naruto (never touching Boruto btw) and more recently One Punch Man, Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen. And apart from the main characters, I will not be able to tell you the names of anyone else and… I only watch dub versions.

Then one day my girlfriend, who watches even less anime than me and more so doesn’t like action/fighting series in general requested we try a romance anime, as she likes romance shows.

After a little search we found HORIMIYA. Cute plot summary, very cute art style, let’s go. We ended up binging the entire show + season 2 and felt like we were robbed when it ended so quickly. So much so that we had to read the manga just to fill in more of the hole Horimiya left in our hearts.

It was amazing. It felt realistic. They are 17-18 year old high schoolers, they study and worry about tests, they hang with friends, they get sick, there’s rumors and love triangles, they get embarrassed by dumb stuff, the first kiss feels special and they fall in love naturally and quickly like teenagers do, they even have implied sex (I don’t care for sex scenes but both my gf and I were gasping when they hooked up and glad they didn’t feel the need to show more or shove it into our face - my girlfriend hoped for more sex is that normal?)

We like the ending, it was just over too quickly and WTF are the writers doing not giving THE BEST GIRL YUKI a happy ending with THE BEST FRIEND ANYONE COULD ASK FOR TORU. Hello??? Limbo state??? No. Make them an official couple immediately.

We rewatched it in Japanese just to have an excuse to watch it again and it was even better.

Anyway, long story short, it moved us. I even made a Reddit JUST let it out cause never felt like I was robbed of happiness before. And now we just need more shows like it. We are already on a YouTube binge of top romance anime’s to watch.

As well as I watch it dub and the voice acting for this anime is amazing It is so good

How I got my brothers into anime,"I wanted to share a funny story about how I convinced my three brothers to watch anime. They used to mock me for watching ""cartoons"" and say that anime is for kids, but now they are hooked and watch more than me!

It all started when I was watching Naruto and they walked in. They saw the fight scenes and the cool characters and they got curious. They asked me what I was watching and I told them it was Naruto, one of the most popular anime of all time. They were skeptical at first, but I convinced them to give it a try. I told them that anime is not just for kids, but for anyone who enjoys good stories, action, comedy, drama, and more.

They agreed to watch the first episode with me and they were hooked. They wanted to watch more and more, and soon they were binge-watching Naruto every day. They even started talking about their favorite characters, jutsus, and arcs. They became huge Naruto fans and they didn't thanked me for introducing them to anime. 😞

But that's not all. One of my brothers, who finished Naruto, wanted to watch more anime. He asked me for recommendations and I gave him a list of some of the best anime I have seen. He started watching them and he loved them. He watched Death Note, Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, One Punch Man, and more.

My other two brothers are still watching Naruto, but they are also interested in other anime. They sometimes watch other shows with me and they enjoy them. They watch My Hero Academia, Demon Slayer, Haikyu, and more. They also started collecting anime merchandise and posters.

It's been over a year and I still haven't gotten over Renai Flops,"I have no idea why this was so underwatched and so hated when it aired meanwhile other harem ecchi shows were praised to the ground. If you haven't seen it already, Renai Flops is a ""typical harem romance with ecchi"" with a billion cliches and stereotypes, however halfway has a gigantic switch which I won't spoil here.

The shift halfway was amazing, done so well, and I often rewatch past episodes to see if I missed any hints. The actual switch left me chills and I was so uncomfortable during *that* scene. Seriously one of the best episodes to air in 2022 and nobody recognized it.

Not counting the half mark, the first few episodes were fucking amazing. People kept trashtalking it and calling it degenerate and trash but it was one of the funniest things I've ever watched. If you like absurdist humour like Nichijou you would love the first few episodes. The humour was executed so well and dirty jokes weren't cringe. Each episode brought development to our cast and provided heavy foreshadowing for later.

After the insane plot twist and cliffhanger, we have a genre switch into a [Renai Flops]>!Sci-Fi!< type shit and also becomes a massive tearjerker while explaining every single shit that happened in the first few episodes. It was perfect and amazingly executed.

The last few episodes broke me. Look, I rarely cry in anime. Anohana, KimiUso, Angel Beats, they barely teared me up (though I do admit crying to K-On, Kakushigoto, Takagi-san), but Renai Flops made me cry in a way I've never done so before in fiction. I was fully invested in every second.

If you don't like ecchi stuff then sure pass this show on but it really is a gem. I admit some parts aren't executed the best, but it is incredibly satisfying and emotional. I was a changed person after watching it.

Renai Flops is NOT:

-a stereotypical harem

-just a dumpster fire ecchi

-a show with no development

-trash



However, Renai Flops IS:

-an emotional and well writen drama

-a hilarious comedy with appropriate amount of ecchi

-a show with lots of developments, advancements, high stakes, plot twists, and heart

-amazing



Do not be fooled by the cover. I never expected this show to hit so hard. If this post convinced anyone to watch the show, do it. It was worth it.",False,anime,1708232108.0,1atlzol,Discussion
Yumemiru - Why are we so used to watching rom-coms that only get real in the last three episodes?,"I´ve just finished watching Yumemiru Danshi wa Genjitsushugisha, also called The Dreaming Boy is a Realist. This is one of the animes you give the three episodes rule but even though you don´t like it quite enough, you just get curious and keep watching it. Although it is not even close to being a conclusive story, somehow it manages to bring a handful of likable characters, but there lies the problem: this anime is a perfect example of a painful standard that happens to many animes, especially rom-coms.

Since I first started using Reddit for anime watching, I just love to see episode discussions after watching each one of them, and it´s funny how common it is to find side characters being way more liked than the FMC, at least till episode 10. In Yumemiru, there is a clear reason for that.

Instead of developing the romance with the main girl Natsukawa, this anime focuses on continuously introducing new girls, that eventually start liking the MC. It´s not that bad and kind of what people expect watching school based animes, since harem is literally everywhere. But the standard of filling the 12-episode length with almost five other girls only to finish with a predictable main girl return is kinda disappointing. Don´t get me wrong, the main girl is perfectly fine, but why invest so much time with side characters if it just doesn´t add up in the end?

That´s why 1to1 animes, like Boku no Kokoro (The Dangers in My Heart) are so good to me, because there is always some progression along the episodes, and even though the end is predictable (we all know eventually they´re gonna end up together), it is worth watching and a great experience overall.

Besides that, authors never surprise us with a side girl route! No matter how good a side girl is, in the end, out of nowhere, the main girl will take her place! What do you guys think?

Are there are anime series that go from racy to mature in storytelling?,"So basically I had an idea for an anime series that stars a protagonist who just wants to hit on women, but then slowly matures into a proper hero as suddenly the story takes a mature turn into something very interesting.




Like basically the concept is that the protagonist is very sleazy and the story is a racy tale that over the course  of the series learns to evolve into something richer where the racy humor is still there, but it gradually shrinks as the series goes on, so if this kind of show has a specific genre that it falls under, please let me know as don’t get me wrong in that I do enjoy anime series with fan servicey elements, but it’s just that lately I’ve been interested in seeing a series that goes from saucy to mature in storytelling is basically what I wanted to seek.",False,anime,1708227773.0,1atkpxw,What to Watch?

trying to find a mid 70s anime movie,"Hi, I already posted this in another group but thought I should try to expand outside the box. To start off my mom’s trying to find the name for this one anime movie she saw when she was 10 years old. p.s. I made some changes after asking her again for clearer details. 
She doesn’t remember much other than the few details she has given me are:
- it was a movie, not a show 
- the main character was a girl or atleast someone on a quest. She mentioned there may have been a prince as well. 
- A blue and white flower (she also mentioned that this flower was to save someone’s life, like Tangled) 
- High up in the mountains.
- She has said it definitely came from Japan or atleast overseas, that the art style was very Japanese, and that it was dubbed in English. 
- She definitely remembers a line, “a flower of life, a flower of life, bring the life of ‘(someone’s name)’ back”  and has mentioned the name could’ve been ‘shin-shin’ she couldn’t spell it but said it sounded like that. (plus the dead character was a male and definitely Japanese, black/brown hair)
- She mentioned that the title could’ve been “(characters name) and the flower” or something similar but definitely was clear on the relation to the story. (I tried suggesting Mary and the witch’s flower but she said that wasn’t it) 
- that the art style was between realism and the well known 60s anime style. 
I was showing her some pictures of 1970s anime and she has said it was like the roses of Versailles kinda style (she said she has never seen any anime in 80s other than voltron but any suggestions from the 80s could be helpful)
-  likely mid 70s

thought I would add those in as well: she watched speed racer, kimba the white lion, and tobor.  
I never seen any of those except speed racer so maybe there’s an episode in one of those that could be a distant memory? 
She also has seen most of the studio ghibi movies so maybe there’s a movie with a similar story that she could’ve mixed up with. 

so far she has said it wasn’t Lun Lun the flower angel, Heidi alps, or the 5000 leagues in search of mother.

Love & Left-overs: Why you should watch NieA_7,"[MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/800/NieA_Under_7) | [AL](https://anilist.co/anime/800/NieA-Under-7/) | [WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NieA_7) | [A YOUTUBER'S OPINIONS](https://youtu.be/yNidRSwwKSg?si=kc6l0Qfis1A_uk6x&t=2607) | [PICTURE OF A CAT](https://imgur.com/dqIAJBl.jpg) | [NO RELATION](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Yoko_Taro_cropped.jpg)
 

### The shortest pitch I can give (tl;dr) 

NieA_7 is a 13-episode comedy/slice of life from the year 2000, following the impoverished student Mayuko and her habitually useless alien roommate NieA through their daily lives. Some of the humour still lands and some not so much, but this show has a heartfelt side that's only gotten better over the years. If you'd like a mixed-tone work somewhere between *Aria* and *Ika Musume* and can accept a somewhat-scuffed production, absolutely give this a try.

### The longer and shorter of it

Alright, I lied. The actual shortest pitch I can give, at least to some, would be ""this anime is *in some sense* like a sister-show of *Haibane Renmei*, which remains well-liked"" - but this just begs you to ask ""in what sense?"". In one sense...: that Haibane is the dark-haired serious sister always trying her best, and NieA_7 is the anime-blonde gremlin creature causing problems on purpose. Which is apt, as NieA_7 (or ""NieA Under Seven"") is a story about [Mayuko](https://i.imgur.com/IDVDhDG.jpg), a serious dark-haired student working part-time jobs to make ends not quite meet, and [NieA](https://imgur.com/7CrJ6zE.jpg), her freeloading trash alien roommate, a general [rascal and nuisance](https://imgur.com/PAit9uW.jpg), two levels worse than the worst kind of alien, etc. So right away you've got the basis of a rough *boke* and *tsukkomi* pair, and the oddball hijinks that ensue as they try to keep their home (a room above an old-fashioned bathhouse) afloat in a struggling economy. 

By itself those are common enough, but NieA also brings a deeper well of emotional warmth that's as hard to describe as it is rare to find. You can really feel the struggle with poverty, Mayuko working multiple jobs while also trying to keep up with her studies, and the difficulty in not lashing out at those around you even when you know they're the ones most pinned under the same boots. This show was made following Japan's ""[Lost Decade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Decades),"" and it has only gained relevance as economic recession and hopelessness have lingered and grown wider spread. But this kind of dark foresight perhaps shouldn't surprise us, given the people behind the show.

### From the Stars

... And in another sense: we start during the production of the iconic *Serial Experiments Lain*, a dark psychological anime with an enduring reputation. Aiming for something a little less heavy to work on next, producer Yasuyuki Ueda picks out a cute alien from character designer Yoshitoshi ABe's notebook. ""Make this a manga,"" [the story goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbadywNSKTs), ""and we'll make an anime out of it."" I have to wonder what working with the guy was like; it sounds a bit intense! Well, NieA goes from notebook sketch to doujinshi to serialised manga, and Triangle Staff picks it up to adapt. Many of the staff from that project also work on this one; in addition to those noted above, I'd call attention to Youta Tsuruoka the sound director, who brings a similar focus on ambient sound and limited but lovely usage of background music when needed. Lain's, ah, *eccentric* writer Chiaki Konaka is notably absent here, though [a certain alien-loving technology-enthusiast Chiaki](https://imgur.com/Ka8Fswm.jpg) appears in the story in what I'd consider a loving cameo. 

There's also a fair few staff overlapping with the creators of *Haibane Renmei*, the next work by Yoshitoshi ABe and Yasuyuki Ueda. The shift to Studio Radix means there are more changes, but they retain talent like director/storyboard artist Tomokazu Tokoro, and the effect on the result is evident in the two having a similar ""half-iyashikei"" mood - where here, the ""healing type"" refers less to the fluffier, cute girls doing nothing genre (though it has a measure of that), but rather to a kind of gentle and wistful reflection on [loss and time](https://imgur.com/p4YZ6sG.jpg).

I also want to mention the opening theme, [*Koko made oide*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6zM_jcnkWA) by SION (Hideki Fujino). The absurdly croaked vocals are at first a little funny, but I grew to really like them - it has a kind of warmth and humanity about it, and the way that stands out against the electric instruments and the synth sounds at the start, it just really fits the spirit of the show.

Right, so, in conclusion... Am I forgetting something? Oh, right, yeah, in this story aliens arrived on Earth a while back, it was a thing-

### Addressing the [Allegations](https://imgur.com/MU7ACUI.jpg): Aliens, Stereotypes, Politics

okay, so. If you already know you don't care about this kinda bit, just skip it. But yeah, we oughta talk about there being aliens, and sometimes ""aliens"" means visitors from outer space, but sometimes it means people from one country who live in another. In NieA_7, they're the former type. You can see their giant, [classic-UFO mothership sitting in the skybox](https://imgur.com/4grQmDf.jpg) all jaunty-angled. So aliens from space are here to stay, after a lot of social discomfort and paperwork and being assigned a kind of rating system of personal merit by the governmen- *god damn it*. okay. They're both kinds of aliens, in a kind of extended but not omnipresent metaphor.

But, alright. The allegations. Yeah. There's some not so great stereotypes of actual ethnic minorities (in Japan), or, more specifically there's [Chada the Indian Alien](https://imgur.com/XMvxxNu.jpg), speaking the language badly, eating perilously Ethnic Food, being overly familiar with the women... basically a South Park character. Now, there are three points one can make. Firstly, he is an alien-Japanese person, not an Indian-Japanese person; is this talking about Indian people, or about *perceptions of them* by a kind of Universal Cultural Outsider? And then secondly, there's the episodic post-credits live action bit - an idea that would sadly never catch on - with [Dalgit the ""Alien Chada Image Consultant.""](https://imgur.com/bY78Hxx.jpg) I genuinely do not know if this is, like, extremely tasteless humour at the guy's expense, or if they actually ran the script past him to make sure it wasn't crossing the line. 

Thirdly, though, and most importantly -  as discussed above, NieA Under Seven has, at its best points, a sense of compassion about it that goes beyond didactic lesson-of-the-day stories. I like that there are immigrant stories that see them as, essentially, model citizens that just happen to look different, and I'm glad to see more like those. But I also like to think there's space for saying - well, so what if someone's literally the stereotype? [They're lovable anyway](https://imgur.com/BiHOHMP.jpg). 


### Identity

So, what *is* NieA_7? Is it a comedy with some iffy jokes? Is it a lesser-known *iyashikei* from the tail end of the genre's first peak? Is it politically-thematic sci-fi with denpa elements? I don't know. I think of it like an omelette made with whatever you have in the fridge. The flavours can seem a bit strange together; the bottom's a bit burned because there wasn't enough butter. The imperfection of it tells a story about when and how it was made that a more refined, restaurant-quality dish never could. I hope you'll give a thought to trying this show or something like it in the future.

Ping Pong The Animation 10th Anniversary Rewatch - Interest Thread,"
[_Enter the hero! Enter the hero! Enter the hero! Chant these words and I'll come to you..._](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v6iOVhw6mQ)

### Intro

Hi everyone! Seeing as the 10 year anniversary of Ping Pong The Animation is coming up I wanted to organize a rewatch. I have been a long time participant of /r/anime rewatches and have wanted to host one myself for a while. Given that this is a show I really adore, the timing of the anniversary, and that the [last rewatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/rewatches/rewatch_archive/2020#wiki_ping_pong_the_animation) was in 2020 I thought this would be the perfect time to host one.

### Background

You may be wondering ""What is Ping Pong The Animation?""

Originally adapted from the seinen manga by Taiyou Matsumoto, Ping Pong The Animation follows the lives of a number of  high school table tennis prodigies and the people around them as they learn to navigate the harsh climate of competitive sport leading up to the inter-high tournament.

The anime adaptation is directed by [Masaaki Yuasa](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=6940) of [Devilman: Crybaby](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35120/Devilman__Crybaby) and [The Tatami Galaxy](https://myanimelist.net/anime/7785/Yojouhan_Shinwa_Taikei) fame. He has an extremely distinctive style and consistently collaborates with a core group of producers, musicians, animators, and artists to craft an anime watching experience totally unique to the medium. In particular I'd like to shout out the now beloved composer [Kensuke Ushio](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=125625) who's first solo anime soundtrack credit was for Ping Pong and would go on to compose music for [A Silent Voice](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28851/Koe_no_Katachi), [Chainsaw Man](https://myanimelist.net/anime/44511/Chainsaw_Man), and the previously mentioned Devilman: Crybaby.

But apart from my words of praise, check out what other users of the subreddit have said of the show! From [2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2w34qj/wt_ping_pong_the_animation/) to  [2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/xejet4/wt_why_you_should_watch_ping_pong_the_animation/) Ping Pong the Animation has remained [extremely well regarded](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/lc26je/ping_pong_the_animation_thursday_anime_discussion/). It is ranked within the top 100 anime on MyAnimeList with over 200,000 users who have completed the show.

**How to Watch**

Ping Pong The Animation is available for streaming or digital purchase depending on your location

[Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRJQV0N3Y/ping-pong-the-animation)

[Funimation](https://www.funimation.com/shows/ping-pong-the-animation/) (RIP)

[Apple TV](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/ping-pong-the-animation/umc.cmc.1o28gpevuussaj895si3ms7fj)

The Blu-rays are tragically out of print as far as I can tell, but may be available on resale sites.

### Rewatch Details

I'm hoping to run the rewatch with 1 episode a day starting on the anniversary on April 11th (A little over 50 days from now). Threads would go up at 1pm PST (4pm EST, 7pm UTC) but I'm open to adjusting the times if you have suggestions.

Also, I thought it would be cool to include the [Tekkon Kinkreet film](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2154/) as part of the rewatch. It's another anime adapted from a manga by the same author of Ping Pong, Taiyou Matsumoto. /r/anime hasn't held a rewatch for the film yet so it could be a good opportunity for us to discuss it for a first time. What do you all think? If we include it we could discuss it on April 24th.

Preliminary timetable:

| Date     | Episode           |
|----------|-------------------|
| April 11 | Episode 1         |
| April 12 | Episode 2         |

| April 19 | Episode 9         |
| April 20 | Episode 10        |
| April 21 | Episode 11        |

In 2021,while i was watching an anime in a popular site,i came across an ova with little views that caught my attention. I decided to give it a go and it was actually pretty decent. It was less than an hour and was made in the 2000's.
I searched up it's title and it resulted me finding out it had a blu ray release. I forgot about it until 1 year ago and now i can't seem to find it.
More details on the story would be that there was a war going on(for reasons i can't recall) and the first 20 minutes of the anime were filled with pretty much action between the two sides. I remember that there were fighting at night,on land and that there were a castle on the first side. The next detail i can recall is that one side had a secret ""weapon"",a woman of colour dressed very lightly who came into the battlefield dancing very eerily that either distracted them or killed them(i can't remember which). 
Something to note is that the cover of the ova was black and white with 2 women on each side. Does it ring a bell to anyone?

So what happened after JJK S2 Mappa Controversy?,"Did MAPPA promise to fix the problems and improve their working conditions, and maybe pay more than a Mcdonalds salary to the overworking animators? I did some digging but all I can find are the old news of the animators breaking down during the production of Shibuya Incident Arc. Isn't the government of Japan or some anime-manga artists guild or some big shot mangaka are supporting the artists or speaking against MAPPA? 

I've just finished s2 episode 17 and while my mouth was agape during the entire episode -because holy hell that was probably one of the most brutal episode I ever watched on TV- I couldn't even criticize the obvious drop in the animation quality because of the poor animators suffering in a metaphorical hell in Mappa's Domain Expansion: Malevolent Workplace. I hope they unionize and sue the shit outta Mappa or something. I know that Mappa is probably just a part of the problem and the main issue is the entire animation industry but it could set a good precedent for others to follow.

What long awaited anime adaption disappointed you?,"We've all had one manga/LN that we waited years (if not decades for) to be adapted into an anime, and unfortunately it may not have come out the best. For me, it was Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer.  


For a lot of people, this was *the* Mizukami series we wanted to see adapted, and when the series finally got announced it, it felt like a celebration all around. That was until it actually aired.  


https://reddit.com/link/1at9e7v/video/dswyvezrz6jc1/player

The series was unfortunately rushed, and the clip above is just one of the many moments of QUALITY animation the series had. The VAs did a great job with the characters, but overall the adaption left a lot to be desired. After the first few episodes aired, the initial immense hype the series had was gone, felt very strange to see after years of people hoping an anime would be announced.

Need some anime recommendation ?," 

Hi guys, Hope you are all fine.

Just wanted some suggestion for anime. I want to start a new anime which has some decent sad story, nice devopment and good graphics. Just to mention I watched violet evergarden a month ago and it kinda felt like i should change myself.  
Want to get a similar type of anime maybe not the same category but sad story, character development is all i need for now.

A little emotional kind of story.

Movies can also be suggested if you feel one that is good enough.",False,anime,1708193168.0,1at843y,What to Watch?

Couldn't find it on Google and Youtube.

"Want to like anime, need some recs","Howdy! I want to get into amine, but whenever I've tried in the past I've only enjoyed niche shows or if I was watching with friends because of the social aspect; I watched Trinity Seven with an old roommate which was hilarious, and the first arc of Demon Slayer so I could see Mugen Train with friends in theater - though I haven't revisited the series since then. I liked Bleach as a kid, but tried rewatching as an adult and couldn't get into it. I like Fate/Stay Zero, but couldn't get into the other entries, and I enjoyed Hetalia Axis Powers, but that's not really a show of substance. 

I couldn't get into Naruto or DragonBall, but I liked yugioh and pokemon as a kid. Some cartoons I have enjoyed (as both a kid and an adult) are Teen Titans, Batman Beyond, Avatar the Last Airbender, Legend of Korra, and Invincible. 

One of my favorite shows of all time is Firefly but I couldn't get into Cowboy Bebop, though I'm open to retrying it, and a friend of mine recommend Castlevania (didn't hook me) and Blue Samurai (haven't watched) on Netflix. I will say, when Star Wars released the non-canon one-offs I enjoyed the episode about The Ronin, and I enjoyed the vintage Clone Wars, but I couldn't get into Samurai Jack.

I've accepted I probably just don't like anime, because where it seems like I'm picky my tastes still don't line up... But if you have any recommendations at all please let me know!!",False,anime,1708188827.0,1at6ell,What to Watch?

The /r/anime Trivia Contest Starts at 1800UTC/1200CST Today!,"##We're having a trivia contest! Details can be found in [the thread that was posted a week ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1aoo0w1)! We'll repeat some of the information here for ease of access. It starts at 1800UTC (2 hours from now)/1200CST. 

#Thanks everyone for joining! You can watch the [VOD here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2065576084) if you missed it! Join us next time!



***

#To join:

Go to https://play.blooket.com and enter the code that appears at https://twitch.tv/Dr_JWilson (we'll update this post with the code when we're live). Wait patiently for the game to start, and answer the questions to the best of your ability! Win those prizes! Which include...

A **$100 [Sentai Filmworks](https://www.sentaifilmworks.com/) Gift Card for the winner**, and a **year subscription to Crunchyroll Premium** for the runner-up!

***

#Participation Details

The trivia contest will be hosted today, February 17th, 2024 at 1800/UTC1200CST. This will be a **live** event! We will be using [Blooket](https://www.blooket.com/) in order to deliver questions and process answers, and the entire thing will be streamed [on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/Dr_JWilson). You don't necessarily have to tune into the Twitch stream, but you'll be able to see how you're doing on each question compared to your fellow trivia players, and most importantly... be able to  [**trash talk in chat.**](#trololol).  

&nbsp;

Also, if you couldn't make it into the lobby, we still encourage you to play along—that also goes for people who missed the event entirely and watch the VOD!

Blooket handles up to 300 players, which hopefully is more than enough. It'll be a first-come, first-served basis, and we'll start promptly on time with however many players were able to join. **You must use your Reddit username as your nickname**. This will be used to validate account requirements as well as be the final delivery means for prizes. And of course, **you may not cheat**, either by looking up the answers, discussing the questions with others, or impersonating someone else. Any evidence of this is grounds for immediate disqualification and potentially a ban from the subreddit. Let's keep this clean and fun!

Once again, the trivia contest will be hosted on February 17th, 2024 at 1800UTC/1200CST. Another post will go up the day of to remind people to join for a chance to win some great prizes!

#Prizes

How can we afford prizes you ask?

##[We've got Reddit money](https://files.catbox.moe/1vwh05.png). 
[](#shutupandtakemymoney)

The Reddit Community Funds program has afforded us the opportunity to experiment and try new ways to keep the subreddit fun and give back to the community. If this goes well and people have a good time, we hope to do this again!

First place winner, the one who successfully conquers the gauntlet of arcane and mostly useless (sorry) trivia knowledge, will receive a **[$100 Sentai Filmworks](https://www.sentaifilmworks.com/) Gift Card.** You could spend it immediately, but Sentai often has absurd sales, so you could get quite a lot of bang for your buck!

[](#seasonalhype)

Second place runner-up will receive a **year subscription of Crunchyroll Premium**! Crunchyroll has a great catalogue of shows and a number of good pick-ups from season to season. A year subscription is an $80 value that could free that money up for other anime endeavors!

#Eligibility

Now for a bit of disappointing news. Since these prizes are funded through Reddit, there are certain regional restrictions. Namely, in order to be eligible for prizes, you must be a legal resident of **the United States of America, the United Kingdom Australia, or Canada (excluding Quebec)**. You must also meet /r/anime's new account restrictions, namely **be an account older than 8 days and have more than 10 karma**. You must not be banned from /r/anime (duh!) and must be in good standing with the community.",False,anime,1708185653.0,1at578k,Concluded

I can only remember this anime from this one clip I saw ages ago. Care to help me out?," 

It was in a snowy area under a blizzard. There were 2 characters in this scene, one was male and the other might have been a female (they were wearing trapper winter hats so it was hard to tell). One of them was experiencing frostbite, so the joke was the other one would be peeing on it. They show the golden stream of pee spray, might not have been but possibly, on the face of the frostbitten person. From what I have remembered, this show was supposed to be a comedy series but with a very serious undertone at times.

Anime characters with masks have always intrigued fans with their mysterious and enigmatic presence. But what is the purpose behind these masks? Is it purely for the plot or does it serve a deeper meaning? Furthermore, who do you think is the best-masked anime character? 

It's quite hard but it is definitely Zero for me.

Zero from **Code Geass** is one of the [most iconic anime characters with a mask](https://www.yualexius.com/2023/10/anime-characters-with-masks.html). Also known as Lelouch Lamperouge, Zero is a master strategist who leads a rebellion against a tyrannical empire. His sleek black mask not only adds to his mysterious aura but also conceals his true identity, allowing him to operate in secrecy and manipulate events to his advantage.

Our Dating story: The experienced you and inexperienced me..,"Was unexpected in the best way!

An unexpected hero in Violet Evergarden,"I especially like animes with deep themes that I can think about during and after watching. The more I notice the good planning and thoughts behind it, the more I like and appreciate it. \_I realised something about a character after the final movie (and this is just my perception):\_     

&#x200B;

 < Dietfried, Gilbert's brother, is seen as a villain at first. However, in the later parts a few more things are revealed. He refused to take on the role of a major, soldier, or just anyone in the army that his father had expected of him. In order to protect Dietfried, Gilbert took his place in doing what his father required. So, in the end Gilbert distanced himself from Violet because he took on full guilt of the harm that he caused in war, especially towards Violet, saying that someone like him did not deserve her. When Violet writes her last letter to him, in simple circumstances I think he might have just cried and let her go away.  

&#x200B;

Dietfried, who has started to have a changed heart when experiencing Violet's love towards his brother, voiced to Gilbert that he himself would carry the family name so that Gilbert would be free of his feeling of guilt, just as he had told Violet to be free. After this, he tells his brother to ""go"", almost like dismissing him from his previous role and encouraging him to leave his cage of guilt for love.  

&#x200B;

What exactly went on in the men's minds in this is a bit difficult for me to understand, or why the Dietfried's short statements were powerful enough for Gilbert to see them as authoritative. Maybe this is because Dietfried claimed his role as leader in the army as it actually should have belonged to him in the first place. Then, Gilbert would have acknowledged his brother's right to take his rightful role back. This would mean that he would respect an order from his brother, even if this order was to be dismissed of his position.  

&#x200B;

What I do believe is that if Dietfried had not said that he would account for the family's actions as this was his initial job, Gilbert would have lost the person whom he loves more than any other. The simple statement enabled Gilbert to start believing that he was allowed to be happy. From being complacent and planning on rotting alone in sorrow, he sprints after Violet with pure resolve and desire to be with her. Violet and Gilbert reunite and stay together for life, as it is implied in the after-credit scene, and as it says in the last LN that they get married.  

&#x200B;

A CHALLENGE FOR PROS! Looking for the name of an old anime,"Hi, guys!

This will be a very strange request, but I'm looking for the name of an old anime. I watched it on TV with my dad when I was very very young (around 4/5, so it must have been early 2000/2001) but it has kind of stuck with me as a fond memory of a time we spent together and I would really like to find it and rewatch it. I don't remember many details but there was this petite girl with dark hair and everything was happening in the forest/mountains. I wouldn't be surprised if it's  a studio Ghibli anime, cause it had some very aesthetically pleasing nature scenes. I remember that there was a boy as well, but he was sick or injured and she had to take care of him. One particular thing I remember is that she had to feed him, but he couldn't eat on his own, so she had to chew the food for him and spit it in his mouth - I guess it grossed me out a bit as a child, so that's a prety vivid memory. 😅 I guess they were running away from something/ someone evil or there was some kind of danger and she had to save him.

Anyways, I hope that would suffice and your superpowers and deep knowledge of animes would help a poor girl in need. 😁 Thanks in advance!",False,anime,1708165246.0,1asyu7i,Help

Am I a fool for expecting there to be a reason for a character to be reincarnated into other world?,"There are quite a few isekai where the character is reincarnated into another world (as opposed to being directly summoned) but sometimes I feel Iike they just never explain why. 

When the explanation for reincarnation is never given, I usually give the show the benefit of the doubt and assume the reason will be given in a part of the story that the anime hadsn’t adapted yet, or maybe hasn’t even been explained con the source material yet either.

The thing is though, it feels like some of these shows aren’t interested in ever giving a reason. There’s no hint at an answer ever being revealed and nothing to give me the idea that the reincarnation into that specific world is anything other than a huge coincidence.

 I read the synopsis earlier for an upcoming anime where a girl gets reincarnated as the relative of a character in a story she was writing before she died. It’s too crazy of an occurence not to feel like it should have some meaning but  I wonder if it will. 

Am I just missing some Japanese cultural context of the widely known (over there) belief in reincarnation and when there’s no reason given in an isekai story for it I’m just supposed to be satisfied with  inferring myself that “it was totally normal reincarnation that just happened to put the character in that particular world”?

Shows like 7th Time Loop Villainess (granted, it’s not over yet) or ones where the character goes into the world of a game or book they have a special relationship with put the character in a world with highly specific circumstances relating to the protagonist which seem like they NEED to give a reason for why they were brought into that specific world but some just don’t seem all that bothered with that part of their story and you’re just supposed to accept it and move on.

What non-perverted trope do you despise?,"We all know we hate perverted tropes... mostly. So, what else do you hate even more than that?

Mine?

It's when a character (usually, the protag) has a dead abusive parent/parental figure. But then, to progress their character arc, they later learned that their abuse is just them giving ""tough love"" to the kid, followed by a flashback replay where the kid lashes out on the ""parent"" and we see this ""parent"" smile a bit at the kid's rebellion. 

And then, the kid would be having an internal monologue like, ""Alright, my mom was a bitch, but at least now I know she really loves me after all. I (sorta) forgive her for all the emotional and psychological shit they put me through for most of my developmental years. At least I understand now that she did it to give me a better character development.""

Please help me find an anime that made my mom really mad back in 2004 but was probably made on or before 2004.,"I have no idea what anime this is and I can only recall a specific scene from it.

What I know:

* Aired on TV in the US, most likely had an English dub
* I don't remember seeing it anywhere else or ever again
* The scene I remember consisted of a woman standing outside of someone's apartment (or house or trailer), and the door was probably shut in her face (not angrily), and it seemed to be night outside, and possible raining
* The woman in the anime had longer hair, probably brown, or black, or blue, or green (some darker hair)
* The door was not slammed or violently closed, but rather, closed normally or gently
* The woman did NOT have blonde, white, silver or light hair
* She seemed relatively confused and/or hurt
* After the door was shut in her face and/or just shut by the person inside, the camera/frame focused on her, and she sighed
* The person shutting the door to them was male, most likely
* I don't remember any fantastic elements or sci-fi elements in this scene - seemed contemporary, but does not rule out those elements
* It seemed pretty serious, or at least not silly
* This had to be made some time before 2005, because the place I saw it I moved out of in late 2004/early 2005.
* We had satellite (DirectTV) at the time, and I remember seeing anime on several different channels, including a channel or two dedicated to anime, a channel related to TNT, and some others
* This aired during the day, and while possibly it was in the Toonami block, I don't see anything in Toonami that resembles it
* The show did not seem to be for kids, and maybe YA at the most
* My mom was REALLY ANGRY at this scene - she told me ""no, you're not watching that, it's so stupid, no, you can't see this, you're not allowed to watch this"", etc

That's all I know. If I recall other details, I will post them.

**Edit:** Some of the suggestions are good so far. Thanks for everyone who is helping me. I know this post looks kind of suspicious, but any help is appreciated. Narrowing it down, slowly but surely.

**Edit 2:** I found a website that lists all dubbed anime by decade. I don't know how accurate it is, but I'm going to start with the 1990s and 2000s. Site:  [A list of all Dubbed Anime ever Released in the United States | EDAL (english-dubbed.com)](https://english-dubbed.com/worth-reading/a-list-of-all-dubbed-anime-in-the-united-states/)

**Edit 3:** There were only several channels on satellite at that time that would have been airing anime: G4tv, Cartoon Network, and Sci-Fi (SyFy now I think). If anyone can think of any other channels that would have aired anime back at that time, it would be helpful.

**Edit 4:** This list includes candidates that Redditors have suggested. It is divided into two parts: Correct Memory and Incorrect Memory. Correct Memory assumes that I am remembering everything exactly. Incorrect Memory assumes I might have mixed something up or a made a mistake.

**Edit 5:** I added Rurouni Kenshin to the list because one of the characters looks similar to the scene I mentioned. Also, there is a chance it took place in older times. I distinctly remember there being no sci-fi or outright fantastical stuff.

*Correct Memory:*

* Love Hina
* Fruit's Basket
* Please Twins
* Macross
* Ayashi no Ceres
* His and Her Circumstances
* Burst Angel
* GTO
* Tenchi Muyo
* Ranma 1/2
* Maison Ikkoku
* Ai Yori Aoshi
* Elfen Lied
* Devil Lady
* Full Metal Panic
* Tenchi Muyou
* Excel Saga
* Rurouni Kenshin

*Incorrect Memory:*

* Rumbling Hearts

Oreyaba (Dangers) OP2 is really amazing the more you watch it,"I feel like out of all the pretty darn good OPs we've gotten in Winter'24, Bokuyaba (Dangers of my Heart) OP2 is just on a different level for me.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0tKGpKOU4Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0tKGpKOU4Y)

The themesong by Atarayo! is obviously a big component of it, and it's rocking.

But Araki Tetsuro directed the animation for OP2, and OH MY GAWD the animation on this OP is truly something else.  Araki is best known as the series director of S2/S3 of Attack on Titan, and it's kind of amazing what he can do with a short 1:30 for a romcom. 

The small details get me.  

From the start of the OP to 0:53, almost every scene's color palette is darkened, both Yamada and Ichikawa in each scene being depicted primarily in shadows, with slightly melancholy expressions even in scenes when they are smiling.

The exceptions are very deliberate, such as several cuts where for example, Ichikawa is clearly Learning about Yamada's life as a model, and she, in Ichikawa's mind, is depicted smiling and in very stylish clothing and poses at 0:32).

The movement and animation are subdued.  Animated movements like Ichikawa pressing his hands against his face in shame (to the lyric about self loathing) are subtle.

Yamada and Ichikawa are depicted primarily alone, or seemingly alone even with other characters in the frame.

As the music enters the key line ""君の全てに救われて"" (my everything was saved by you) and the two singers voices begin singing together marks a huge transition.  The transition from 0:53 when Ichikawa says something to Yamada (sure seems like a confession), and the shadows and dark matted colors shift as the sunlight changes the color palette, multicolored flower pedals fly, and the wind blow back Yamada's delighted and surprised face.

Everything gets kicked off with Yamada taking a huge leap down a slight of stairs, seemingly floating in the air as the music takes a quick pause for a breath and your anticipation builds.

Then everything is well lit, covered in sunshine.  Ichikawa and Yamada are running through a seemingly multicolored spray of flower pedals, 

You transition to Yamada and Ichikawa dancing on a platform surrounded by all their friends, except at 1:08 - 1:13 when they wind up to make a heart together with their arms, the background pans around the gym that until a moment ago was filled with the rest of the cast is suddenly surrepiticiously empty, symbolizing a private moment together.

Which sets the stage for the final moment on the bench together, both slightly tense but clearly in love with each other, nervous about something that's about to happen.

I just love everything about this OP, I think OP director Araki hit this one out of the park.",False,anime,1708113547.0,1ashz3g,Discussion

Need help finding a show I watched yars ago.,"Sup, 

Recently I've been trying to find a show I watched a couple years back, but I can't remember it's name.

All I recall is that is that main character was a normal dude who's class was a villager, his childhood friend's class was hero, and his rich classmates' class was demon lord.

From what I recall, the episodes generally went like this:

MC would talk to his classmate, giving her general advice.

Classmates would have some wild interpretation of the advice to enact some long term evil plan.

The plan was seen as helpful by others much to her dismay. For example, I remember she gave everyone free air conditioned bus rides, and bottled milk from a farm she started in school because she wanted to contribute to global warming.

The hero friend would see through the plan and thwart her, only to get in trouble.

Every time I try searching for this show on Google I keep getting results about shows from recent years.

I'm stumped and am now asking for your help.

Oresuki - Finally getting to know the meaning of flowers in the anime,"It´s been 4 years since the release of Oresuki anime, but I´ve just finished watching it.

After going through all the episodes and the OVA, I read a comment on a Reddit discussion section that got me thinking about how I didn´t realize it till the end of the series: 

Oresuki is a complete flower metaphor!

First, all girl's names are based on flowers: Pansy, Cosmos, Himawari, Sasanqua, Asunaru

Then, what I thought was just a way to mention Oga-kun's shining personality, also has a meaning about teaming up with water and helping flowers to grow: Sun-chan!

And last but not least, we have the water supply metaphor: Joro means watering can, as shown in the anime beginning and Hazuki Yasuo - Hose (that was easy) indeed means hose. So, it basically means that although the hose can get a bunch of water to many flowers, it can also hurt them, by doing it on the wrong amount. Joro is different, it may look weaker, and way less efficient, but it just makes it all work by doing it carefully and thoughtfully, as the MC does till the end of the anime.

For me, that realization was pretty cool, and I thought about making this post to show my love for this anime even after all this time. 

That being said, Sasanqua best girl fr!

"Animes like One Piece , Attack on Titan and Fire Force","Spoiler warning for all these animes.

So , Looking for animes like the above where the world has altered history , some authority (world government/Holy Sol Temple ) controlling the world and preventing others from discovering secrets of this world which would impact the whole world and change whole perspective of that world.

I really like how you slowly discovered one and other plot point and you can theorize what could have happened and see the mystery revealed slowly as the plot progresses and compare with new plot reveals.

Another think I like is environmental storytelling too[like some clues about ancient world which aren't outright told but we can see in background like in paintings , carvings etc or some conversations between characters that take a whole new meaning when you come back to that part with more mysteries solved ] 

I want suggestions for animes of that sort.",False,anime,1708093441.0,1as9scj,What to Watch?

LOOKING FOR AN ANIME TITLE PLS HELP,"Hello everyone  
Recently a memory from my past popped into my mind.  
There was this anime (Not sure whetever it was japanese but most likely it was) that was on television during early 2000's ( maybe 2007/8) in an Italian channel (italia1) but they stopped airing the show so  drastically.  
I was absolutely in love with that show but i cant remember the title.  
Both me and my brother have this memory so its not something i imagined.  


Plot:  
The main charachter was a young kid who was living in an advanced hi-tech society.   
He was wearing a cool watch that let him go into a another dimension.  
He was piloting  a huge robot that could talk.  
When the robot was transforming it was  sprinting through some rails like a train. (mario kart rainbow road vibes).  


This kid and his robot started to defend the planet Earth while fighting against some evil bots that had some ANIMAL features. I clearly remeber a robot looking like a Shark.  
Once these enemies were defeated in combact, they get purified and  become allies.  


And this is pretty much all i remember.  
Its not ZOIDS

Can u guys understand what im talking about?

What to watch next with my friend?,"Hey guys so I need some of your help & recommendations.

Over the past few years I've (23M) been watching a few great anime shows with my good friend (23F) and introducing her to some of my favorites in the medium. It's been great for our relationship and it's something I wish to continue. 

So far we've watched:

* Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood
* Death Note 
* Attack on Titan

We're currently on the last leg of Attack on Titan so I am now starting to think about what we could watch next. All of these stories are great, human, and with a deep emotional core that resonated with us and helped her connect to the shows and characters. That is why as I start to look for our next show that is something I am keeping in mind. 

Basically I'm currently thinking of undertaking Hunter x Hunter next as it has a super cool world and strategy element to the combat but primarily because of its beautiful core friendships and relationships between the characters. My question is do you think this is a good next step? HxH is a bit longer than the rest of these shows and isn't really truly complete but it is one of my favorite shows regardless which is why I'm leaning towards it atm. 

If you've got other suggestions I'm completely open to them as I'm here to look for inspiration. However please keep in mind that these should be aimed towards someone who doesn't typically watch anime so if we could keep ""anime-ism's"" to a minimum that would be amazing please. I'm specifically referring to fanservice and random s\*xual scenes popping out of no where bc I can't stand them and neither can she.

What do we call New-Gen anime when they aren't new?,"People call Black Clover, JuJutsu Kaisen, My Hero Academia etc. 'New gen' anime.

The Holy Shounen Trinity was the new-gen about 20 years ago, relative to Zeta Gundam, Dragon Ball, North Star etc. 

Within a decade the new-gen will likely end and be replaced with some other anime. There are always new spirit detective shows like Yu Yu Hakusho, Bleach and Jujutsu Kaisen.

Looking for a mix between Bunny Senpai and Mushoku Tensei(Jobless Reincarnation),"I am far from an anime expert but have seen a decent amount of anime in my life. At least over 70 but mostly really popular anime. Some of my favorites ever are Samurai Champloo, HxH, Rurouni Kenshin(original have yet to see the remake), Cowboy Bepop, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Jobless Reincarnation. Maybe it’s with age or just me getting bored of the same ideas reiterated in a lot of action anime but I have semi turned to the slice of life/romcom anime suggestions.

Anime that have a Western appeal are better in dubbed. ,"
When it comes to anime, anime not just set in japan but also set in every corner of the world including western world or european-esque fantasy setting, when i was watching anime on western european or american setting, i just watching it on english dub than japanese.

but there something that bother me and think of it example when watching something like Princess Principal, Vinland Saga or JoJo , where every character speak japanese even when speak to foreign and they are understand people like Chise or Horikawa or in episode 6 of Vinland Saga when Thorfinn was take care by English women and her granddaughter and when the viking invade the village Thorfinn was trying to warn the people, but they are not understand english (although everyone speaking japanese ) and there something like Appare-ranman where when the two main character in america everyone can speak japanese. Black Lagoon is another high class dub with western influences. Cowboy Bebop and Trigun are both influenced by westerns and sci-fi so the dubs were better. 

i think the english dub of that anime will giving an opportunity like using an right accent for the character in the setting or foreigners have some create unique than what japan just use some sophisticated dialect on noble or rich character and if the anime is set on non england or america they  may not use accent but they could use some phrase of that language example like Maria the virgin witch and Jojo part 5. 

so in my opinion i like watching anime that set in western with english dub for the better unique authenticity",False,anime,1708057479.0,1arzrb6,Discussion
I’m trying to remember the title of this anime that aired on local tv when I was a kid.,"I have been watching a lot of anime ever since i was a kid. Back then, I did not have any resources to watch anime that I like. I only have our tv to watch anime on. So there are things that I watch but don’t remember as vividly because it was such a long time ago. I remember watching a fantasy anime about this guy that has a tattoo (?) and gems (?) on the back of his hand and he summons his sort of like familiar wind spirit through that. This wind spirit has white hair (i think) and wings. The setting was I believe medieval because if I remember correctly, the backdrop of this show has a lot of houses and castles from the olden days (much like the ones on Nanatsu no Taizai or Claymore). Another thing that I remember is this main character guy had acquired a fire spirit of some sort and he had 2 gems on the back of his hand, 1 green for the wind spirit and 1 red for the fire spirit. This anime aired on local channels back where I’m from around early 2000s. 2005-9ish? That’s all I can remember to be honest. I hope someone can help lol I just want to watch it again for nostalgia. Thank you so much.

"What anime+manga used a boxing metaphor to demonstrate the difference in observational ability between a ""casual fan"" and a ""seasoned pro""?","I wanted to remember where the hell I saw this being explained, but I, for the life of me, cannot remember what specific series did this.

The gist is that it's a scene where two people are fighting, and one of the outside observers comments on the two fighters' difference in ability.  Another says that they can't really tell the difference, but the former comments that to the layperson, all people would be seen as ""strong"" after a certain point, but for those who know what's actually going on, they would be able to see the details and difference in abilities (or something like that).

All I remember is that:  I first saw it in a manga and there's one panel where there person who's giving the explanation, and in the background has a person with a sprout on their head looking at a boxer shadowboxing thinking that they're ""strong"".

Help me identify this anime,"Hi! I need some help identifying this anime. I watched a clip of this anime in a gore compilation 10 years ago. The scene was of a samurai riding a kind of hell horse.

It was an old anime (likely of the 90') and it was very gory, so it can be an OVA or a movie.

I can't remember nothing else, the name of any character or anything, sorry. It looked a lot like Ninja Scroll, Blood Reign or Wrath of the Ninja.

LF Anime with a particular bracket system in a tournament,"Hi everyone,  
Today I was discussing with my friends about tournament arcs and I remembered something from my childhood.

It was a strange tournament format where partecipants could vote for one of the other partecipants. Now I think i remember that they had to vote for who they wanted to avoid fighting and the most voted would end up directly in the finals. Maybe the mechanism wasn't exactly this but something quite similar. In fact the brackets ended up being very asimmetrical and some people had to fight all the way to the finals while someone else got direct access to it.

The most feared was a badass, I remember only that.

Oh and the anime is quite old, probably more than 10/15 years old.

If anyone knows the anime's name, please share.

Thanks in advance

  
**EDIT:**

I watched both the 1999 and the newer version of Hunter x Hunter and i don't think that's the one i remember. In particular in Hunter x Hunter the exam final tournament brackets are chosen by the president according to the partecipants' strenght, abilities and attitude. 

If someone can suggest another anime please do and thanks again!",False,anime,1708028568.0,1arp5bx,Help

What is the worst English dub voice you've ever heard in any anime?,"For me it's Stephanie Nadolny's Goku. The main issue is that her cadence as Goku is terrible, and she'll randomly raise and lower the pitch in her voice during sentences to the point that it sounds unnatural and grating. (For an example, go to Stephanie's voice sample here: [https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/voice-compare/Dragon-Ball/Kid-Goku/](https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/voice-compare/Dragon-Ball/Kid-Goku/) and skip to :37. Listen to how she raises her voice when she says ""I've ever seen"".) Her Gohan, while also not good, was at least able to avoid this issue, hence why I consider that her better role. There's other issues too, like her creepy Woody Woodpecker/Krusty the Clown laugh and how she just can't act very well at all. Her reaction to Krillin's death in DB is infamously terrible.

Vinland Saga Season 2 Thoughts (completed),"In my opinion, season 2 was a vast improvement over season 1. Not to say that season 1 wasn't necessary to build the foundation for season 2, but the execution of season 2 landed much better for me.

The most common criticism of season 2 is that it's boring, but I personally appreciate the slower and more introspective approach that season 2 takes, giving the characters space to reflect and develop. Thorfinn in particular. His multi-episode transformation from an empty, passively suicidal husk, into someone who has found a new purpose in life, was handled quite well. 

It was a very smart decision to move him from living amongst the violent oppressors to experiencing the other side of the conflicts that he participated in, but in a way that removes him from the trauma enough for him to make a genuine friend, touch grass, and reflect on his life. It gives him the chance to experience kindness from his enemies and see them as humans, but doesn't fail to later remind the audience that what his enemies are doing is fundamentally fucked (looking at you, Ketil). 

Only after Thorfinn has had time to grow does the series thrust him back into the more violent side of his reality, now equipped with the tools to at least start trying to find a better way to navigate the world. The stance he ends up taking is naive, but the series effectively communicates that his new perspective is largely informed by PTSD (fighting at this point is a constant reminder of the 10+ years of killing people that he just got out of, and is clearly something that triggers him), and isn't necessarily ideal, but better than what he was doing previously. 

Canute works as an effective foil to Thorfinn through this season, as someone who has developed in the opposite direction. Their confrontation at the end of the season makes for an excellent culmination of what the season was building up to, resulting in neither side overtaking the other, but rather a middle ground between the two opposing ideologies that these characters have adopted at this point. 

I love that the end of the season sees Thorfinn finally returning to Iceland with Leif, and I think it resolves the character arc of the first two seasons in an excellent way.",False,anime,1708017107.0,1arkhdt,Discussion

Burnt out on anime to watch for a few years and need help!,"Hey all! I started watching anime when I was 15 and was (still am) a total Dragon Ball fanboy. But being 23 now and trying to get back into the medium, I feel as my options are slim but I know that's only because I hate the idea of picking through millions of different things that I might not realize I don't even like until the third or fourth episode. 

Here's a list of some anime that I've finished or seen a bit over the years:

death note - all, dragon ball - most, dbz - all, dbgt - some, dbs - all, orange - all, btooom! - all, noragami - all, noragami aragoto - all, fma brotherhood - some, akira, cowboy bebop - some, neon genesis - some, tokyo ghoul - seasons 1 and 2, opm - season 1, Saint oniisan - only bits from what I can find online, berserk - all of the movies and some of the 97 show, so basically the golden age arc, naruto - tiny bit, one piece - tiny bit, aot - some, my hero - didn't like, jjk - open to watching more, demon slayer - big maybe

I practice martial arts and so I tend to gravitate towards those shows more. I'm not opposed to over the top power scaling, but if there's a grounded martial arts anime I'd love to see it. After watching Berserk, I knew I wanted more. Vagabond stood out to me but there's no anime to my knowledge.

I'm open to anime with religious themes as well; Saint Oniisan was so interesting and funny to me when I first found it, so it's a shame I couldn't find it all. I'm open to being told ""just finish this one"" too since I know a couple of these that I haven't finished are big names. I'm just so lazy when it comes to finishing something that I just write it off as it not appealing to me in the end.

Thank you all so much!",False,anime,1708006665.0,1argf78,What to Watch?

"Now we're halfway through Winter 2024, how are we feeling about the shows so far?","Alright! Happy new year and happy new season. Now we're finally halfway through the winter season of 2024, I wanted to ask you guys how your anime watch experience is going! What have you watched that isn't currently airing? And just how have you guys been now so many things are happening all over the world (good and bad).

Honestly, when browsing what shows to watch this season, I initially thought this was going to be a dry season. I still think it is, but it's just dry in name as there are not a lot of big IPs going around. We got Solo Leveling and a couple of others, but not quite the juggernauts of previous seasons. But even then, I found myself watching quite a few more shows this season than the previous one. And that's with school. A lot more surprises, a lot more action, romance and a lot more-

**So gushing over magical girls is a thing....** I honestly went into this show expecting almost nothing. I knew it was gonna be a lewd take on the MG genre, but since the PVs were quite tame (In comparison)... I was just.... My jaw was just on the floor the entire first episode. This was the very first show I watched this year and that alone gave me the message. I was not to take this season lightly. This show I'd say is best described as what if a Chef made a recipe with the main ingredients being slice-of-life, comedy, Mahou Shoujo and Bocchi the Rock... Then dropped in chemical XXX. It's absurd and degenerate to its absolute core, but you know what? I ended up loving this show so so much. I wouldn't call it my favourite show this season, but I do find it the most fun I'm having. The characters have so much charisma (Utena has negative charisma which turns back to positive), the magical girls are all adorable and funny despite the things they're put though, and while the production isn't really keeping up with the intense action, the lewd scenes deliver.... The studio absolutely COOKED with this one. The Opening and ending are also really cute. Check em out. I'm giving this a solid 8/10, honestly. I didn't expect to like this show as much as I do. It's also hilarious asf.

But *surprisingly enough* Gushing over magical girls isn't the only *tits out* Anime airing this season, **Mato Seihei no Slave** is another one that... unfortunately I don't think is as good as GOMG. I remember watching the first episode and feeling like something was missing. That the show felt like it was lacking. Sure enough, when I checked out the manga, I realized what it was. The anime pretty much sucked all the life out of the manga. The Mato world isn't as ominously fantastical rather just a baren wasteland. The monsters are CGI abominations rather than scary monsters, and unlike Gushing Over Magical Girls which does around 45% action to 55% fanservice, Mato slave does like 85% action to 15% fanservice. Because of this, you really feel it when the action can't keep up. Production-wise, I'm really not feeling this show and I think I'll just continue off with the manga. Also Tenka overrated. Never really saw what made her special. 6/10 anime, 8/10 manga. Also, come to think of it, isn't this also an isekai? It only crossed my mind as was typing this out.

Well speaking of isekai! I'm only really watching one isekai show this season, and I think that's for the best. Cause... oh boy, this breathes a ton of fresh air to me. Let me tell, you **The Weakest Tamer Began a Journey to Pick Up Trash** is unironically one of my favourite isekai I've seen for a while now. With a title like that, I almost skipped this show cause I didn't think it'd be worth watching. But when I saw the PVs (and eventually the show), it turns out that it wasn't a ""generic powerfantasy isekai,"" this title just so perfectly represents the show when I'm so used to ""The weakest X"" actually being OP asf. Just seeing Ivy adventure and find her place in this world with Sora gave me such a euphoric feeling. THE PRODUCTION! DEAR LORD! What the actual fuck went behind the scenes of this show? it looks beautiful. Episode one gave me the same vibe as when I first played Genshin impact. Such a vibrant world it just touches and cleanses your soul. It's a completely different type of aesthetic compared to something like say Frieren or Mushoku, but it's by no means lesser. The animation isn't out of this world (but still really really good), but the compositing especially with the water is just *cheffs kiss.* Although, I do have some minor complaints, don't really think the super dark past felt... not necessarily earned, but felt like it took the show in a completely different direction. The 180 personality shift that was displayed during episode 3 I don't gel with. Instead of feeling ""oh no..."" it jolted my head a bit and took me out of the experience. Still, a good 7/10 for now. I heavily suggest checking out the OP and ED for this one.

Still even if not isekai, there are so many medieval fantasy shows airing this season. **Dungeon Meshi** is one I absolutely recommend. It gave me the same vibes as Campfire cooking in another world, but the dungeon just lended itself to a far more interesting world. The world building in this show is actually just insane and entertaining as all hell. The way they recontextualize all possible monsters into something edible is both hilarious and interesting. Forgive the out of pocket comapison, but it feels to me a lot like Interspecies reviewers. on one hand, the concept of that show is insane, but the way they build on that premise to deliver such an entertaining story and world makes it a genuinely great experinece even without the ecchi aspect. The same goes for Dungeon Meshi, even without the delectable foods, the world is interesting enough to keep me engaged the entire way. Also while I think the foods in Campfire cooking look tastier, Dungeon Meshi's catalog of creatures just puts it above imo. Solid 7.5/10 and has the potential to go higher if the story has something more to offer (Which I'm sure it does.)

I won't dwell much on **Sousou no Frieren 2nd Cour**, I know it's great. you know it's great, let's just watch the amazing show continue being amazing. I think Yorushika's OP vibes with me far greater than Yoasobi's OP. Reading both lyrics, it's clear that Yoasoibi's OP was made for Frieren as in the characters mention in the OP is just straight up the characters in Frieren, but Yorushika's song just sucked me in more. Anytime Anywhere by Milet is a masterpiece, glad it stuck around. Also, unlike the previous cour, this cour is now really honing in on a massive arc. Before just had a lot of episodic adventures, the mage exams are really interesting to watch. Though as of the moment, I do prefer the more mundane slice of life aspects of the show sprinkled with more himmel and occasionally darker threatning threats. The demon arc is still my favourite arc in the show so far. 10/10. 

Since I already mentioned Frieren, I'll do the same for **Mashle -Magic and Muscles- 2nd Season** Since I do think it's just more of what I liked in Season 1. There's no grandiose change that wll leave me speechless, but a fun show that I can just turn my brain off to and enjoy like a giddy kid. I will say, the production in this season looks like a step up from the previous season and..... \[[Click for one of the best Openings this season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=210R0ozmLwg&ab_channel=%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%8D%E3%83%AB)\] Holy hell that blew me away. Another good 7/10. Recommendation, if you have a kid brother, watching this with him might be a good idea. I got a tiny brother, he absolutely loves Mashle.

Next up is a very VERY different type of fantasy. While a lot of medieval fantasy revolves around JRPGs which are mostly inspired by DnD which is mostly inspired by Tolkien's Middle earth which is inspired by Norse mythology and old english epics, **Majo to Yajuu or the Witch and the Beast**, feels like it's taking inspiration from a completely different type or culture of fantasy. I always appreciate it when stories do that. It reminds me a lot of Ancient Magus Bride that it feels inpspired by more celtic folklore which I find to have a completely different flavour from Middle Earth fantasy. The show itself has a really good atmosphere, really good voice acting and while some things are unsettling, it never feels out of place for the type of world the story is set tin. I love all the cast of characters. It breathes so much life into the world seeing so many people operate. Though, since so much is left unanswered (large mystery show), I'm giving it a 7 for now. 

Okay, more ""Fantasy."" I'm putting this one in quotations because uh... this anime is just senseless. I can't make sense of what they want me to think of this world where things are just all mangled together. They have elements of stuff from modern day japan but has the story take place in medieval fantasy and just doesn't explain anything. Though I don't think the show really intends to at all. It reminds me of Alice in wonderland in that sense. **'Tis Time for ""Torture,"" Princess** is a show I did not really expect to enjoy so much. I thought it'd be a fun little show where I'd get tired of the gimmick by like episode 2, but to my surprise, I'm still very engaged and I want to keep watching more. The cast is endearing and it's clear they're not really going for any strong sense of realism here and more just giving the cast a happy time. It's cute and fluffy. I'm enjoying this one over the fluffy isekai too. Giving this a good 7/10.

And ANOTHER FANTASY! Jesus, so many fantasy shows. This one doesn't go that hard on the fantasy aspect though from what I've seen so far. **7th Time Loop: The Villainess Enjoys a Carefree Life Married to Her Worst Enemy!,** this one I really enjoyed the first episode of, but slowly started to lose interest as it went on. I think Riche is a very fun protagonist, but I'm not really getting invested in her as a person. recently I started going on a deep dive on Manwha's and webtoons to find the true villainess show for me, unfortunately this one just isn't it. I also don't think the brooding prince is all that interesting of a character. He looks like a copy & paste of so many other emotionless princes that came before him. I mean, I can't really name a single characteristic about him that makes him any different from the others. I don't necessarily find that to be an issue. I truly believe great execution beats unique concepts all day long- buuuut, I do wish I felt more for his character. Production is good though, that dance sequence was a joy to watch. Kinda sad I don't feel much chemistry between the Prince and Riche. 7/10. AH- I also have come to realize that I don't really like it when characters act so formal towards each other when romantic tension is being established. This isn't just an issue with 7-loop, I found it with so many other villainess shows as well.

.....Another fantasy- OKAY! Another villainess show too. **Villainess Level 99: I May Be the Hidden Boss but I'm Not the Demon Lord.** Okay, bias aside, I have no reason to say this show is any better than 7, loop. In fact, I feel this show is just... way worse? BUT! I'm enjoying this one so much more lmao. The character of Dolkness I just find so adorable partly because of her kuudere but loud in the inside vibe (giving me strong flashbacks to Aharen-san which I really loved), but also because it feels like a villainess show... that meets your generic power fantasy isekai. I love it. Mayu Maeshima also doing the OP puts a smile on my face. Her voice and style of music just resonates with me. 6/10. This still isn't the villainess show I'm looking for though. So far the closest ones I've been able to find were ""I am the real one"" and ""Villains are destined to die."" But they haven't reached it yet. Oh wait, I just realized this is also an isekai lol.

Yumiella from Villainess 99 is a massive gamer, that being a central trait of her character. It was fun to see her talk about how much she's training and grinding and farming for mats and fighting dungeons and bosses... But that is merely child's play compared to this next show. This show In my honest opinion has just pulled it off. THIS SHOW is the greatest JRPG Anime I've seen ever made, **Shangri-La Frontier's 2nd Cour** was an absolutely insane experience. As of right now, the show seems to have concluded its first major arc and... GOD DAMN! I don't think I'll ever find another JRPG Anime that can just top this one. Nothing. SAO's Aincrad, Log Horizon, fucking Shield Hero, any show that tries to implement JRPG elements like Status and all that stuff I find Shangri-La does better. This show gave me the same feeling I got with Mushoku Tensei. I felt like Mushoku Tensei was the pinnacle of your typical isekai fantasy. The basic premise of truck-kun hits hikkikomori and reincarnated to another world without gimmicks, but done to a masterpiece of an execution, I find that logic applies to Shangri-La as well. The greatest Video Game Anime ever made. Maybe I just missed something else massive, but I honestly don't see anything ever topping this for the next many many years. Fucking 10/10. 

I need to take a breather for a bit \[Real time\] as typing out that Shangri-La Segment made me remember the recent ep and it just made me so feel so much hype again just thinking about it.

ANYWAY! There's another show this season that feels very game inspired, but not quite JRPG (since it's Korean). Solo Leveling is really living up to its title as being one of the best powerfantasy shows I've seen in a long time. Most of the time... actually I think this is the first time I've seen a ""powerfantasy"" show where the MC trains...  A LOT to get stronger. Some other PF shows do this too, but a lot of the times, they just skip through or montage the hell out of the training segments. This one though... it SHOWS you and because of that feels so earned whenever Jinwoo gets a power-up. I won't really say this does the game mechanics as creative and as fun as Shangri-La, but god damn this show is a different beast in a differetn Area. A-1 Pictures absolutely killed it with the adaptation and as someone who's been reading the source as the episodes progress, I can safely say this adaptation while not having as good art as the manwha, easily surpasses it in story. The little additions they gave added so much life that I find myself more connected with the characters in the show. Jinwoo's JP voice actor did a phenomenal job and Hiroyuki Sawano absolutely nails the epic soundtrack that this. show. needs. I'll keep my score a 7.5 for now, but only because I know it's gonna keep rising just like Jinwoo himself. Also I heard a youtuber call this an ""alright"" show because they thought it didn't live up to the manwha, I jsut disagree lol.

Right, now we've completely moved on from Fantasy to more sci-fi. in terms of production, Studio Bones isn't holding anything back and we get **Metallic Rouge.** Honestly, while this show just has absoluitely amazing production and vibes, I feel like the story's losing me every episode. The script feels off, the banter feels unearned, and the ""crazy villain"" just doesn't have a presence for me. I don't know what is it with the script, it's just so odd the way things progress, and I'm not sure if its because I'm just not getting it, or something really odd is going on. Naomi and Rouge's banter also doesn't feel that earned. In a lot of ways, they give off a similar chemistry to Takina and Chisato from Lycoris recoil, the only difference here is that I saw Takina and Chisato slowly get close as the series went on so when they eventually talk, I feel so much chemistry between them both. Here.... episode 1 they meet face ot face of the first time, episdoe 2 they're already bantering like siblings who've known each other for a very long time. I mean, they do, but the story just skips over so much of that development that when one feels bad or tries to apologise to the other, I just don't feel it. The villains are also just empty. One villain acts super chaotic and ionsane, but it lacks any kind of scary feeling. He acts a lot like Petelgeuse from Re:Zero, but he just comes off as cringe. I'm not sure if that's because of the direction or the story just not making him seem as scary as he should be. And that's just so damn tragic cause this show feels like a combination of Trigun Stampede, Lycoris recoil, and a third Sci-FI show I just can't name atm. Maybe I'll get a Danny Devito ""Oh... I get it"" once I rewatch it, but Yeah, I'm giving this one like a 5,5 for now.

Next Sci-FI **Brave Bang Bravern!** I... didn't know what I was getting myself into when watching this show. I expected a seirious grim story a-la 86 then suddenly BRAVEEEEEERN shows up outta nowhere then turns Game of Thrones into Eminence in Shadow. It's like if John Wick was running around then he had to fight the fucking power rangers. I can't tell if this is a good show, or just an absolute wack one. Either way, the show never ceases to be funny, I'll give this one an 8/10

Switching up the genre now, **Sengoku Youko** has been a very interesting experience for me so far. This is the only show this season that I didn't start because of the premise of the series, but the behind the scenes look at both the author of the source material and the studio adapting it. I'm sure most of you know by now, but the mangaka for Sengoku Youoko, Mizukami once had another manga that was beloved by fans in Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer (Hoshi no Samidare). He'd been excitedly pushing for its anime adaptation for years even when he started doubting himself thinking that maybe it just isn't possible after all. So when news broke out that it was gonna get an anime adaptation, Mizukami was so happy, there were twitter tweets about it you guys can look up. But it was clear that after a while, he was not really happy with how the production turned out. He was listed as ""Series composition,"" but according to him, he barely had any creative control over the project. Essentially, he just watched his beloved work get butchered right before his eyes. It was tragic. And now the anime has a score of 5.65 in MAL and 49% in AniList. It really was tragic seeing things end up that way. On the other end though we had Studio Whitefox. The studio that once delivered banger after banger such as Steins;Gate and Re:Zero felt like it was on its last legs as it slowly started losing staff. Some moving to Studio Bind to work on Mushoku Tensei and some to Altrei Pondarc (which included the previous director of Re:Zero). Season 2 of Re:Zero while being a massive project they had to put out. After that they just stopped producing anime. For a while, Studio White Fox felt like a dead studio that wouldn't really produce any more big anime much like Shaft was (before the new Monogatari announcement and Madoka movie). So the amount of joy that hit me right in the face when I learned that Mizukami's other manga was gonna be adapted by Studio White fox. And when I learned that this production was a far healthier one which Mizukami himself seemed to be very satisfied with and the studio bringing in very well animated episodes every week. The joy I felt was just... DAMN! This feels unfair to put a rating now since I'm still in that high where I'm judging the show more for the BTS rather than what it is. So I'll refrain from giving a score for now. I still 100% recommend checking it out though..... ALSO ONE MORE THING. Jesus, they should just call this show Sengoku Revival cause the amount of returns this show gave! The Singer of the ED was one of the Lead singers of Kalafina, and she once again worked with Yuki Kaijura to deliver an absolute banger of song. God bless this f'ing show.

My rant there went a bit longer than expected. Next! Keeping things suuuper short. **Apothecary Diaries 2nd cour** is just as good as always. Love MaoMao, love the world building and just her being the best girl boss MC we've seen in anime for a while 8.5/10.

And the last show before I end things off. I have some shows this season that aren't really seasonal shows like Cutey Honey 73, Shin Cutey Honey, Spice and Wolf, and more, but I don't want to make this post any longer lol. Anyway, **The Dangers in my Heart Season 2** is just the same goodness from season 1, but they keep adding more sugar every episode that my heart can't take it anymore! I genuinely do think this show is one of the best Highschool Romances we've gotten in the past 10 years. It's not really comparable to Kaguya-sama since both are very different writing-wise, but The Dangers in my Heart is so damn good. The progression feels natural with no step-backs. The characters grow and mature as the series goes on. The MC doesn't feel like lil loser despite his design making him seem like he is. Yamada is more than just a glutton. It's so damn cute! I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE! 9/10. Could go up.

So... yeah. Overall, this season surprised me way more than I could've anticipated. I expected this season to be so dry, but I was instead met wtih so many unique flavours I wouldn't have gotten if I just stuck by the big hitters. Going in blind is sometimes really really good, huh..

Anyway, that's enough of this, what shows have you guys been watching? what do you think about this anime season so far? what are your favourites, likes and even drops. I'm curious if you guys feel the same way cause this was just a surprisingly banger season to me. Cheers!

Re-watched The Dangers in My Heart up to current.,"I've gotta say, this show is peak from start to finish. I've been loving the new season, but wanted a refresher for the first season, and I needed something I could watch in the background while I'm packing to move. I honestly had one of my best Valentine's Days yesterday just enjoying Yamada and Ishikawa together. And seeing the Valentine's Day episode really hit home too on the actual day. I don't normally do anything for myself on Valentine's Day, but this might become a tradition. Even just watching it by my lonesome was nice. This show promotes a lot of self love, while also giving some heartwarming romance. Highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.

The pick-up round will be open until the final results of the seasonal salt Fall 2023. Max to three votes per voter.

## Mini Challenge: 

* As we now have 41 of the 44 candidates of r/anime ‘s best girl of 2023 (Remaining 3 will be decided by pick-up round result, you can see the candidates from past 3 seasons [here.](https://saimoe.miraheze.org/wiki/Seasonal_Salt_2023)) Make some bold predictions about r/anime ‘s best girl of 2023! 
* BTW, FYI, best girl of 2023 would not be immediately held after fall seasonal salt, it would start in early APRIL because we all know the two major contender show of fall seasonal salt both have two cours and are still airing now, which would very likely make the results strongly skew towards the fall season if we hold best girl of 2023 right in Feb, so I would wait until them to finish airing to enable a more balanced competition.

"Help, I'm looking for recommendations","Looking for recommendations

I'm trying to be less picky with anime, but after watching a bunch if stuff I just didn't really like i want to take a break and hope to find something I will be more likely to like.

I'm looking specifically for something where the MC is some kind of demon, monster, vampire etc like supernatural type creature. Can be part or full that doesn't matter too much. They can become on later in the show or early on.
I prefer more action based and less romance. Don't really care if its dark or kinda silly. 

Some I've watched and enjoy are:
Blue Exorcist,
Tokyo Ghoul,
Yu Yu Hakusho,
InuYasha,
Fairy Tail,
Toilet Bound Hanako,
Rise of the Yokai Clan,
Seraph of the End,
Attack on Titan,
Case Study of Vanitas,
Soul Eater,
Kemono Jihen,
Chrono Cursade,
Demon Slayer,
Seven Deadly Sins,
Bleach,
Black Clover,
Black Butler

I know it's a rather specific request, but I've always loved supernatural things, and I just want to find something else that peaks my interest. I know there are quite a few that are supernatural but the MC just stays human and something about it bores me more than I care to admit.

If you could recommend something I'd appreciate it, can also be manga I'm good reading if its not animated yet.

Future Diary is underrated. Go watch it,"I unironically think Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) is an iconic, pivotal, and masterpiece quality anime.

1) Yuno Gasai is THE yandere. She's the character that has become the basis for the archetype of a ""Yandere"" in all of anime. Also name ONE battle Royale anime you can think of that was better executed than Mirai nikki.

2) The story is both engaging and well written. Great premise and combat mechanics. If you're watching Mirai Nikki, every episode is gripping and has you on the edge of your seat. Pacing is great. Minimal slice of life material, and almost everything that happens is relevant to the plot. It isn't predictable at all either, no one saw the plot twists coming.

3) The production quality is top notch. The sound design: the sound of diaries changing is haunting, the sound of explosions, and just sound effects are well designed. The soundtrack is amazing: watch the show and tell me the action scenes aren't hype thanks to the music. Animation is top notch too: great character design, fluid animation, and great shot composition. You at least have to give it that

The REAL reason people hate Mirai Nikki is because Yuno and Yukki are annoying. There's a solution to that: WATCH IT IN DUB.
- Yunos Japanese voice actress comes off as high pitched and whiny. Her American actress is a lot less annoying for American audience. People underestimate how big of a difference this makes. Same goes for yuki
- Yuki is roasted for being the most pathetic, weak protagonist ever. A lot of people mistakenly take this to mean ""bad character writing"". Yuki is SUPPOSED to be a pathetic, edgy, cringy loser. It's intentional for the plot. Notice how every other character has the same reaction to Yuki as we do: he's NOT supposed to be sympathetic and if you watch all the way through you'll see how he pays for choosing to be weak and letting yuno manipulate him.

Anime that is entirely flashbacks,"I'm wondering if there is an anime that's entirely based on flashbacks, meaning that a character from the future could be retelling it, or a character recaps the plot, or it's all apart of the character's memory, something like that.

My favourite example for this is Kakushigoto because it has a mysterious aspect to what happened in the future as we get glimpses into how the past is like.

If this counts, Teasing Master Takagi-san seems to be based off adult Takagi's memories sometimes, as we see her going through an album or remembering the past.

I guess Attack on Titan could count too, Armin is basically recapping/retelling to us

Quintuplets might count as the bride's memories because we see flashforwards of the wedding often

What are some more of these warm/bittersweet openings?,"What I mean by warm and bittersweet are these openings that use cuts of the characters just hanging out or going about their days to contrast other more serious things happening in the opening. Lately these are shooting up my list of favorite openings when everything is considered and not just the music or animation.

I found that these OPs tend to use gestures very well, which help to break out of the monotonous stock actions you usually see in anime like running, fighting, turning, just standing there, hand reaching, dropping into the water and all the clichés.

Do any of you feel similarly about this? What other openings do you know of that use this technique to help craft this sort of mood?

Looking for Anime that tell a complete story within 36 - 52 Episodes,"As time goes on, I start feeling like 2 cours just isn't clicking for me.

The ones I've seen like Steins;Gate and Summertime Render feel like reeeeally long movies (in a good way). But they don't feel like... A series, if that makes sense. 

2 cours (20 to 26 eps) just feel like it's not enough to give me that fulfilling experience. I want to feel like by the end of it, I did go through this long story with the cast.

So I'm taking anything that starts at the minimum of 3 cours (36 eps) to the max of 4 cours (52 eps). Max of 4 cours because that'll be an entire year's worth of anime in one Binge. Also also! Good pacing would be much appreciated! I can take slow shows, but **slow** shows I can't. My preferred genre (as of writing this) is the more fantastical adventure ones like Lord of the Rings, so having a more ""fun"" story works great, doesn't have to be mature. I'll take a children's story so long as it can be entertaining for people over the age of 12 (I'm 19). 

This season's Sengoku Youko I've heard will tell a complete story within 37 episodes. That sounds great. 

There can be some exceptions like FullMetal Alchemist brotherhood where it goes for 63 eps, but for the lost part still fits? (I say 52 eps, but if something can seriously give me the fulfilment of the FMA ending, I'd take things that go over.)

Seems like the Precure series all tell the main story within 52 eps, I'll check that out. Any genre is fine really. Horror, thriller, action, Shoujo romance, shonen romance, adventure, fantasy, you name it. I'm open to anything so long as its engaging... But no slice-of-life, at least nothing entirely slice of life. 

Death note can fit here. It really did feel like a long journey with Light.

Attack on Titan fits in terms of the progression I want. It feels natural and the conclusion is one thst feels conclusive instead of the ""open to more adventures"" type of ending, but it goes over 100 eps which is way more than what I'm looking for lmao. If I were to pull something from western works (aside from Lord of thr Rings), how to train your dragon 3 felt like a true ending. I'm hoping for something like that. An ending where the story truly feels like its run it's course. 

I'm fine with long shows, so long as the pacing is okay. The issue in found with a lot of old shows (as in shows pre 2000) is how stiff a lot of shows are. I suffered watching shows from the 60s and 70s.

The show being split into multiple seasons is fine too, so long as they ultimately tell 1 big epic story rather than each season feeling like their own contained season. So multiple seasons telling one big story rather than 2nd season or 3rd season feeling more like sequels than a ""direct continuation."" 

Stuff like One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail, ~~Boruto~~ or really most long running battle Shonen's are out. They all go over 100 episodes and most of the time are filled with filler and padding.

On the common complaints I see against revealing armor and gear in fantasy settings.,"I absolutely understand that minimal armor covering and form fitting clothing is less effective if you are only considering the pure protection that gear can offer a person.  If that is the only consideration, then every character should always be carrying a massive shield or just never go outside at all.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ygaqgm0jclic1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba1b118d2fa4ecdd0bbec41f09c2eddb6950a6f9

Consider the most common revealing attire you see people wear in real life, in public.  In my experience, it is fitness clothing.  Sports bras, muscle shirts, spandex shorts, small and form fitting items.  Why do people choose those clothes? Because they are easy to move in, which is also the most common response that characters use to explain their choice.  There is also the pride people get from displaying the fruits of their efforts, in the same way others can get from showing off their expensive fashion or other signs of material wealth.

If seeing any display of the things people are proud of is what makes you uncomfortable, I suppose this line of thought may not be very convincing.  But I think it is important to understand that most things in fantasy settings are metaphors for real world things.  For example, there aren't real dragons atop mountains of gold with a princess locked in a tower. But there are old rich people who hoard wealth and have partners that might appear to be unfitting matches for them.

Just something to consider. That said, I don't really hold it against anyone if certain things just make them uncomfortable.  I just think it is important to try to make sure your opinion doesn't ruin somebodies day and to consider their experience, too.

Help me with finding this anime please.,"Ok. I don't really remember a lot about this anime, so I might be mistaken about some details. 

The scene that I remember (and the whole reason I want to rewatch it again): one of the villain's closest aid is caught by the government, the aid is a snake women and is executed by beheading. The  villain essentially used her as a scapegoat and does nothing to rescue her. 

We move onto the next scene, villain is sitting in his office and hears a hiss sound (the noice snake makes, I don't remember if it was rattle or hiss sound). The villain thinks that his aid (the snake woman) has returned and welcomes her back. He turns his head to only be greeted by silence and remembering that he used her as a scapegoat and now somewhat regrets it.

The Way of the Househusband.It's about an ex Yakuza who retires to become a house husband (masculine equivalent to a housewife). I've heard the sub has bad translation, so watch the dub.

Ouran High School Host Club. It's about a poor girl with short hair that prefers mens clothing who accidentally breaks a Ming Vase on her first day of high school. To pay back her debt, she has to become a member of the school's host club. Where she has to pretend to be a man and roll play romance with a bunch of girls.

"Obscure movies like: ""The House of the Lost on the Cape""?","Hi everyone,

I have obviously watched all Studio Ghibli movies etc. but in September last year I stumbled upon ""The House of the Lost on the Cape"" I and I was blown away by how good it was.

There wasn't much info about it on the internet and so I wasn't expecting that it'll have supernatural elements in the form of kappa etc. as no descriptions of the movie even mentioned it.

The art style was amazing, animation was incredible, story very good and it had some of the best music I've heard in any anime.

I'm not really into watching any anime series aside of Dragon Ball when it comes out and I really only watch anime when my partner is away, since she doesn't like it at all. She's currently away for a week and so I wanted to watch some good anime movie.

Anime Opening / Ending SONG that gives You strong Nostalgic vibes even if You do NOT know (or keep in mind) the context of it.,"My picks (I recommend listening to the FULL versions, not the Anime formats):

&#x200B;

**Berserk's** Ending (""*Waiting So Long*""). It's naturally painful (which fits greatly within the context of the final episode, as well). Maybe too depressing, not leaving that much room for the ""sweet"" part in ""Bittersweetness"" that defines Nostalgia. It may seem more like Melancholy, I guess. But it still gives me the feeling of longing.

&#x200B;

**Oban Star Racers'** Ending (""*Waratteta*""). Probably the best one here after Berserk's, for me. Definitely better balanced than Berserk's, though. After the final episode of the show it hits even harder, just like Berserk's. And I'm not even a fan of this Anime ;p

&#x200B;

**Kill la Kill's** Opening (""*Sirius*""). It's so weird to have KlK here - an extremely action oriented over the top comedy show that doesn't have any particularly sad moments in it, but when I've recently started listening to the song separately, without looking at the images, I've realized how melancholic it is thanks to the chorus. 

&#x200B;

**Mushishi Zoku Shou's** Opening (""*Shiver*""). The official Music Video for this song is nice too.

&#x200B;

**Monster's** Ending (""*For The Love of Life*""). A really beautiful, hypnotizing piece.

&#x200B;

**Saint Seiya's** Endings (""*Blue Forever*"" and ""*Blue Dream*"").

&#x200B;

**Saint Seiya Hades'** Opening (""*Chikyuugi*"").

&#x200B;

**Shin Captain Tsubasa's** Opening (""*So Long Dear Friend*"").

&#x200B;

**Death Note's** Ending (""*Alumina*""). 

&#x200B;

**Shokugeki no Soma's** Opening **(""***Kibou No Uta***"").**

&#x200B;

**Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood's** Ending (""*Uso""*).

&#x200B;

**Naruto's** Opening (""*Namikaze Satellite*"").

&#x200B;

**Naruto Shippuden's** Openings (""*Closer*"" and ""*Diver*"").

&#x200B;

**Bleach's** Opening (""*Asterisk*"") and Ending (""*Mask*"").

Did Anyone See Ninja Kamui Premiere?,"What did you think of Ninja Kamui Ep.1? Was it what you expected? Will you be watching this one this season? Did anyone else think it felt like a 10 minute short?  I caught the episode premiere by complete coincidence Saturday night when I just found myself wanting to see what is airing on the Toonami block in current year. What did everyone think of this one? Ninja Kamui? I enjoyed the episode though from start to finish. I’m super interested in where the show goes from here! I hope it becomes a big show for the block! For anyone wondering it’s on Toonami and HBO Max.


Also, for anyone interested in what I thought of the Toonami experience in current year:


Toonami looked like it was in a sad state. There’s the popular series to be expected (DS, Naruto, OP) and Lycoris Recoil I’ve seen online, but there were also a couple series that looked like American cartoons being marketed on the Toonami block. I didn’t recognize them. I was disappointed the block ended early. It used to go until 4am CST when I remember InuYasha used to play. It ended around 3am instead. I also remember for a time it started earlier back when MHA was on the block. Going from the usual 11pm to 10:30pm CST. Is this what streaming has done to Toonami? I love streaming, but I feel bad for the Toonami block. I have so much nostalgia for the block even though I was always primarily an online anime viewer and only a sometimes Toonami viewer. It was still an experience to just watch an episode of a show on tv again without context of the rest of the series. I’m not caught up to DS. I only just started the Entertainment District arc.

I  pretty much skipped most of the final episodes. The sexual scenes with the little girl demon lord who they clearly referred to as a little girl was just icky for me. 😩

I know that anime will usually have some loli in it and if there’s like an awkward scene or 2 I will just fast forward. 

I watched most of DanMachi and was fine with it if that gives a reference of what I am okay with watching.

"what is the objectively, unmistakenably, officially crowned most weebiest anime ever?","lets scale from normie to weeb to absolutely lost to us weeb. lets find out together:

the formula for it is how big is the fanbase divided by how known it is in the anime scene plus the square root of how many foreign dubs it got&how many viewers the show got in other non japanese countries to the power of how hopeless you are to have watched it in full.

thats how i concluded durarara is about a 6 on the weeb scale, lucky star is a 7 and yosuga no sora is an 8.5

rules are:

1) just being an ecchi or just being a furry anime or the likes of that no matter how extreme isnt a dead giveaway. highschool dxd was still massively popular, just like how beastars is also pretty big
2) itd be too easy to just go on mal and go to the bottom of the top anime list. instead anime that are just blatantly obscure, look like lost media or had 0 effort in them and like a 100 viewers in general or are just really old dont count. you should still be at least somewhat able to make out an audience somehow
3) if any of you suggest smth like flcl, evangelion or akira youve literally lost your mind

Whats a mundane anime moment that you just can’t seem to forget?,"To elaborate on what i mean. Whats a moment in an anime that is completely normal, nothing really happens in the scene that significantly impacts the story or the characters but something about the scene just permanently etches itself in to your memory for whatever reason.

In my case and if we are talking recently. I can’t seem to forget the scene from the dangers in my heart season 1 where ichikawa buys this matching keychain thing with his sister because he intended to give it to yamada as a souvenir from his trip but his sister thought it was because he wanted to have a matching keychain with her. Long story short his sister found out he wanted to actually give his side of the matching keychain to yamada and she leaves her keychain with him so they can match after she realized that he gave his keychain to yamada even though his sister was already using the keychain and was happy to share it with her brother.

Two things made this scene so memorable for me. The sadness that his sister might have felt (i know its a headcanon because it isn’t directly implied that she was sad) knowing that it wasn’t meant for her or just how good of a sister she is for letting them match.

I know its a stupid thing to think about but i just cant seem to forget it",False,anime,1707870822.0,1aq9hzs,Discussion

opinion on ''rushed'' anime?,"a lot of anime adaptions are unfortunate enough to be rushed, for a variety of reasons.

&#x200B;

while i do find it annoying that a really great manga just didnt get the adaption it deserved, i also contradict myself by enjoying them regardless as a ''alternate story''

&#x200B;

an example of this is Akame ga Kill

&#x200B;

the anime was pretty rushed imo, with a lot of arcs not appearing whatsoever in the anime, and i'll call the anime the ''bad end route'', whereas the manga finished the story, had a ''good end route'' and also got a sequal.

unfortunately, if you only watched the anime, the sequal manga would NOT make sense at all.

&#x200B;

and that takes us to the next point, and where my greatest irritation lies...

&#x200B;

glorified ads for Light Novels.

&#x200B;

there are SO many manga and anime that has ended short because they were just commercial product to get people interested in the Light Novels, one that i was so dissapointed was treated this way was ''Chivalry of a Failed Knight'', with the anime getting an even lamer treatment (aside from obvious good production value), i just find it annoying that a good story thats come far is now axed because they dont need it to commercialize anymore.

lf animes with a very specific edgy vibe,"don't exactly know how to explain it other than edgy and pretentious highschoolers daydream but in the best way possible. Cringe culture is dead <3

examples I can think of are code geass, pycho pass, death note, tomodachi game, no game no life, akuma no riddle, angel of death, banana fish, madoka magica, magical girl raising project etc

animes like monster also fit here,but I am looking for something that requires less braincells and more entertaining

basically edgy, smart and morally questionable mcs or those that are  narcissists with god complex (but also the type of character that will be worshipped on tumblr).

bunch of mind games, better if the mind games involve life or death situations, doesnt actually have to be smart or well written just should be important for the characters

generally dark and angsty vibes, better if the genre is horror but not necessary. 


also it would be great if it has some form of friends to enemies, enemies to friends/lovers, or some heartbreaking betrayal

if you read so far,  it would be great if you can drop some animes down. I do watch anime often, so more obscure or older titles are welcome.

Askeladd's back must hurt from carrying season 1 of Vinland Saga,"Askeladd? More like Askechad. This man is the real main character of season 1, having more personality and depth in his fingertips than Thorfinn does in his entire being. Sad that he dies, but I understand why the death was necessary to revive the flat line that was Thorfinn's character arc throughout this season. Second half of the season was definitely better than the first, but I'm still wondering why they chose to make the protagonist the single worst character. The emotional beats of that death scene don't really hit when the protagonist has been insufferable the whole time and there's no reason to really care about his journey in the aftermath of the far more interesting character's death. Season 2 may pleasantly surprise me, but I'm not expecting much.

Her outfit is a striped blue and white shirt, and blue baggy pants. She was probably wearing sandals I think? And her character seems to be that she's scared

The one clip I came across was them jumping into the ocean to escape from some monster of sorts, but they have magic to breathe underwater, they observe some of the ocean life for a bit, until their supposed mentor comes by and takes them to wherever they need to go.

"If Light Yagami from Death Note, as Kira existed in this world today and was able to accomplish what he did in the show would you cheer him on?","Yes Light was a POS. But doesn't the end justify the means?

Objectively didn't light save millions of people? Is that not justified?

Option A) Light kills 10000's of criminals with a some innocent dying. But he stops all wars and 70% of global crime = millions of people are saved.

Option B) Light does nothing. Our current justice system puts innocents in prison/on death row (4% estimated on death row), wars continue on and the crimes continue on. 

Also our current justice system doesn't convict politicians or people who start wars. Light would.

Isn't Option A just objectively better?

Here's another scenario:

Let's say you are driving and are about to run into some pedestrians.

Option 1) Do nothing and hit an a group of 4 women

Option 2) Turn your car and instead hit a single man.

Option 3) Attempt to stop your car with the possibility of causing an accident and possibly endangering or saving both lives.

I also remeber one of the episode plot was a concert/roadshow was under attack and one of the main characters lost his/her gadget and had to scramble to find it, and then the team arrived and kicked butt etc etc,

It could only be a one off episode in another show, i really cant remember, i was in the US and it aired between 1990-2010, or it could be on VHS tapes, i think i remember it having a english dub so it must have been localized.

Does anyone remember Angel Tales?,"One night, I was scrolling through Tubi looking for a new anime series to watch and then I stumbled upon Angel Tales. It’s an anime about an unlucky unemployed man in his mid-20s, named Goro Mutsumi, who has trouble finding a job and is down on his luck until one night, he meets a group of teen girls who suddenly appear in his living room and they are his guardian angels who want to be of service to him. These girls are actually his previous pets that past away and were reincarnated into human angels, and their mission is to serve, protect and take care of him. Some of the girls had romantic feelings for Goro and were fighting over who gets to feed/cook for him, buy him medicine, make sure he’s safe, etc., but they were supposed to work together in being at his service, regardless if they were attracted to him. 

I really liked this anime even though I haven’t finished it all. It’s very adorable, sweet, charming, and childlike but it gets sad at times, especially when the girls talk about how they died as pets. This anime is 22 years old (aired in 2001) and I’m just now finding out about it. I highly recommend it to those who love cute or “childish” anime or magical girl, but I wouldn’t call it magical girl since the girls didn’t transform or didn’t have goals regarding saving the world. Their only goal was taking care of Goro. There’s 12 episodes and it’s available on Tubi.

art by anrio -- a collection of some of my favorite characters drawn beautifully,"A fun way I've found to cement my love a show/character is to commission art of characters that I like...it's great! You get a bunch of great art, and you get to support real, human artists. You should all do it, regardless of who you commission!

Over the last...year and a half or two, I've ended up commissioning a lot of art, and in particular, a lot of art from an artist whose work I really love, anrio!

https://imgur.com/a/1PLCPqv

(actually, one of these got posted almost a year ago https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/12xif3u/i_drew_rem_from_rezero/ that was my commission ;)

Regardless, I really love anrio's style. I think it is true to the anime visual style, but also has a sort of...distinct, fashion inspired look to it? I dunno. I just keep coming back with characters I care about, and he keeps making incredible art. I also like artists who draw in a more traditional anime/manga way and have commissioned many, but I appreciate anrio's particular style, I think it's absolutely gorgeous

(note: I did ask anrio if he was cool with this but this was completely on my initiative, not his.

Ironically No blood when a character gets injured, 2. friendship power), but it's one of my first anime, at the time I watched it i was a lving masterpiece, the medieval-themed OST makes me literally experience euphoria, No anime **ever** beats fairy tail in OST's )
3. Tokyo Revengers: It has one of the best openings in the history of anime, The magical emotions I felt while watching it, The amount of tears I shed, The liberating experiences It made me undergo, The dramatic personality of Takemichi, The legendary delinquent, gang street fighting theme that was unheard of before
4. OP: Anyone who has watched long running anime, knows the profound bonds you develop with the characters, The way the drama is expressed here, is legendary, Luffy's character development is #1 in the history of anime
5. Date A Live: the G.O.A.T romance drama  + really great battles

Why do people love anime so much? not trying to hate," 

I have been wondering why people are so in love with anime and i am not trying to talk shit or hate.  


I have some friens i play games and talk to a lot in discord and they watch a lot of anime together in there but i never get the feeling that i like any of them, and i know many of you will say ""you have not found the right one yet"" but i have seen so many different ones now by just watching what they watch in discord its been animes like JJK, Hunter hunter, AOT, solo leveling, Spy x Family, Love is war and the list goes on

And i was wondering what makes people so obsessed with anime? Like i said i am not trying to talk shit or hate but for me from the outside people who watch anime are kind of like vegans, its all they talk about and only thing they talk about on the internet, all the pfp that they use is anime ones and all the gifs is always anime ones, I think its nice people have found something they really love and for me that is Lord of the Rings i watch that shit so many times a year i even watch so much lore videos to learn everything about it but i am not throwing it around everywhere that i love Lotr or even if i meet another guy that also loves it i just be like ""oh shit nice me too"" and i move on but i feel like a lot of people who love anime only talks about anime

So if anyone of you guys out there have any answers from your pov on what makes you be so ""obsessed"" with it

My friend may see this and i am sorry for that xD",False,anime,1707820954.0,1apqkrn,Discussion
