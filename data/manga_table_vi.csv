Dad looking for manga for struggling teen son,,"I have been reading multiple post, searching for advice on what to get for my son. My son, 16, is struggling with deep, depression and addiction. He recently has gone off to a therapeutic boarding school to help him heal his trauma and pain and learn to live in sobriety. He has attempted suicide more than once. Thank God for divine intervention.

I am looking for advice on a series that can help him through this rough time without it being so obvious that it’s self-help that he loses interest.   He used to liked anime’s such as Naruto, one piece, demon slayer.  More recently the anime that I’ve seen him watching seem much more dark. I definitely don’t want to go that direction.

I am looking for recommendations on Manga that can inspire him and help him to not feel alone, but also help him to get out of his own head. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",False,manga,1707687841.0,1aojf11

I was browsing in facebook and suddenly remember the manga i read years ago, I think I was 10-12 years old when I read that manga, i'm not really sure since that was long time ago.

So about this manga I will only tell the scenes that i remember, it's not clear tho so it's not accurate but i hope you can help me find it since i really want to reread it again.

There is a male lead, he has dark hair i think and wearing glasses, i think he is still a student and he has a brother (im not sure), he is just walking and then suddenly he passed by in a street where someone is fighting..... (fast forward, i don't remember the next) , he met a girl who is good with katanas, the girl was raised up in a dojo, and is still living there, i think the girl is also his classmate that don't go too often in school since she go out and fight most of the time ( again, im not sure sorry, lets fast forward the story ), he has superpowers ( i'm not sure if he knows, he hide it, or he don't know, i don't remember sorry 😭) his super powers is super strong, maybe its already obviously since he is the male lead, sorry i don't remember what power he has ( fast forward again ), he met people that has super powers , ( i think i remember now, he can imitate the powers of others, not sure again ),  so the people that i remember that he met is, 

1. The girl in wheel chair (not sure if she's really in wheel chair
2. Man with apple head
3. The cat in a suit/clothes
4. Immortal man ( i think he is wearing a military clothing)

That's all i can remember, there is more but i don't remember now

So the last chapter that i read that i remember tho im not sure again is when they formed an alliance with the people he met, then they have war, he fights , that's where i remember those character , the cat with clothes , the man that has immortality power, and the girl in a wheel chair

That's what i remember, sorry if my story is not clear, i'm not really sure of the story since i read more manga and i think my mind was messed up and im confused,  so im not really sure about it, but i hope you can help me, thank you ❤️",False,manga,1707660599.0,1ao8s3d

I read a story a while back that was in early chapters and I guess I never added it to my mal or bookmarks cuz I can't find it again

It's a villainess manhwa about a girl getting reincarnated into a tragedy she read, and the character she becomes is this little girl with purple hair who gets adopted into a powerful family where the potential heirs are encouraged to destroy each other to prove their worth. The protagonist was adopted to prove to the biological children that nothing is guaranteed, and if they don't quit acting entitled then an orphan off the street might take their birthright

I think she also gets some kind of power that makes her eyes turn red.

Looking for the title of this BL manhwa:,,"Hi everyone, 
I'm looking for a manhua I read, two years ago maybe. The site was suspended, and you know how it goes: you lose your library.
I would be really thankful if you find the answer!
So, the protagonist is an alcoholic model with silver hair and a terrible character. He's despised by everyone and hated by his co-workers. He meets a brown hair guy who owns the hotel where he is taking pictures (almost drawn in the swimming pool due to the heat).

Help finding a manga i read a long time ago,Tantei Gishiki,"When i was a kid i received a volume of a manga on a con i went to, and ive been trying to find it for the last decade with no luck, so figured that posting here would be my last resort, since i can only remember little fragments of it (i read it back in 2007/2008)


It was very gory, it was a group of dudes that investigated crimes, the most prominent feature that i can remember from them was that one had a Punk looking hairstyle,a bdsm ball on his mouth and would kiss the dead to find out how they died.


Last thing i remember from it was the end of the first volume,where the group was brought to an island at night where there was a lot of people performing a ritual of sorts,they got their faces covered and after taking the hoods off everyone else on the island was dead on a pretty gruesome scene.


Any leads or help would be inmensely appreciated, if i was able to find it i would be so happy, still intrigued on how it continued",False,manga,1707604029.0,1ans7jh

Hajime No Ippo Creator Speaks Against Anime Studios Tweaking The Original Plot Of Manga,,"On February 7, the author of popular manga Hajime No Ippo, George Morikawa, reaffirmed his unwavering support for the rights of people who created their original creative works via a Twitter post.

In the post, he expresses that it is important to preserve the author’s creative vision, and they will always believe that they will always have a final say in it.

He also highlights that the purpose of the laws is to protect the proprietary rights and authority of the original writers in their work.

Morikawa states that although readers, editors, and adaptators could shed light on previously published materials, only the original creator knows the future of the story.

For this reason, they should have complete control over their work.

He further states that the original artists might be given the freedom to exercise their legal rights to the unrestricted maintenance of their intellectual properties.

Morikawa, however, also indirectly targeted anime studios for changing or adding their interpretation to the manga creator’s work.

***“The reason is absolute because the original author is absolute. Just as before, this message is also for aspiring manga artists. Despite facing backlash, authors have continuously asserted their absolute authority. The rights of primary creators, including manga artists, novelists, and screenwriters, are protected by law. And what’s crucial is that only the original author knows the future. That’s why it’s absolute.***

***Everything that editors and adaptors, including readers, see, is already in the past. Only the original author knows what the future holds. This is even more true if the series is still ongoing and unfinished. Any alteration, intervention, or adaptation of the past will erode the present and affect the future. That is why it is important to discuss and give your opinion. What is needed is respect, gratitude, and courage, not an overbearing attitude. The future that the work and its readers look forward to should not be ruined or lost because of the bending of others who only know the past. Only the author can protect the work’s future.”***",False,manga,1707564190.0,1ane7su

Any manga recs similar to chainsaw man?,,"Does anybody have any recommendations for a series similar to chainsaw man? Personally, i think makima is truly one of the best written antagonists i've ever read about in a manga, how manipulative she is and downright creepy, without all the typical anime style machismo and theatrics and i'd love to read about something similar in another series.

The art is also SO FKNKN GOOD like you'll go from panels feeling kinda shaky and half drawn, which add to the chaotic style, to a super elaborated 5 point perspective panel of denji and power sitting in the subway (that or just some beautiful grotesque gore demon with crazy design).

Need help looking for a manga,,"I read this manga a while ago and I cannot for the life of me remember what it was called or find it through google. 
This is going to be all over the place, but all I remember is a boy starts his life as a civilian(maybe even a farmers son) and has level 0 powers. People can have all sorts of levels and different powers. There are monsters(I think low level demons/goblins). Somehow he becomes strong and has a girl join him (I think she was the princess) and more people(mostly girls I think it was a harem) join him. If I remember right he meets the hero’s the king favors and they’re rude to him. He finds ways to work around stuff like he had to fight this big knowledgeable dragon/monster and instead of doing the puzzles to open the door he just dug a hole to it. He also ends up getting a little demon girl on his team but demons are killed so they hide her horn with a ribbon. This is possible spoiler but he finds out if you kill the demon king the world is reset and he doesn’t want that to happen so he doesn’t kill the demon king. Him and his team also need money so they open a restaurant/cafe/casino? The last thing I remember is he starts a war with the king because he doesn’t want to reset the world.",False,manga,1707545714.0,1an9pzf

Manga Collecting,,"Wassup reddit, this is my first post ever and I wanted to ask y'all if you have some recommendations for me!  
I started watching anime a few years ago but I only started reading manga on 2023.  
I've watched a few anime (Berserk \[90's version\], Hellsing ultimate, AoT, Demon Slayer, Inuyashiki, Undead Unluck, Jjk, Mob Psycho 100, 91 days, Chainsaw MAn, Death Note, Deadman Wonderland, Banana Fish, Biao Ren and many others...) but because I've only started reading manga a couple of months ago my collection is still slim. I've got all of Death Note Black editions, Monster 1st vol. , 3 Tokyo Ghoul Vol., 3 jjk Vol, One Punch Man also 3 Vol. , Gannibal 1st vol., Uzumaki, Chainsaw man 12 vol., and a couple of more mangas that were translated to portuguese (samurai and shinobi stories like 'O preço da desonra' and 'Butterfly Beast'). I've tried to get my hands on Dorohedoro and Inuyashiki but it's hard. I've read all the mangas I have (except I'm only now finishing Monster vol.1).  
I've read Fire Punch online and I absolutely loved it. I also love Chainsaw Man.   
So, you've seen I kinda like R rated mangas and gore and stuff like that, so do you have any recommendations for me?

Spoilers follow... 


Later on its revealed he was abused by his female teacher / mentor? years back. 

Muuuuch later in he moves home partly to escape her return (might be hazy on deets) into a house linked to the main girl's family. Later on a bunch of the students decide to start cooking for him and spying on his activities.

Looking for specific recs as a beginner,,"Hey guys, 

I’m someone with a learning disability that has struggled reading all my life but am really wanting to try manga as I enjoyed comics as a kid. (I’m 25)

I’d like some recs based off some of the anime I watch - I am looking for some that do NOT have an anime and are completed (or 100% will be) 

I am someone typically really into fantasy from isekai to complete high fantasy, I also enjoy slice of life. The following variables are what they would need to have, (please remember these are my preferences and if you don’t agree with them kindly don’t comment. I’m looking for help not hate or elitism.) 

Yes I know I could look this up but I’d much rather communicate with real people not AI made websites 

The must haves:

-romance (very important) the anime the devil works as a part timer captured EVERYTHING for me. As well as how a realist hero rebuilt the kingdom (one of the funny and one of the less funny ones I enjoy on the anime side)

(I don’t want direct misogyny but I do find animes that make fun of some tropes to be funny) I.e Konasuba | Iruma kun

-humor (I greatly prefer humor and comedy but having it as a very loud theme is okay too) 

-Fairly light hearted, I want to smile more than feel depressed, I use anime and would like to use manga as an escape

-balanced (up to interpretation) 

-not a ton of death (especially in main characters) (though I am goth and enjoy the theme of mortality and can handle it)

The must NOT have:

-completely macho themed, I don’t want a predictable macho guy plot or “bro vibe” 
-cannot just be violence (I prefer it to be about 50% or less)
-I’m not into space, modern military, and most especially not post apocalypse 
-I also do not want ANYTHING to do with sports as a main theme please. It’s fine if it’s in it some for let’s say a highschool sports episode or something but it cannot be a theme. Modern is already pushing it enough but I loved the love is war anime so I’m trying to be flexible 

Preferences: (would be nice) 

-little gothic (but does not have to be) 
-silly goofy 
-some complexity to it (optional) 


Really wanting something to help hook me into Manga and motivate me to keep reading (one of the reasons I would like ones without an anime)

Finding Manga - MC wears a mask with buttons as his eyes.,,"I am looking for a manga that I read during work. I don’t remember the title nor character name sorry but I do remember some panels and plots so please help me find it.

First chapter started with a boy saw a beautiful lady in her mainson/house. Then he got invited to her house. Saw she was naked on the sofa then his classmate, another boy with glasses, close the door behind him. As the door closed, the lady jumped and attacked the boy, ripped his heart out and let the 4 eyes kid pressed the juice out of it and poured it in her mouth. 

The boy now lured more victims for her and one of the classmates became her victim again, saw a bracelet on his hand, instead of kill the boy this time, she ripped the four eyes mouth and killed him. Cut the boy legs then chained him up. He now looked horrible, scars, his hair turned white and his skin falling off.

He realised he had became a monster like her. He went to met his lover accidentally killed her, ripped off her hand. He brought her to a police to bring her to hospital. He also learnt that in order to remain the beauty and look like normal, he had to kill human and drink heart. He did and also use it to save his girl. As the result, they’re both monster. 

As the story progresses, we learnt that the 4 eyes still alive and he became a monster. When he transform he looks like a joker on cards. Through him, we know that there are only 4 pure blood monsters and they are 4 sisters.",False,manga,1707435050.0,1am9ml4

Looking for a manga with a good romance b plot.,,"I know this is kinda weird but I whole heartedly believe I've read every good romance manga out there. I'm a huuuge fan of romance anything. Now I'm kinda looking for romance in different situations, more specifically something like shounen or battle manga but with actual good romance storylines. 

I'm currently reading solo levelling and I'm pretty far in, I was pretty interested in jin woos romance with hae in, however I don't see that going anywhere. At first I really liked that she was shown as someone more powerful and I loved that, I absolutely loathe the knight in shining armour trope. Except jin woo pretty much becomes everyone's knight in shinning armour by the end (ngl not really liking solo levelling but it's a fun guilty pleasure read). 

I basically want something like that but where the romance is more fleshed out (or atleast somewhat fleshed out, not expecting much because it will be the b plot). The only similar one I can remember is sword art online. Sao was kinda bad but I loved the parts of them just hanging out as a couple separate from the story, that's the kinda thing I would love to see. Like a good A plot but also breaks with these characters hanging out and falling in love. I can't think of anymore anime or manga like that tho. 

Also the woman being stronger than the man isnt a must, I just kinda hate it when the man comes in running to save the woman. Thanks in advance cos I know finding a shounen/battle manga with actual good romance plots will be tough (cough cough sakura sasuke).

Edit: accel world is one I just remembered and really enjoyed.

Looking for the Title of this Manga,"Gift ""Mugen Gacha"" de Level 9999","Hi All , 
I hope you can help me out, I had thought I had bookmarked it but turns out I didn't and it's bugging me now.
It starts with our ML is with his party in the Dungeon and they use him for bait to escape or maybe feed him to monsters and as he is begging for a saviour he summons a maid a think who is his advisor or helper, I think he had to be in danger for the skill to activate, she saved him then they go on to build a huge army in the dungeon, he might turn out to be the dungeon master I'm not sure, but his goal is the take his new family out of the dungeon and take revenge on the team that left him in the first place, I'm pretty sure it's a harem tag too, as his main team are girls who fight in different ways with various skills, I had read it up to the point where they were scouting out the town outside the dungeon, and had met one of two of the team that betrayed him.

"How hard do you think it would be for a foreigner to get serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump, let alone at all?",,"I'm an aspiring teen just starting out high school, and my ultimate dream is to be able to get a manga serialized in WSJ one day.

1. As a foreigner, specifically an African American/Colored foreigner, how hard do you think it generally is to get your manga serialized in Japan, considering you are fluent in Japanese (JLPT level 1-2 fluency), have worked in the industry for some time, and have good-great art and storytelling?  

2. If there IS any xenophobia/colorism amongst manga serializers/publishers, do you think that by the time I'm an adult, let's say in 10-25 years, that this problem will get any better?  

3. What steps do you think that I should take at my stage to greater my chances? (I'm pretty good at art but I know that I can be way better, and I plan to work on that, and I'm also pretty good at writing and storytelling but I know I can get better at that too). Any recommendations?

&#x200B;

4. Other thoughts, ideas, opinions, and advice welcome!

&#x200B;

TLDR: As a determined aspiring teen with a dream to have a manga serialized in WSJ, I acknowledge the challenges as a foreigner and person of color. Despite the potential obstacles like xenophobia and colorism in the industry, I am devoted to improving my art and storytelling skills and seeking guidance to increase my chances of success.",False,manga,1707363369.0,1alma1a

Doesn't seem VIZ is interested in picking up the series again for the west which breaks my heart. Maybe if enough of us draw attention to it they might change their mind.

This shit was so fucking hype at times and it was seriously one of the better sleeper shonen hits of the early 2000's. I can't express how much I loved it. 

I've tried collecting it and I'm getting close to having all the volumes but I've hit a snag. I have every English volume that was released but volume 2 is so elusive. No matter where I look I always find the other volumes but not #2 unless it's for a stupid price with high shipping rates. Any idea why this is? Did they just not print that many of that volume?

When he revives he uploads an advanced mech blueprint to the super ai and is given a king rank within the goverment. It's then also revealed that there's a martial realm he can transfer to In.

So he works hard in both the martial realm and his realm to try and avoid the Demon apocalypse in his world from the future.

Does anyone happen to know the title of this manga?,,"Hey community,

I'm searching for a short manga I read on the internet a few years ago. I loved the atmosphere and would love to dive into it again. Here's what I can remember:

It's set in a dystopian future where all of humanity has become androids, suffering from this condition. They are obsessed with becoming human again.

The story follows a human boy, probably the last of his kind, on his quest for survival in an android city where everyone is hunting him to acquire parts or all of his body.

There's an android that help to defends and hide him. This android looks like a detective or something and is the secondary character of the story.

As the story progresses, the chase becomes more intense, and the boy is convinced he needs to turn into an android as well to defend himself. Meanwhile, his android protector tries to convince him not to do it.

In the end, >!the boy surrenders himself to the android boss of the city, wanting to gain power. The android boss sees an opportunity to become human again, so they attempt a transfer. The manga ends on a cliffhanger, but it's somewhat implied that the android boss died and the boy is now the new android boss.!<

"stuff similar to ""The Lone Necromancer""",,"I know this is pretty much a Solo Leveling clone. those arent the aspects im looking for more of though. although i dont necessarily want to avoid them, im more looking for the following aspects.

&#x200B;

1. MC isnt the strongest. in this, he's definitely OP. but so are other characters.
2. Other characters still grow and develop.
3. The characters are developing the world around them (building communities, clans, etc)
4. MC is not ""chosen"" or special. they had the same opportunity as everyone else, and either worked hard or got lucky.

OP MCs seem to be the most popular for a lot of stuff right now, but its always been boring to me. ive found a few good ones where they develop the characters well, but very few actually take the time to do it. any suggestions that might be enjoyable?

others ive read and really enjoyed.

The image, roughly translated, says this:

>This is FANZA doujin support, thank you for your continued support

>Thank you very much for registering your work.

>We apologize to the circle, but

>In accordance with the copyright owner's wishes,

>We are refraining from handling works that parody the following elements.

>■Parody element: Frieren at the Funeral

>We would like to inform you that due to the reasons above, the publication status of the work in question has been suspended

>Thank you for your continued support of FANZA Doujin.


Truth be told, I don't know if this is newsworthy enough for the subreddit, it's just something you don't see too often nowadays, at least for bigger series. I don't know if it’s limited to R18 doujinshi, but considering FANZA is the only place we know of that's been hit with this, it could be. And I don't know if the copyright holder, Shogakukan, is the one pushing for this, or the author.

I'm uncertain if other distributors are affected",False,manga,1707243837.0,1akgldt

1. The main character has ancient tech hidden in his body (arms) that shows up at times and he had to learn to train to use them
2. This tech has a core that it runs from/like a battery and if destroyed, it deactivates
3. There's a fighting competition where they fight, and at some point they are on a floating island that starts breaking and falling out of the sky
4. There's a female character with tentacle/octopus powers and she is quite strong
5. There is a character who can fly using tech in his shoes, I believe and he uses explosives as well
6. There is a character who has a power where a dragon type creature hides underground and that's where the core is. He is apparently a murderer or the son of a murderer.

But anyway, this one I also need help with as I forgor and is similar to my previous post that ive been looking for this for quite awhile now xd. The front cover was a cliche big booba woman but she is a fox girl and has red hair?? I thought at first it was a slice of life but no it was modern day fantasy superpowers kinda genre/gimmick. The MC was a dude who was a completely normal guy until he met this woman in distress and decided to take action by literally slamming a dude's head with a fire extinguisher (I am just explaining this in memory of the chapters I can still remember and this is just coming out of my ass so im sorry if im wrong).  


They regrouped at his house, the woman decided to live rentfree with him (damn) although he was kind of opposed to it. Cant remember the rest but I remember him dying and turning into another version of himself that has super powers similar to Black Flash in JJK it having black and red colors but evil, until such time the fox woman convinced the evil version of himself to come back to his original body that was stuck in the bathtub..? iirc, when he revived he had new super powers that were more blue than red and was now considered an orphan since the public records counted him as deceased.  


One other character I remember on that manga/manhwa was an astolfo kinda guy (a trap), he wore a wig on one mission to lure out their prey with the mc and their super powers were purple claw energy.",False,manga,1707233420.0,1akcg3h

Looking for a certain Manga,,"Hello, 

Im sorry if i didnt post in in the correct reddit but i figured this would be the best spot to ask. 

So im looking for a manga that ive read years ago and totally forgot about it, its about a world where Robots took over the world and the royal family governing the world had been killed except for the prince who has been living incognito. 

Then there is a girl who pretends to be of royal descent and eventually they meet up and try to fight against the robots. The deal is the girl pretends to be a royalty while the real prince will find out how to deal with the robots or something like that, and he has a pet i believe? With some megaman like ability? 

If anyone could help me on the way that would be much appreciated! ",False,manga,1707212691.0,1ak63zg

what is the ratio of mangas b&w to colored ones?,The plural of manga is manga.,"i don't know if i construct my title right. i just wanna know how vast the colored mangas are in today's market. like do the so called popular (old popular and new popular) mangas do already have colored version? i wanna know what's the percentage. 

i'm planning to get my very first ereader and one of its use is for reading manga. i can't decide yet if i'd go for a colored version or a b&w one. colored version ofcourse is great but it has its cons too. being more pricier than b&w, lowbats faster, noteciable ghosting when page flipping, etc. honestly, i could live with the cons, it's just that if it's worth considering unknowing how many colored version of mangas available in the market and the additional 30% cost than the b&w. if there are a few available colored mangas now, say only 20% available, then i'd choose the b&w one",False,manga,1707209552.0,1ak5eq9

Would you recommend I start at Vol 1, or am I good to skip that being that just watched the anime?

What happened to her father ? When freya was breaking he was alive and even when  edna or chii transfered freya to herself he was alive but when hideki finds chi he's dead/gone . 

Characters  like dragonfly and 2 persocons that resemble the landlady and her husband dont even do much for the plot.


The government is involved plot kinda leads to nothing?

Her ability is to make persocons make their choices or have feeling ? I couldnt understand even after reading again . What happens to freya now?

Hope someone who has read it can clarify to me . Much thanks☺️☺️",False,manga,1707201452.0,1ak3hj6
Help finding a oneshot,,"As the title says, I'm trying to find a oneshot I read quite a while ago but never saved, I know how the story goes but I can't for the life of me remember the name. Here's the story:

The MC is a boxer, though he has never won any matches, and due to him dedicating all his time to boxing his girlfriend broke up with him. He meets her again after some years pass and is still in love with her so he invites her to see his last match as a boxer telling her that if he wins he wants to tell her something/confess. She shows up for the match and of course he loses, so then he packs up all his stuff and goes to her house to leave a letter on her doorstep before he presumably leaves town. The girlfriend opens the door as he's about to leave and they reconcile.
