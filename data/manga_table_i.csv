(Not a joke) what would be an appropriate manga for a toddler?,"
I realise how crazy this sounds - but I (31 M) have never met my nephew. I live in the UK and my sister and her family live in the Oceania. He's obviously young, but from what I gather, very intuitive and smart. I used to read a lot of books myself from a young age and became engrossed in all kinds of books (text, comics, manga etc) when I first encountered them. I'd like to gift him a manga, or even a graphic novel, that he could read at his age (or even a little older!) so I can plan a reading list that I can agree on with my sister. We were both of the age when Sailor Moon and the like hit the cable channels so are familiar with Japanese media like anime, saw manga in stores and learnt to read it (ie reading right to left), but I'm also aware this could be confusing and don't want to be disruptive to his development and education. I just want to give him choice of media, and since they live in a region closer to the east than I am, they may consider visiting Japan > US (who wouldn't at this time?!) 

I've sent money for a few standard picture books like The Tiger Who Came To Tea and The Very Hungry Caterpillar, but if there's anything my sister and husband could read to him and show him, I'd really appreciate it. But if there's a more basic manga that may aid his literary skills, or if he's too early for that, I'd appreciate the advice. It's just a thought. My brothers family have been able to visit them more than we have because they have money to burn and we don't, and are also closer geographically, so I'd like to be able to introduce him to different ways of understanding without overwhelming him. Does this make sense? I hope it does.",False,manga,1705883932.0,19cioof

Looking for a isekai manga,"I think it was the standard format of a guy inheriting his grandmother's (or someone elses) old house and finding a portal that leads him to another world.

In this new world he appears in a cabin that is right in the middle of an extremely dangerous forest (like S ranked monsters roaming around) but the house happens to have some sort of barrier around it making the monsters stay away.

He somehow becomes extremely op. I don't remember how but it was very quickly so I think it was more like a inheritance than actual training.

He finds some sort of princess/important girl in danger out in the woods and rescues her. She goes back to her city. I think something happens, she suggests getting the help of that op guy she met in the forest (mc) so she goes back to find him again.

I also remember later on some assassin type girl goes after mc since she's heard from the nobles that they have some op hidden card in the forest but instead mc ends up saving her from monsters and they start to develop an amicable relationship (he doesn't know she's an assassin). It ends with her not having the courage to kill him since he was so kind to her so she just leaves without saying anything.

All I remember from the general story is basically just the mc staying in the forest and the female lead going back and forth between the forest and the city. I don't remember any significant event except for the assassin thing but I'm not sure if this is due to it having a low amount of chapters or if the story stuff just wasn't very good",False,manga,1705881968.0,19chzpl

The reason for this thread's existence is the fact that both requests and suggestions became kind of stale. It's supposed to bring out more manga that is not RTed or recommended. Also, it's quite useful for the discussion of not so current titles.

Previous weeks: [First 72 weeks](http://www.reddit.com/r/manga/search?q=author%3Agladiatorua+What+manga+have+you+read+this+week%2C+and+what+do+you+think+about+it%3F&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all#page=1) and from [June 28, 2015 onwards](http://www.reddit.com/r/manga/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+What+manga+have+you+read+this+week%2C+and+what+do+you+think+about+it%3F&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).

Also, not a rule or any kind of criticism, the more interesting part is not the list of the stuff you read, but your impressions of it.

So in order to keep her and not him they decided to kill him off, while she was off fighting in the dongen they pushed him into a trap for him to die.

Best science fiction and fantasy manga that have good/positive representations of women/girls.,"
Basically I’m looking for science fiction and fantasy manga that:

•Avoids the Stay in the kitchen trope: where women are expected to sit on the sidelines and let the men do all of the work.

•Avoids the [Faux Action girl trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl): where the women’s intelligent, skills, and strengths are just informed attributes. And she’s only included to try and make the work look more progressive than it actually is.

•Avoid or subvert the [Defied Forever trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever).

•Any achievements they have made have to be based on their skills and merits, not based on their looks or who they slept with.

•Avoids being a wet blanket or a soapbox Sadie.

•Avoid or subvert the [Men act, Women are trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenActWomenAre)

•Avoid The [Vasquez always dies trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VasquezAlwaysDies)

•Give them greater ambitions than just being the love interest and getting married to a man or getting laid with one.

•However, for those that insist on ending the story with the female characters retiring from “heroing” or whatever they were doing before to become housewives or Yamato Nadeshikos at the very least avoid depicting them as pushovers and getting into marriage that have some unfortunate implications (Ex: large age gap, marrying someone that has misogynistic tendencies or has sexual harassed or assaulted them).

O capitulo final ele saem em um encontro no aquario, nesse encontro eles depois de um tempo dão as mãos e andam juntos, após o passeio terminar eles vão para o estacionamento ou uma parte fora do aquário, la o garoto fala pra ela que tem algo para dar a ela, ele se aproxima e da um beijo nela, depois do beijo a garota fica muito emvergonhada e pede a ele para beija-la novamente, FIM.

I don't remember it fully but:The MC is sent to a mandatory school/academy for training and survival. While there everyone gets their class appraised and the MC ends up with a type of production job; due to him receiving this job the rest of his class kicks him out to live/survive on his own. The MC is mostly oblivious to how rude how his class is treating them and constantly tries to help whenever.

Later on in the series he stumbles upon another class' student who turns out to have the \[Miko} class and is having difficulty hunting with the bow provided to her. The MC takes it upon himself to create an Eastern-style bow (one that she said she was more used to) and arrows to help her out. She \[Miko} asks to become a disciple under him for training, and he somewhat agrees as long as she \[Miko\] becomes friends with the girl \[Saintess\] in his class.

Key points: 
- mc is male and there’s little to no romance
- it should be a full colour webtoon/manhwa (Korean)
- the setting was olden european (church/religious) but there was also martial arts (mc’s master taught him a form of fighting that I think was martial arts)
- world building had monsters that humans were generally subjugating/fighting
- the church had a good and a secret evil faction, with everyone trying to figure out who’s in the evil faction 
- there were relics that the church used to defeat the monsters/power up
- at some point the next in line religious leader was betrayed by someone he trusted (he had a really big pillar close to him when he got betrayed, setting wise)

What's that yaoi manga??,"Alright, so I many years ago I would frequent deviantart and there were panels of a comic that would pop up that led me a the website of a manga webcomic. It was a while ago so hard to remember the exact premise but I believe that it was about sex workers, and there was one very innocent and shy boy with pink curly hair, a taller more muscular outgoing guy with tattoos and i think like a sort of down mohawk that was red (possibly electric blue but i think red), there were also women too. It was like a prostitute house i believe.

I recall the pink curly hair boy had a lot of childhood flashbacks. It was all very old-timey and fancy, dresses wirh ruffles and ruffled collars and vests.. but not strictly. There was a patron who frequently ordered the pink hair boy who was a tall quiet man with long straight black hair, and the curly hair boy was always super shy around him.. i remember once he brought quiche as a gift to the tall black haired guy and it was awkward.

There is plenty of sex and nudity in it as well. Its a very beautifully drawn comic, with leave shadows, courtyards, all in like a big mansion.. 

So any ideas?? This was back in like 2010s.. something like that. Maybe earlier.

The reason i am looking is I am reading a book called Kusheil's Dart and the imagery makes me think of that comic.",False,manga,1705794361.0,19bpi1s

Looking for a vigilante manga I read a long time ago,"Hello, figured I might as well ask here since I've spent the last couple hours searching to no avail.  


I initially found this manga in the comment section of a thread that was discussing disturbing manga such as the one featuring Junko Furuta's story and such other things.  


Now onto the manga I'm trying to remember, it featured two male main characters who ran a shop somewhere in 90s Japan that carried out Vigilante services for customers that could not go to the police to get revenge for example rape victims or homicide cases etc, most of the targets would usually end up with major injuries or straight up having their corpses displayed in public with body parts missing. I remember one of the main characters being an older male and it was assumed that he was a retired Yakuza member as he had no tolerance for criminals and would torture and kill them without batting an eyelid, while the other main character was a young adult who was unaware that his partner was torturing the targets.

Please help me,"So, I have searched for this manga I read sometime back and I need help finding it. So it starts out with this girl(MC) living in a slum city and in an apocalyptic world. The rules in the city is that if you commit a crime, you get the death penalty, and this one specific dude (I will call enforcer) that's basically the strongest will kill you. It's aggressive with the rules too, like there was a little girl that stole a teddy bear for her little brother, and she got killed. The story goes that the MC is strong and good at boxing(eventually unlocks fire power), so she lets anyone beat her up on the street for money. One day a rich government official beats her up then starts sexually assaulting her, so she fights back, but that's illegal, so she's on the run. Eventually she gets saved by a small group of revolutionaries, and starts working for them. The whole thing about the revolutionaries is that they want to change the government, but not kill anybody, big peaceful takeover ideology. The leader is a kid that can control people, there is a small scientist in a robot, a fat swordsman, and a humanoid fox that was part of the church, and uses guns that look like a cross. That's the general overview, but the art for the series is pretty distinct from what I remember. It's mostly black and white, but there are colors added to represent different peoples powers, and ideals. So the main characters fire power, and the ideology of the revolution is blue, the enforcer is wavy dark red, and that's all I remember. Don't take this last part as seriously, but for some reason, I remember the title has to do with the MC power or name, like blast or blazing(idk).  ",False,manga,1705790278.0,19bnz47

Help me find a manga with lock and key motifs,"Hi! So, approximately 10 years ago around 2012-2014 I read the two first volumes of a manga that I can not find for the life of me. I do not remember the title or names of any characters. Based on the intricate art style it looked to have been made anywhere between 2000-2010, and I had bought them secondhand. I read it in Finnish so it was might have been translated into other languages as well. It did not seem like a huge title and I'm not aware if it had an anime adaptation or not.

It was a fantasy manga that centered around two teenage sisters, one whose powers could open locks (locks between worlds or something like that) and the other could close them. The sisters based on my memory were sheltered orphans, and the story begins with one of them being kidnapped by some sort of antagonist, while the other tries to find/save her. I think the cover art had brownish colors and featured the lock / key motifs as well as one of the sisters.

I know this is all really vague and some details could be wrong, but this is my last resort. I've tried looking up manga on Finnish websites, browsed through a bunch of secondhand bookstores and searched online with no luck. When I search ''manga lock and key'' or something like that it just brings up the show Locke & Key.

I never got to finish the manga and am looking to reread it, as I remember loving the premise back then. Any help is appreciated!

What's the best way to enjoy manga without access to the physical medium?,"I'm rather new to manga in general. I began reading manga a bit over 2 months ago and so far I've read *Fumikiri Jikan*, *Gakkougurashi!*, *Angel Beats: Heaven's Doors* and *Joshikausei*. Finding these mangas was relatively easy because a couple of them were available on Crunchyroll before they closed their manga section, and they're not too niche or rare as to not be able to find them.

Recently, I bought physical manga for the first time: *Sekai no Owari to Yoakemae*, the first volume of *Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso* and the boxset for *Another*. I've been having a blast reading these mangas in physical format, it feels authentic and immersive.

However, I've quickly run into a bit of an issue, you see, I'm limited to buying manga from local licensed editorials which localize them and distribute them in my country. Buying manga in English or any other language for that matter is not really possible due to the incredible cost of doing so. Imagine that buying only the first volume of *Nichijou* in English would cost me some $50 USD, and that's not including taxes + shipping, and consider that the average wage where I live is roughly $300 USD. Even mangas that are licensed and distributed here end up being relatively expensive (albeit much cheaper than importing anything), the catalogs are very limited, and they run out of stock really fast. (the *Suzumiya Haruhi* Series have been out of stock for years, for instance).

As I said previously, I've read most manga online, but the experience is mediocre at best. Most of the time it implies visiting some ad-filled websites, they might be missing chapters, and the quality of the scans might be rather terrible. This is also implying I can even find the manga I'm looking for; I enjoy some niche stuff, such as *Angel Beats! The 4-koma: Bokura no Sensen Koushinkyoku♪*, but this is a manga that only has a few chapters scanned.

The question is practically the one in the title: what's the best way for me to enjoy manga, considering I have considerably limited access to the physical medium? Is just reading scans by fans off crappy websites with missing chapters the only way? Or is there perhaps something more preferable I've been missing?",False,manga,1705748476.0,19b9dp9

Can’t remember name of Manga/Manwha.,"So I watch a lot of recap videos on YouTube and recently  I remembered one of my favorites that should have gotten an update by now but I couldn’t find the name saved anyway or find it in my months of recent YouTube history (or all history by keyword searches) From what I remember, it is similar to solo leveling in that it has hunters and guilds in the modern era. The MC is male and due to ranking is expected to be weak by everyone but turns out to be OP. In the early chapters one guild (with a female leader) grows suspicious and starts stalking and researching him to figure out if he is hiding something. There is also another “famous” guild that has some cocky guy who is attacking/threatening his sister to which he shows up in time to save. When he gets there his sister is worried but he beats up the famous and supposedly OP Hunter rather easily to everyone’s (including his sister’s) surprise. I’ve been going through gate like manga/manwhas on anime list but can’t find it.",False,manga,1705725984.0,19b3n7c

Looking for another manga (srry for bothering),"So, something happened to my chrome data an lost a lot some of the mangas I was reading, this is the only one I haven't been able to recover yet. 

So it's the classic ""I reincarnated as the Villainess of a dating sim"" but in this one she's discovered as a reincarnated by the Villainess brother, also, in the story the Villainess became one after loosing her parents to a monster stampede caused by an undiscovered dungeon. 

Also, the protagonist is into a wolf demi human of the dating sim and if I'm not wrong is interested in cocktails.

Could you help me find it?",False,manga,1705723907.0,19b30wc

Looking for Manga I forgotten,"Hello, I'm trying to remember the title of a peticular Villainess manga but I just can't seem to find it.

The story goes that this Mc gets reincarnated as a villainess but the main twist I'd that the otome game story has her character get killed in a whole bunch of was ranging from a fire ball to the face, her sister, even high cholesterol. Her in game stats are also pretty weak and the only attack she is supposed to specialize in is the Boston Crab wrestling move.

And just like most Villainess Otome manga she unintentionally attracts the capture targets like her ex fiance who had a grudge on commoners (because his elder sister ran away to get married to one) and a competitive crown prince.

She also befriends the crown prince's sister who is kind of cursed to decay anything near her.

That is just about all I remember but hopefully it is enough to find the manga.",False,manga,1705723714.0,19b2yo9

A manga about a shy and anxious girl working at a cafe,"Please help me find this manga. I thought I had this saved but sadly I don't. The manga is about a high school girl who is very anxious and shy. She has a stutter. Her hair is short, around her ears. He has a very hard time speaking at school, and sometimes is made fun of. Other students are more sympathetic.

She decides to be brave and gets a job at a cafe where she will have to talk to customers. The cafe is owned by an older man who is thin. It is not a new manga, either in art style or content--I'm 99% sure I've never seen a cell phone and a lot of customers smoke inside.

One of the storylines is about her helping a girl who was raped or about to be, and later the same girl setting her up to be raped. (She escapes.)

Once, she also gets the courage to hang with some customers and gets drunk. When she does, she can speak without her stutter.

Another storyline is when she helps a college student customer and his friends in painting the side of a building so it looks like it blends with the sky.

She is being pursued by two customers, one who goes to school with her.

I’ll try to recall as much as I can remember 

So as a child MC was on his way to his friends house and saw said friend on the balcony and I think called out to him? Friend sees mc and leans over the balcony waving and ends up falling off and hurting themselves really bad. (It’s presumed that they died I think) 
There’s a time skip to when MC is older(college age?) and it seems as thought the friend survived as they are still hanging out together but when another  guy starts to take interest in MC, Said Guy tells mc later on in their relationship something along the lines of “there is no one there” meaning that friend is either dead or not around and mc has been imagining their friend the entire time 

I remember the friend having pinkish/red hair

And the first chapter had pinkish/red friend sitting/leaning on a balcony threatening MC saying that they would jump.

If this sound familiar pls say the title!
If you need more context let me know, I wanna find this one!

Edit!: I remembered something else!
Turns out the friends parents didn’t let mc see them after their bad accident as a child. The friend is alive! Just living his own life without mc

I’m looking for something with a similar setting to Kara no Kyokai (Garden of Sinners), as while I’ve only seen the first movie, I was hooked to the overall setting of a hidden magical community unknown to the rest of the populace. I also admire the light novel Vampire Hunter D, as the setting of fantasy and sci fi, vampires, and the main character, D, got me wanting for more. I also read and really enjoyed Tokyo Ghoul, both for the plot and the way how the titular ghouls function in a modern setting.

After some time, they try to hunt, but a tiger or something makes them split up and she is saved by a boy, who takes her in.

Jujutsu Kaisen: Toji Comeback?," I was thinking a lot why Gojo was wearing Toji outfit while fighting Sukuna. I have seen some theories and they made sense. But then I just thought about something. I know its dumb and it will NEVER happen but I'm saying what if. You know how Toji sneaked into Megumi's domain and then killed Dagon. What if Shoko and Yuta finds a way to revive Gojo (they make an binding vow or something idk) and they revive Gojo. But somehow Toji's soul sneaks in and instead of Gojo, Toji will be revived. And I thought maybe he will learn that Sukuna killed Megumi inside him and he will attack Sukuna for revenge of his son. And he will deal a good damage and save Megumi (then he dies again).

Elusive title search - please help,"I'm searching for the name of a manga series I started reading a few years ago. I've spent hours on various websites filtering tags, I've tried describing it to Ai - all to no avail.

The clues are as follows:

* Young (late teens?) male protagonist learning the ropes & how to fend for himself
* Fantasy setting - some island/continent where humans are trying to colonise
* Samurai/historical tech level - protagonist uses spears, swords, bows, wooden shields
* Orcs, other monsters live on island/continent & skirmish/war against the humans
* Realistic feel: survival is tough, in depth analysis of what weapons & tactics to use, there's blood, gore & nudity, characters & situations are ""grey"" & not melodramatic

What it is not:

* Isikai - protagonist grew up in world & sought out the adventure
* High fantasy (ie. no magic & wizards as far as I read)
* Manhau, manhwa, webcomic, etc.

Specific scenes I can recall:

* Upon arriving at the main port/fort the young protagonist must fight a captive goblin/creature. He learns valuable lessons when he manages to make his first kill & is respectful to his fallen ""teacher""
* In one of the skirmishes the protagonist is running with a group of soldiers/adventurers to some battle/event when he leaves the group to investigate something in the forest. It was an enemy orc with a massive sword. Instead of fighting he shares food because the orc had a young human with him the orc was caring for
* There was an antagonist called ""White Mask"" or ""White Death""? He was a faun/creature that moved very quickly and hounded forts & human groups
* Early on there was an introductory expedition to show the newbies how dangerous the island/continent was, how to keep quiet and travel so-as to increase their chances of survival
* The orcs kept humans as slaves & one of the top human fighters (a young woman who fought naked?) reality checked some girls recently caught that they needed to accept their new plight else the orcs dispose of them

I bought the Innocent omnibus just to support the author in hopes of getting the climber in English and now I can't wait for Innocent vol 2,"To be honest I am not sure if I should recommend Innocent to everyone (I probably shouldn't) but this manga is something else. It's supremely fucked in a very realistic way, very dramatic, very unsettling, and it's the first manga I've read in a long time that I catch myself thinking about regularly. (It's a historical manga about the man who invented the guillotine)

I initially bought innocent just to support the author in hopes that his other series, ""the climber"" would get published in English, as dark horse stated that their interest in licensing that series depended on the sales of innocent. 
Side note 1: I know the climber is available online in certain places but I personally refuse to read manga on a screen. I'm happy to pay for a physical release.
Side note 2: I'm 30 and rock climb myself frequently and read manga even more frequently so it's no surprise that I want legit releases of the series, in addition vagabond is one of my favorite series of all time and the comparison between the climber and vagabond is something I've seen often.

So I picked up innocent and I'm somewhat blown away. The series is a masterpiece (based on reading omnibus vol 1 only). It's very different from anything I've read before. It's extremely dramatic, disturbing, and gorgeous all at the same time. Even in the most serious seinin manga I've read, there are at least moments of light-heartedness and humor (berserk, vagabond, Vinland saga), but in innocent, there are none. If there is a slight moment of hope or joy, it's only to make the next scene or arc that much more intense and depressing. The art is super detailed but isn't very reminiscent of traditional manga, it's kind of a hybrid of manga and 90's underground adult Western comics. I read a fair amount of horror manga and innocent has disturbed me more than any horror manga I've read. But, regardless, I'm hooked and absolutely can't wait for vol 2 in April.

Idk why I made this post, but I guess it's to encourage you to buy and try out innocent if this sounds like it might be your thing. I love it, I can see a lot of others also loving it (but certainly not all), and any purchase of it would increase the chances of the climber being published.

Question about Dungeon Meshi,"Does it ever get back to being a manga about cooking monsters?

Don’t get me wrong I’m enjoying it but as I get further in it feels like the story is getting further and further from what was presented as it’s base concept. Like initially it felt like them eating monsters was this main point and I was kind of expecting this story about learning to survive and live off the land but with monsters in a dungeon. But now it feels like the cooking and eating the monsters is just a gimmick on top of a solidly done fantasy story. Like from where I currently am mid way through it seems like you could completely remove them cooking monsters and it really wouldn’t harm the story. it doesn’t even seem to do much with the cooking concept at this point as most of it is just them pausing to describe what dish they made from what they recently killed but the cooking doesn’t really add anything to what’s going on. It just feels kind of like a bait and switch where it advertised weird cooking shenanigans and instead it’s a well done fantasy story. Which again not really complaining much because I am enjoying the fantasy story it just seems odd that the cooking aspect feels so superficial and I’m wondering if it ever becomes more of a main point again or if I should just continue forward expecting a fantasy story with monster cooking as a side gimmick.",False,manga,1705619885.0,19a41e8

She's a bit cocky and I'm surprised she even has the guts to be strict and cold towards her boss. How is that even possible? She's kinda taking advantage of the fact that Konishikawa doesn't scold her. It would be cool if he goes back to his old self cause rn he just feels bland and like a pushover. I understand him being too soft now due to what happened in the past but he really needs to act like a boss. I'm trying to say that he should be overly strict but he should be strict cause Misaki really needs to be scolded. She herself knows that she cannot be taking to Konishikawa the way she talks to him but she still does it. This is what I think so far. Let me know your thoughts",False,manga,1705610284.0,19a05b3

My Biggest Problem with Hunter x Hunter,"By far the most annoying thing about HxH to me is that Togashi ends nearly every arc anti-climactically. It’s like perpetual blue balls. There are some arcs where this doesn’t really bother me that much (Yorknew and Election arc) but the vast majority end in a way that just kinda makes me roll my eyes and ask why?? Like it’s great buildup and has me hooked on the plot but then just ends lackluster. And I never really see people talking about this aspect of it so I’m wondering if anybody else has noticed it or has it just not bothered y’all like it does me.

I’ll briefly go thru the arcs and anti-climax’s 

Hunter Exam: Great buildup but then ends with Gon getting a concussion and all the final matches are all skipped over.

Zoldyck Family: They’re tryna rescue Killua from his family. They build up Killua’s family like it’s gonna be an epic showdown but it ends with Killua’s family just letting him go.

Heaven Arena: An epic battle tower buildup but after Gon loses to Hisoka they just leave.

Yorknew: Great story and builds tension masterfully with the Phantom Troupe and Gon’s crew. But just ends in a prisoner swap. (Again I didn’t mind this one)

Greed Island: To me the only arc that doesn’t end on an anti-climax. But imo easily the most boring arc

Chimera Ant: Great build up with the ants and Meruem. But after Meruem survives his fight with Netero and absorbs his Royal guards becoming even stronger, he just dies due to poison.

Election Arc: Gon set out on this whole journey to meet his dad but when he finally meets him after all this time he’s just kinda a douche. (Again I didn’t mind this one cus it’s kinda real lol all dad’s aren’t amazing heroes)

Is Forbidden Planet's (UK) Subscription Service the best kept secret in Manga?,"I've been buying manga from Forbidden Planet for nearly 20 years but it's not always easy to get to a physical shop.

It was pretty threadbare tbh, and they only had 5 of the manga's I was reading but I decided to give it a try and subscribed. Sure, you dont get the manga on the day it is released (it's usually around the end of the month) but I've not had any problems with them. 

Anyway, I checked the subscription page again yesterday and they have SIGNIFICANTLY expanded their selection so that now you can sign up to receive pretty much any manga you can think of (it also includes light novels). 

So I'm now subscribed to 14 of the 18 series I'm reading (plus two new subscriptions/pre-orders for Initial D and Smoking Behind the Supermarket With You) and it has taken all of the worry and hard work out of trying to keep up with the latest volumes across so many series.

Forgotten classics or just a US market that has moved on?,"A lot of us who came into fandom in the 80s didn't exactly have a ton of variety to choose from in our manga and anime. The availability just wasn't there. 

Now when I look at the shelves at B&N and even at collection posts, I don't see a lot of representation of those early properties. It makes me wonder if those are truly forgotten classics or just the manga and anime version of Stockholm Syndrome. I know much of it was still quality stuff, but I'm struggling with seeing the market move on from what used to be perennial titles. Of course Akira stayed relevant, Dragon Ball and Sailor Moon hung around, Takahashi's stuff has stayed in print, and it seems like Lupin III and Fist of the North Star have not been fully forgotten. But is there any modern love for 80s and 90s stuff like...

need help finding 2000-2013 shojosei romance manga about girl crossdressing in theatre troupe with snake curse,"This is an older manga. Ik not like pre 2000s but sometime before 2013 latest probably post 2005 tho

It starts off with this girl in like a traveling theatre troupe or something and she's dressed as a guy (pretty sure cause only guys can be part of the troupe). She cross dresses and I remember one chapter she gets drunk and faints and the male lead brings her back to his tent abode thingy and (almost?) discovers she's a girl and is like she smells suuper good in the same chapter too. I think he almost kisses her while she's sleeping too but idr exact 

There's a plot point in the manga where the girl slowly grows scales over her body. I think it was some like hereditary curse or something?

I'm pretty sure it was a pretty short manga or the scanlators didn't TL many of the chapters

Problems with Physical and Digital Manga.,"I have a small problem with physical and digital manga. On one hand, I really like physical manga, its really nice to read and hold a physical book and read a good story without being on the computer. The feeling of having a solid, tangible book to read is simply great, however, its bulky, fragile, and expensive, especially with omnibus's. On the other hand, digital manga is much easier to obtain and duplicate, not to mention being incredible portable and dense. The only problem is that A: Digital manga does my head in for some reason, I can still read it, but its alot harder than reading a physical book, and I have no clue why, and, B: Reading something on a computer just doesn't feel as good. I don't know if there are any formats that could help me find a balance between the two, so if anyone knows of any that would be appreciated, it would be nice to have the tactile feel of reading a book mixed with the portability and convenience of having a computer with 100's if not 1000's of manga on it.",False,manga,1705572143.0,199mqf5

Help Me Remember the Title of a Manga,"Hello,

&#x200B;

A few years ago (2018/2019) I was reading a manga and caught up to what was current at the time. I cannot remember the title and I read it on an obscure site which I can't find anymore as well.

&#x200B;

From my memory, I know it was an Action/Comedy series with both magic and sci-fi. I can't remember if the MC was isekied or not but he was stronger than almost everyone.

I recall that there were sanctuary cities. Like the world had gone through an apocolyce and the few cities had shields that kept the population safe. Not too long after the start the MC had to flee his town with his ""mercenary band""? out of the town because he was getting too much attention, I think.

One of the MC's gotos, when a fight was getting tense, was to create a magical flashbang and run away, always for comedic effect.

&#x200B;

I have no idea why I remember the word ""King"" regarding this manga. It could have been in the title or maybe the name of the site I read it on at that time.

edit: i can Kinda remember it was similar to junji had that grungy vibe to it to really emphasize the psychological horror but cant confirm obviously
edit 2: can remember about more what happened clearly, only reason the kid found his mok in the shed was cause he was going back to chasing this same girl who was presumably a class mate and they stumble across weird noises coming from it, and im pretty sure the kids punishment was wither being spanked or being belted if that rings any more bells, and the kids being around 10 ish while the mom 30s maybe and it was quite anort probably 15 pages at most not a big longest series or book",True,manga,1705546605.0,199fpsl

I need help finding a romance time traveling manga,"
I read this manga like two years ago, it seems to be a bit obscure considering I couldn't find it after like 3 hours of searching. It's about a guy from the future returning or going to the past as a middle/high schooler to stop a girl from shattering the universe. She isn't aware of her connecting to shattering time, and I recall it occurring when her emotions are intense. He has a limited number of times to reverse, and I distinctly remember the manga having a counter whenever he reversed time. I remember some details, such as another character, I think her sister, being aware that she can shatter the universe, and another character from the future and same organization as him telling him that he shouldn't stay in that time because he loves her.

Like there is a scientist that is fat and bald that helps Astro and that the father of Astro is trying to destroy him. So, are they all in the manga?

Re-Discovering a Manga,"Obligatory sorry if this doesn’t fit with the rules bc idk where else to post this. So I read this manga when I was in middle school roughly, so it’s been several years and I don’t remember everything properly. Ok, so it’s this high school boy who is constantly bugged by this girl who I think is a sort of demon. I think they’re a race of demons that grant 3(?) wishes, then take your soul. This boy doesn’t really want anything and tells her to not waste her time, but she’s stubborn and still hangs around him to get him to use wishes, but ofc they get close and actually become friends (and love interests). Lo and behold, ANOTHER GIRL shows up also trying to get him to use his 3 wishes, so the girls become competitive to get his soul (and eventually, it develops into who wins his heart since the other girl also falls in love with him). 


For extra specifics to find this, turns out that this is the boy’s second chance at life (AKA reincarnated) and had met girl #2 in his previous life, when he was chronically ill as a child. When they initially met, she once again was trying to make him use his 3 wishes and became friends when he didn’t and she hung around. When he’s on his deathbed, she begs him to use one of his wishes to get better, but he WANTS to die so he could be with his parents that had died before he was hospitalized. When he eventually passes away, she uses the wish(es) for him to reincarnate and have a fulfilling life.",False,manga,1705535152.0,199bl6v

"Unusual, unsettling, deep and aesthetic manga","I've been after mangas for a while and have gone over most genres, going though diffrent phases but still enjoying all of them nonethelss.

All of them have an english translation. There's many missing, and I've already checked all of the autors' other works. Thank you very much.

Looking for some manga recommendations! (+18 Warning),"Hi there! Hope everyone is good.  


I am struggling to find a good manga to read (because I am bit picky).  
Before starting, every thing said in this post is based in my opinion so please respect it.   


By example, I loved Eminence of Shadow anime but I would have not read its manga since I would have found it very boring, but the anime was great, I think the same for Frieren by example.  
I also loved Spice and Wolf and I'd like to find another good manga similar to it, I liked how flirty they were and so.  
To add I like pretty much isekais or fantasy stuffs but I'd like them to have romance.

Recently I have read **Watashi ga 15-sai de wa Nakunatte mo**  and well I found it very interesting (Because is something like ""new"" and no cliche as most stuffs). I have also read Komodo No Jikan.\]  
Oshi no Ko is great too, Solo leveling was good but most of the similar ones are very bad.  


Her majesty's swarm has a very good concept as well, I liked the idea of it but the manga was not very good tbh.  


  
Soooo I am looking for something similar to those I have mentioned, I mean not really similar but good, I am not very sure how to explain it but please feel free to ask something.

Both the female lead and male lead are a bit airheaded. If I remember correctly, when they confessed, they misunderstood each other lol. and also the woman dyed her hair, but when their mom visited, she dyed it black again.

I believe the female lead has a purplish/bluish jacket that mostly hangs on her rather than fully wearing it, a cardigan, and hair I'd best describe as trad otome game villainess.

Looking for an old manga or manhwa,"I'm looking for a manga or manhwa that I read quite a while ago, I think somewhen in the 2010s. I don't remember much about it, but I think it's episodic in nature, or at the very least have one self-contained chapter. The plot of this chapter is like this:

1. It took place in either a concentration camp or a prison.
2. Everyday, at the exact same time, a stoic guard would sound the trumpet (or other musical instrument), and some prisoners would be executed.
3. A child tried to befriend the guard, but the guard showed no sign of caring.
4. One day, it was set that either the child or someone close to him/her will be executed the next morning. The child came begging the guard not to sound the trumpet the next day, because he thinks the trumpet is the reason people dies.
5. The guard remains emotionless, but the next morning, instead of sounding the signal like usual, he played a song with his trumpet. This cause confusion among the prison/camp staff, and the execution was delayed till the next day.
6. The guard is then taken away for insubordination. Not much is clear about what happened after, but I remember the man remain stoic to the very end.

And this might be me mixing it up with another manga here, but if my hazy memory serve me right, I think this story is nested within a framing story. The trumpet was bring to a shop of some kind, and the story about the trumpet is told in that shop.

Dead Mount Death Play is not talked enough and it hurts,"Kinda hard to fangirl and nerd over a series when it's not talked about 😡 

But please, we should talk about DMDP and how much mystery we have yet to discover, not only during the present arc, but also, about the main character's old life. >!His friendship with the emperor, the sorcerers, and even the world building.  !<  


I added the hot, crazy oneechan in the end to lure in some peeps to read the series.

Help finding manga / manwha,"I don't have a lot to go on but here goes. It starts out in either a game world or a killing game. They accumulate money or points and eventually there is a twist. They end up in what looks like a shopping mall. The main character can access items and places to become stronger, pretty sure locked behind  currency or something of the sort.

It's not solo levelling, omniscient reader, the beginning before the end.
