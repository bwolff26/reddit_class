I hope I'm not being too specific, but I just want to see a loving FL that patiently waits while the ML finally accepts her advances and eventually shows her an unexpectedly cute loving side.

"Trying to find a horror/action manga, probably 90s/80s",,"I read it sometime around 2013, but the art looked older. I'm thinking around early 90s late 80s since I remember the general style (especially the eyes) was a bit like Parasyte but not as refined. 

The main plot revolved around groups of people (clans I think?) who could summon creatures to fight for them. The main character was from the dragon clan and summoned a very godzilla-looking dragon. There was a tech themed group that summoned robots, and one survivor of the ""woman clan"" who summoned a succubus looking thing. 

The way the monsters all spawned depended on the clan and is the most distinctive detail. These things (drones or creatures idk) would fly out and pry open the characters body where the monster was supposed to come from. Dragon clan was stomach, tech people from the head, and the last one came from the ""chest"". This part wasn't gorey, for the MC it just lifted up his shirt, but the battles got bloody.

The monsters were linked with who spawned them and if they got hurt so did the summoner. The woman also dies in a self sacrifice at one point and her last scene is her unable to light a cigarette drenched in blood.",False,manga,1705988166.0,19dh6b7

"Question about ""More than a married couple, but not lovers""",,"I love romances and watching characters get closer. I have been thinking about starting this but have been holding off because it seems like just a setup for drama without a lot of substance.

Do the characters spend a lot of time vacillating between their assigned partner and the one they love? Do they just become really close friends with their assigned partner or is it more?",False,manga,1705967526.0,19dadgj

Searching for a manga for 5 years now,,"Hello guys, I really don’t know what to do else but I am actually searching for a manga I’ve read in 2017. 

I only remember the main plot and some details but not even ChatGPT is able to find the right manga. I would recognise is directly from the cover.

It is a short Manga-Series, I think about 3 to 5 volumes. And the covers have a specific monochrome Color like grey, blue and green and black, remember.
All of them are somehow pastellish and show the female or male protagonist in a beautiful artwork but it’s like minimalistic.

The general plot:

It’s about two people a boy and a girl who have to kill a schoolmate of theirs by stabbing him in the hand with a hair pin as the schoolmate is holding on the body I think of the girl or boy idr while they: the schoolmate and one of them, girl or boy, are holding onto the roof their high school.

So intentionally, the plot is about the schoolmate dying because of them.

But there is more to it.
The schoolmate is the boyfriend or exboyfriend of the girl and the boy is the childhood friend of some sort.

So, I will refer to the schoolmate who died as the boyfriend and the other who is the male protagonist as just boy so there is clearance.

The girl is somehow in a relationship with the schoolmate/boyfriend/exboyfriend at beginning, obviously and then the boyfriend gets somehow jealous. Something happens that he gets very angry.

If I remember it right, it has something to do with the male protagonist and the girl having interaction but I am not sure on that boy.

Anyways, they somehow are on the roof and fight. 

The boyfriend/exboyfriend hates the male protagonist because he would look good.

I remember reading a sequence where he was talking about his mother saying that he is ugly and forcing him to have plastic surgery to look good which is why he is admired by the student in his school after.

But still he is hating the male protagonist because he would be a natural beauty.

But I am not to sure about that. It could be also because of some other thing the male protagonist has and the exboyfriend didn’t have in the past and for which he was treated badly by his mother.
 
The exboyfriend then tries to push him off the roof or something Idr.
Something happens which ends up in the girl or the boy, hanging from the roof whilst the boyfriend is holding onto to the body.

A hair pin which was a present from the boyfriend to the girl is used to stab in the hand of the boyfriend who wants to take the person who he is holding onto with him to death.

After his hand is stabbed he fells and gets killed on school ground.

The murder weapon, the hair pin is searched for.

———-

The main plot is hiding this hair pin and evidence and covering up the act by the boy, the male protagonist and the girl, the female protagonist.

In that process they develop feelings for each other if I remember it right.

Ultimately everything is covered and they try to flee by taking the train.
As they try to enter the train, the boy pushes the girl into the train and lets himself get cought.

There is a time lapse at the end of the last mange where the girl goes back to her hometown and meets the boy in a caffe.

I somehow also remember the caffe having a train-theme or something like that but the important information is that they meet in a caffe after a long time since the incident.


This is everything I remember and it is only what I remember. It is very likely that there are some mistakes and everything but I would be so so so happy, if someone could help because I really just want to read this manga again, I am literally desperate :((:////",False,manga,1705961023.0,19d7sqo

Weird Manga I Can't Remember,,"So...there is this very specific Manga I ran across about a year ago. It was about a group of 3 or so friends(all dudes) who lived like...100 or 200 years prior. When the story takes off, they've all been reincarnated into the modern day with their original memories. The MC is still a dude, but one of his best guy friends was reborn as a chick, and I think the other just pretends not to remember the first two.

I actually got mixed up the two manga and create a plot in my own mind, LOL. Yuusha Party wo Tsuihou Sareta Ore da ga, Ore kara Sudatte Kureta you de Ureshii. Nanode Daiseijo, Omae ni Otte Korarete wa Komaru no da ga is the Mana storage plot.   


Point Gifter Keikenchi Bunpai Nouryokusha no Isekai Saikyou Solo Life is the manga where MC share the exp. Where my mind somehow remember it was mana, In fact it was not. 

Question: Can someone help me with the name of this manga. I cant remember the name of this manga, Basically the MC have the power to share/pool the mana to anyone in his party/guild. After he get kicked out of the party/guild. Everyone fire power suddenly decrease. But the party is in denial. Even there is doubt. When MC left the party they suddenly not as powerful as before.  Also they kind of jerk to each other, If i recall the leader just left their sorcecer to get beaten to safe their own self.

i need help finding this manga,,"It's a manga about a cat (probably orange, I don't remember)that can secretly talk and it's owner runs a cafe/restaurant (the owner also wears GLASSES!!!)
I'll tell a bit more detail with one of their stories : 

    While the cat was walking around, she founds a strange girl that turns out to be a vengeful ghost because her ex cheated on him (I don't remember)and the girl forces the cat to help find a key to her apartment so she can see her ex.

    After some case solving (and some funny comedy), turns out the key is near the place where she died and when she visited her ex (she's still dead) the ex apologized.

   When both the cat and the girl sit outside the restaurant that the cat owner owns, the owner walks out and sees the girl and invites her to his restaurant to eat (turns out he can see ghosts? His partner couldn't lol)

    After she came in the restaurant, the owner decided to recommend a special table(in which she did sit in)

   Middle in the cooking, the ghost girl looks out of the window and sees the beautiful Sakura trees and asks if she can reserve the table for next year(idk I forgot) the owner agrees only to be confused when the girl suddenly disappeared.

   It then cuts to somewhere in the hospital, where it turns out the girl has been revived and she askes her mother of they could go to the same restaurant earlier to reserve a table.

And no, that's not the ending. It's probably 1/7 or 1/5 of the actual story where the secretly-talking-cat has some adventures and little comedy (all different times)

Hello!! I’m currently trying to find any new information on a manga that’s been missing since 2007.

In 2001 the film Osmosis Jones was released and it did insanely badly in the box office, the film had a budget of 75 million and only made 14 million back. 

The reason I’m mentioning this is because they had a whole range of figurines, playsets, snacks and even stuff like soap with the films name on it. The reason I’m bringing this up is because all of this stuff would only get made if the film made a profit of 60 million, which it missed by a long shot.

The film somehow got a spin-off cartoon called Ozzy and Drix, which is where the lost media comes from.

The show has a repeating plot of Osmosis Jones and Drix trying to stop whatever virus, bacteria or other villain from causing havoc on the body they’re in. It was a pretty cool concept, and apparently popular enough in Japan to get It’s own manga.

The only issue with this is only one page has ever been found/posted online. I’ve got proof of the manga existing by one girl’s blog post from 2007, but besides that, these are the only images I've ever seen of its existence.

I’ve tried translating the title of the film and show into Japanese, which is what let me find the original image everyone talks about, and what the cover of the manga looks like.

All it says on the cover is “FILE 0-89’ with a picture of the main characters over it.

The person who owned the manga has been inactive since 2020 and I wasn’t able to contact her.

The person who bought it got it from Comiket, a convention in Tokyo Japan

I know using google translate isn’t the best method, but I don’t speak Japanese and I’m fully relying on google translate to find things about this, so if someone could translate it more accurately, that would be a great help too!!

If anyone has any information on this, it'd be the biggest help ever! Thank you!!",False,manga,1706034596.0,19dv7qj

Looking manga where MC was having S rank adventurer power ?,,"I remember this was isekai where MC was actually very strong but did not realized it. He was like 30 years old or maybe late 20. I remember he was trained by S rank adventurer party because MC want to become strong and protect the world.

He go to guild to become adventurer and need to get past examination.

I remember there is a scene where a drunk adventurer try to seduce receptionist, MC try to stop it and the drunk man try to beat MC back, but MC beat him easily. Turns out the drunk man was a problematic A rank adventurer that have criminal record of beating people.

There is also a dark elf girl who was MC friend and seems like a former S class adventurer. 

One examination , MC meet a snobby little noble kid who was arrogant and have B rank tier magic and show off to mc and insult mc for being 30 years old man and tell him he have no talent.

MC somehow beat him in sparring match and he cry to his older brother who was A rank. The older brother was one of examinee, and also a problematic. No one managed to pass his test to become adventurer , they need to spar with him , and he often beat the people that try to pass his test to half dead and heavily injured him. He also try to seduce the dark elf and want to make her as second wife, but she refused and tell MC was stronger than him.

MC then spar with him and beat him easily. I think he hold grudge and want to kill MC. He also have little sister that hate MC for beating two of his brother. MC later meet him in warrior city, the girl was a sword man, there MC fight with the champion that was kinda wearing lion fur, i kinda forgot.  MC beat him in hand to hand combat and become the new champion.

Can you help me find this?,,"⚠️: I'll resume a lot, because there are some trigger stuff, so be warned.

Long time ago, I found a revenge manga, really cliché.
The story was about a teen girl that... her life went to hell, not literally but almost: her parents died (I think they killed themselves because of debts) and her sister ended up dying after being drugged for... not good reasons, at all.
She was broken to say at least, gone to an abandoned school to jump...
But found a boy dumping a body there.
They agreed on one thing after(of course) she freaked out, the boy was a fucking serial killer, but never killed a girl, he proposed to help her on taking revenge on the guys that made her life like that, if she let him kill her, she agreed.
The manga is cliché as hell, funny, and of course, there's some ecchi, but I have no idea how much because I don't remember it that well.
But...
One thing that I do remember: the manga has no ending, why? Because the writer died.
YES IT ENDED WITH NO ENDING.

* vinland saga
* yona of the dawn
* 20th century boys
* slam dunk
* tokyo revengers
* yugioh

the last two series i read were yu yu hakusho and hikaru no go, which had bad ends, imo, so i was wondering if anyone thinks any of these are significantly better in comparison. i really liked hng, so the end made me sad :( i guess if any of these notably suck, too, you can tell me to avoid it",False,manga,1706064770.0,19e6qry

Looking for an old Lupin III manga series,,"Back when I was a child, my local publisher translated a Lupin III manga series, but they translated the title to a different name, making the series almost impossible to find on the internet.

\- Lupin and gang receive a challenge from a collector to steal Lupin's grandfather journal/diary. Zeginata involved.

\- Goemon went to an inn that has a seal space (closed space with no door) and he find a ghost inside

\- Jigen went to a town to visit a grave, a teen ask to be his apprentice, later challenged Jigen's old nemesis - also his source of revenge - but got killed himself. Jigen killed the nemesis, and the kid's grave is next to the one Jigen visited at the beginning
