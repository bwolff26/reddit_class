Unlike many here, I didn't start with dragon ball, or maybe one piece being broadcasted in localized TV, but instead I got introduced by my cousin, and the anime followed this topic:

>A school, where all the students had a normal life, one day weird messages start reaching their phones, telling them to do small pranks or challenges, or else something bad would happen.

>Next thing I remember, it got worse, each time, and they ended up in a big race, and at some point, one girl was breaking all the fingers of her friend to avoid death

"Help, I'm looking for recommendations",What to Watch?,"Looking for recommendations

I'm trying to be less picky with anime, but after watching a bunch if stuff I just didn't really like i want to take a break and hope to find something I will be more likely to like.

I'm looking specifically for something where the MC is some kind of demon, monster, vampire etc like supernatural type creature. Can be part or full that doesn't matter too much. They can become on later in the show or early on.
I prefer more action based and less romance. Don't really care if its dark or kinda silly. 

Some I've watched and enjoy are:
Blue Exorcist,
Tokyo Ghoul,
Yu Yu Hakusho,
InuYasha,
Fairy Tail,
Toilet Bound Hanako,
Rise of the Yokai Clan,
Seraph of the End,
Attack on Titan,
Case Study of Vanitas,
Soul Eater,
Kemono Jihen,
Chrono Cursade,
Demon Slayer,
Seven Deadly Sins,
Bleach,
Black Clover,
Black Butler

I know it's a rather specific request, but I've always loved supernatural things, and I just want to find something else that peaks my interest. I know there are quite a few that are supernatural but the MC just stays human and something about it bores me more than I care to admit.

If you could recommend something I'd appreciate it, can also be manga I'm good reading if its not animated yet.

Was Misty the worst handled female companion of the Pokemon anime?,Discussion," 

I've  been rewatching the original seasons and  notice how Misty gets  sidelined most of the time. Any time she tries to  battle or do  something epic, Psyduck would come out interrupting her for  the usual  gag.  Outside of that most eps focus on Ash and the random filler  characters  they meet in every ep, so Misty and Brock are largely just  treated as  exposition characters commenting on whatever is happening.   Most of her pokemon are underused too, and it feels like if you don't   care about shipping half the appeal to her character is lost. You'd   think 275 episodes would be enough to develop her but eh.

After  rewatching the entire anime recently I can’t help but realize the   writers never seemed to care for Misty much in the series, at least   after the original Kanto season. Takeshi Shudo the original director of   the first series flat out said he thought Misty was the least justified   Kanto character on the cast and didn’t really contribute much to the   show. He was deciding whether to remove Team Rocket or Misty from the   series by the end of Johto and went with Misty. She then stayed gone   because May became popular with the original fans after she left and the   Contests became the most popular addition to the show at the time, so   that convinced the writers to make her departure permanent, and it’s  why  they even went as far as stopping her cameos for 12 years between  Hoenn  and her recent Sun/Moon cameos.

But back to Misty:

She’s  arguably the least focused on female companion of the series, with  far  less screentime than nearly all the female leads who came after  her.  She’s in the most episodes of course, but she was basically  sidelined  as a background character especially after she got Togepi and  we got  into Johto.

Misty also did the  least amount of battling of the first four main  girls, prior to Serena  and the SM girls, Misty was known for hardly  battling in the show at  all. Most of her battles were constantly  interrupted by Psyduck popping  out, and the few battles she does have  like the Cerulean Gym, match in  the Giselle ep with the kid with the  Graveler, princess day ep, etc,  she either ties, loses or uses other  Pokémon then her own. In Orange  Islands she only battles once the entire  saga against Marina in that  Golduck ep. Then for most of Johto she  barely battles at all, outside  of eps like the Totodile one, till the  tail end with the Whirl Cup.

Misty’s  pokemon were also all underused. Most of her Pokémon with the   exception of Psyduck and maybe Poliwhirl got very little screentime in   the series and no characterization. Most of the time it felt like the   writers forgot Misty even had Pokémon. Her team was mishandled from   start to finish.

That being said I  still like Misty, she had some good eps and she was  better handled  when she returned to the Gym and she got better  development off screen  as a Gym leader than she ever got as a main  character. It’s just too  bad that despite a lengthy run of 275 episodes,  Misty is seldom ever  able to get any focus in the series outside the  odd filler episode.

It’s  interesting how they gave bigger roles to the female leads who came   after her, particularly May, then Dawn, but also even Iris got a bit   more focus, and Serena and Lillie had their characterization too. It’s   also like May was given her tomboyish temper at times, Dawn had the   close friendship with Ash, Iris had Misty’s old role, and Serena got the   crush.",False,anime,1707952842.0,1ar0xgr

Future Diary is underrated. Go watch it,Discussion,"I unironically think Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) is an iconic, pivotal, and masterpiece quality anime.

1) Yuno Gasai is THE yandere. She's the character that has become the basis for the archetype of a ""Yandere"" in all of anime. Also name ONE battle Royale anime you can think of that was better executed than Mirai nikki.

2) The story is both engaging and well written. Great premise and combat mechanics. If you're watching Mirai Nikki, every episode is gripping and has you on the edge of your seat. Pacing is great. Minimal slice of life material, and almost everything that happens is relevant to the plot. It isn't predictable at all either, no one saw the plot twists coming.

3) The production quality is top notch. The sound design: the sound of diaries changing is haunting, the sound of explosions, and just sound effects are well designed. The soundtrack is amazing: watch the show and tell me the action scenes aren't hype thanks to the music. Animation is top notch too: great character design, fluid animation, and great shot composition. You at least have to give it that

The REAL reason people hate Mirai Nikki is because Yuno and Yukki are annoying. There's a solution to that: WATCH IT IN DUB.
- Yunos Japanese voice actress comes off as high pitched and whiny. Her American actress is a lot less annoying for American audience. People underestimate how big of a difference this makes. Same goes for yuki
- Yuki is roasted for being the most pathetic, weak protagonist ever. A lot of people mistakenly take this to mean ""bad character writing"". Yuki is SUPPOSED to be a pathetic, edgy, cringy loser. It's intentional for the plot. Notice how every other character has the same reaction to Yuki as we do: he's NOT supposed to be sympathetic and if you watch all the way through you'll see how he pays for choosing to be weak and letting yuno manipulate him.

Anime that is entirely flashbacks,Discussion,"I'm wondering if there is an anime that's entirely based on flashbacks, meaning that a character from the future could be retelling it, or a character recaps the plot, or it's all apart of the character's memory, something like that.

My favourite example for this is Kakushigoto because it has a mysterious aspect to what happened in the future as we get glimpses into how the past is like.

If this counts, Teasing Master Takagi-san seems to be based off adult Takagi's memories sometimes, as we see her going through an album or remembering the past.

I guess Attack on Titan could count too, Armin is basically recapping/retelling to us

Quintuplets might count as the bride's memories because we see flashforwards of the wedding often

What are some more of these warm/bittersweet openings?,Discussion,"What I mean by warm and bittersweet are these openings that use cuts of the characters just hanging out or going about their days to contrast other more serious things happening in the opening.

I found that these OPs tend to use gestures very well, which help to break out of the monotonous stock actions you usually see in anime like running, fighting, turning, just standing there, hand reaching, dropping into the water and all the clichés.

Do any of you feel similarly about this? What other openings do you know of that use this technique to help craft this sort of mood?

Looking for Anime that tell a complete story within 36 - 52 Episodes,What to Watch?,"As time goes on, I start feeling like 2 cours just isn't clicking for me.

The ones I've seen like Steins;Gate and Summertime Render feel like reeeeally long movies (in a good way). But they don't feel like... A series, if that makes sense. 

2 cours (20 to 26 eps) just feel like it's not enough to give me that fulfilling experience. I want to feel like by the end of it, I did go through this long story with the cast.

So I'm taking anything that starts at the minimum of 3 cours (36 eps) to the max of 4 cours (52 eps). Max of 4 cours because that'll be an entire year's worth of anime in one Binge. Also also! Good pacing would be much appreciated! I can take slow shows, but **slow** shows I can't. My preferred genre (as of writing this) is the more fantastical adventure ones like Lord of the Rings, so having a more ""fun"" story works great, doesn't have to be mature. I'll take a children's story so long as it can be entertaining for people over the age of 12 (I'm 19). 

This season's Sengoku Youko I've heard will tell a complete story within 37 episodes. That sounds great. 

There can be some exceptions like FullMetal Alchemist brotherhood where it goes for 63 eps, but for the lost part still fits? (I say 52 eps, but if something can seriously give me the fulfilment of the FMA ending, I'd take things that go over.)

Seems like the Precure series all tell the main story within 52 eps, I'll check that out. Any genre is fine really. Horror, thriller, action, Shoujo romance, shonen romance, adventure, fantasy, you name it. I'm open to anything so long as its engaging... But no slice-of-life, at least nothing entirely slice of life. 

Death note can fit here. It really did feel like a long journey with Light.

Attack on Titan fits in terms of the progression I want. It feels natural and the conclusion is one thst feels conclusive instead of the ""open to more adventures"" type of ending, but it goes over 100 eps which is way more than what I'm looking for lmao. If I were to pull something from western works (aside from Lord of thr Rings), how to train your dragon 3 felt like a true ending. I'm hoping for something like that. An ending where the story truly feels like its run it's course. 

I'm fine with long shows, so long as the pacing is okay. The issue in found with a lot of old shows (as in shows pre 2000) is how stiff a lot of shows are. I suffered watching shows from the 60s and 70s.

The show being split into multiple seasons is fine too, so long as they ultimately tell 1 big epic story rather than each season feeling like their own contained season. So multiple seasons telling one big story rather than 2nd season or 3rd season feeling more like sequels than a ""direct continuation."" 

Stuff like One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail, ~~Boruto~~ or really most long running battle Shonen's are out. They all go over 100 episodes and most of the time are filled with filler and padding.

On the common complaints I see against revealing armor and gear in fantasy settings.,Discussion,"I absolutely understand that minimal armor covering and form fitting clothing is less effective if you are only considering the pure protection that gear can offer a person.  If that is the only consideration, then every character should always be carrying a massive shield or just never go outside at all.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ygaqgm0jclic1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba1b118d2fa4ecdd0bbec41f09c2eddb6950a6f9

Consider the most common revealing attire you see people wear in real life, in public.  In my experience, it is fitness clothing.  Sports bras, muscle shirts, spandex shorts, small and form fitting items.  Why do people choose those clothes? Because they are easy to move in, which is also the most common response that characters use to explain their choice.  There is also the pride people get from displaying the fruits of their efforts, in the same way others can get from showing off their expensive fashion or other signs of material wealth.

If seeing any display of the things people are proud of is what makes you uncomfortable, I suppose this line of thought may not be very convincing.  But I think it is important to understand that most things in fantasy settings are metaphors for real world things.  For example, there aren't real dragons atop mountains of gold with a princess locked in a tower. But there are old rich people who hoard wealth and have partners that might appear to be unfitting matches for them.

Just something to consider. That said, I don't really hold it against anyone if certain things just make them uncomfortable.  I just think it is important to try to make sure your opinion doesn't ruin somebodies day and to consider their experience, too.

We move onto the next scene, villain is sitting in his office and hears a hiss sound (the noice snake makes, I don't remember if it was rattle or hiss sound). The villain thinks that his aid (the snake woman) has returned and welcomes her back.

"Obscure movies like: ""The House of the Lost on the Cape""?",What to Watch?,"Hi everyone,

I have obviously watched all Studio Ghibli movies etc. but in September last year I stumbled upon ""The House of the Lost on the Cape"" I and I was blown away by how good it was.

There wasn't much info about it on the internet and so I wasn't expecting that it'll have supernatural elements in the form of kappa etc. as no descriptions of the movie even mentioned it.

The art style was amazing, animation was incredible, story very good and it had some of the best music I've heard in any anime.

I'm not really into watching any anime series aside of Dragon Ball when it comes out and I really only watch anime when my partner is away, since she doesn't like it at all. She's currently away for a week and so I wanted to watch some good anime movie.

Long story short: does anyone knows about any other obscure anime movies worth watching and maybe similar to the movie mentioned in the title?

I'd really appreciate some suggestions :).",False,anime,1707912811.0,1aqlgy6

Anime Opening / Ending SONG that gives You strong Nostalgic vibes even if You do NOT know (or keep in mind) the context of it.,Discussion,"My picks (I recommend listening to the FULL versions, not the Anime formats):

&#x200B;

**Berserk's** Ending (""*Waiting So Long*""). It's naturally painful (which fits greatly within the context of the final episode, as well). Maybe too depressing, not leaving that much room for the ""sweet"" part in ""Bittersweetness"" that defines Nostalgia. It may seem more like Melancholy, I guess. But it still gives me the feeling of longing.

&#x200B;

**Oban Star Racers'** Ending (""*Waratteta*""). Probably the best one here after Berserk's, for me. Definitely better balanced than Berserk's, though. After the final episode of the show it hits even harder, just like Berserk's. And I'm not even a fan of this Anime ;p

&#x200B;

**Kill la Kill's** Opening (""*Sirius*""). It's so weird to have KlK here - an extremely action oriented over the top comedy show that doesn't have any particularly sad moments in it, but when I've recently started listening to the song separately, without looking at the images, I've realized how melancholic it is thanks to the chorus. 

&#x200B;

**Mushishi Zoku Shou's** Opening (""*Shiver*""). The official Music Video for this song is nice too.

&#x200B;

**Monster's** Ending (""*For The Love of Life*""). A really beautiful, hypnotizing piece.

&#x200B;

**Saint Seiya's** Endings (""*Blue Forever*"" and ""*Blue Dream*"").

&#x200B;

**Saint Seiya Hades'** Opening (""*Chikyuugi*"").

&#x200B;

**Shin Captain Tsubasa's** Opening (""*So Long Dear Friend*"").

&#x200B;

**Death Note's** Ending (""*Alumina*""). 

&#x200B;

**Shokugeki no Soma's** Opening **(""***Kibou No Uta***"").**

&#x200B;

**Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood's** Ending (""*Uso""*).

&#x200B;

**Naruto's** Opening (""*Namikaze Satellite*"").

&#x200B;

**Naruto Shippuden's** Openings (""*Closer*"" and ""*Diver*"").

Did Anyone See Ninja Kamui Premiere?,Discussion,"What did you think of Ninja Kamui Ep.1? Was it what you expected? Will you be watching this one this season? Did anyone else think it felt like a 10 minute short?  I caught the episode premiere by complete coincidence Saturday night when I just found myself wanting to see what is airing on the Toonami block in current year. What did everyone think of this one? Ninja Kamui? I enjoyed the episode though from start to finish. I’m super interested in where the show goes from here! I hope it becomes a big show for the block! For anyone wondering it’s on Toonami and HBO Max.


Also, for anyone interested in what I thought of the Toonami experience in current year:


Toonami looked like it was in a sad state. There’s the popular series to be expected (DS, Naruto, OP) and Lycoris Recoil I’ve seen online, but there were also a couple series that looked like American cartoons being marketed on the Toonami block. I didn’t recognize them. I was disappointed the block ended early. It used to go until 4am CST when I remember InuYasha used to play. It ended around 3am instead. I also remember for a time it started earlier back when MHA was on the block. Going from the usual 11pm to 10:30pm CST. Is this what streaming has done to Toonami? I love streaming, but I feel bad for the Toonami block. I have so much nostalgia for the block even though I was always primarily an online anime viewer and only a sometimes Toonami viewer. It was still an experience to just watch an episode of a show on tv again without context of the rest of the series. I’m not caught up to DS. I only just started the Entertainment District arc. Ep.5 aired that night.",False,anime,1707886660.0,1aqes93

I know that anime will usually have some loli in it and if there’s like an awkward scene or 2 I will just fast forward. 

I watched most of DanMachi and was fine with it if that gives a reference of what I am okay with watching.

"what is the objectively, unmistakenably, officially crowned most weebiest anime ever?",Discussion,"lets scale from normie to weeb to absolutely lost to us weeb. lets find out together:

the formula for it is how big is the fanbase divided by how known it is in the anime scene plus the square root of how many foreign dubs it got&how many viewers the show got in other non japanese countries to the power of how hopeless you are to have watched it in full.

thats how i concluded durarara is about a 6 on the weeb scale, lucky star is a 7 and yosuga no sora is an 8.5

rules are:

1) just being an ecchi or just being a furry anime or the likes of that no matter how extreme isnt a dead giveaway. highschool dxd was still massively popular, just like how beastars is also pretty big
2) itd be too easy to just go on mal and go to the bottom of the top anime list. instead anime that are just blatantly obscure, look like lost media or had 0 effort in them and like a 100 viewers in general or are just really old dont count. you should still be at least somewhat able to make out an audience somehow
3) if any of you suggest smth like flcl, evangelion or akira youve literally lost your mind

Whats a mundane anime moment that you just can’t seem to forget?,Discussion,"To elaborate on what i mean. Whats a moment in an anime that is completely normal, nothing really happens in the scene that significantly impacts the story or the characters but something about the scene just permanently etches itself in to your memory for whatever reason.

In my case and if we are talking recently. I can’t seem to forget the scene from the dangers in my heart season 1 where ichikawa buys this matching keychain thing with his sister because he intended to give it to yamada as a souvenir from his trip but his sister thought it was because he wanted to have a matching keychain with her. Long story short his sister found out he wanted to actually give his side of the matching keychain to yamada and she leaves her keychain with him so they can match after she realized that he gave his keychain to yamada even though his sister was already using the keychain and was happy to share it with her brother.

Two things made this scene so memorable for me. The sadness that his sister might have felt (i know its a headcanon because it isn’t directly implied that she was sad) knowing that it wasn’t meant for her or just how good of a sister she is for letting them match.

opinion on ''rushed'' anime?,Discussion,"a lot of anime adaptions are unfortunate enough to be rushed, for a variety of reasons.

&#x200B;

while i do find it annoying that a really great manga just didnt get the adaption it deserved, i also contradict myself by enjoying them regardless as a ''alternate story''

&#x200B;

an example of this is Akame ga Kill

&#x200B;

the anime was pretty rushed imo, with a lot of arcs not appearing whatsoever in the anime, and i'll call the anime the ''bad end route'', whereas the manga finished the story, had a ''good end route'' and also got a sequal.

unfortunately, if you only watched the anime, the sequal manga would NOT make sense at all.

&#x200B;

and that takes us to the next point, and where my greatest irritation lies...

&#x200B;

glorified ads for Light Novels.

&#x200B;

there are SO many manga and anime that has ended short because they were just commercial product to get people interested in the Light Novels, one that i was so dissapointed was treated this way was ''Chivalry of a Failed Knight'', with the anime getting an even lamer treatment (aside from obvious good production value), i just find it annoying that a good story thats come far is now axed because they dont need it to commercialize anymore.

animes like monster also fit here,but I am looking for something that requires less braincells and more entertaining

basically edgy, smart and morally questionable mcs or those that are  narcissists with god complex (but also the type of character that will be worshipped on tumblr).

bunch of mind games, better if the mind games involve life or death situations, doesnt actually have to be smart or well written just should be important for the characters

generally dark and angsty vibes, better if the genre is horror but not necessary. 


also it would be great if it has some form of friends to enemies, enemies to friends/lovers, or some heartbreaking betrayal

if you read so far,  it would be great if you can drop some animes down. I do watch anime often, so more obscure or older titles are welcome.

ANSWER TODAY’S QUESTION(S)

What is your favorite bottle episode of anime where it mostly takes place in one setting?

What do you think Maniwa has to say to Mrs. Ikari?

If Maromi is indeed Shonen Bat, how much do you think Tsukiko knows?

Bonus) If I had a nickel for every time Ikari has gotten isekaied, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird it happened twice.

Anime with a unique art style?,What to Watch?,"I've only watched a few anime as i usually read manga, but I've see tons of shows have their unique art style a little diluted when they are turned into anime.

Askeladd's back must hurt from carrying season 1 of Vinland Saga,Discussion,"Askeladd? More like Askechad. This man is the real main character of season 1, having more personality and depth in his fingertips than Thorfinn does in his entire being. Sad that he dies, but I understand why the death was necessary to revive the flat line that was Thorfinn's character arc throughout this season. Second half of the season was definitely better than the first, but I'm still wondering why they chose to make the protagonist the single worst character. The emotional beats of that death scene don't really hit when the protagonist has been insufferable the whole time and there's no reason to really care about his journey in the aftermath of the far more interesting character's death. Season 2 may pleasantly surprise me, but I'm not expecting much.

Her outfit is a striped blue and white shirt, and blue baggy pants. She was probably wearing sandals I think? And her character seems to be that she's scared

The one clip I came across was them jumping into the ocean to escape from some monster of sorts, but they have magic to breathe underwater, they observe some of the ocean life for a bit, until their supposed mentor comes by and takes them to wherever they need to go.

Option A) Light kills 10000's of criminals with a some innocent dying. But he stops all wars and 70% of global crime = millions of people are saved.

Option B) Light does nothing. Our current justice system puts innocents in prison/on death row (4% estimated on death row), wars continue on and the crimes continue on. 

Also our current justice system doesn't convict politicians or people who start wars. Light would.

Isn't Option A just objectively better?

Here's another scenario:

Let's say you are driving and are about to run into some pedestrians.

Option 1) Do nothing and hit an a group of 4 women

Option 2) Turn your car and instead hit a single man.

Option 3) Attempt to stop your car with the possibility of causing an accident and possibly endangering or saving both lives.

I remember the characters having to use a watch gadget (could be sth else)to transform into their battle suits, their suits looked kinda like a mix of kaimen rider and power rangers, i seem to remember they were mainly white costumes.

I also remeber one of the episode plot was a concert/roadshow was under attack and one of the main characters lost his/her gadget and had to scramble to find it, and then the team arrived and kicked butt etc etc,

It could only be a one off episode in another show, i really cant remember, i was in the US and it aired between 1990-2010, or it could be on VHS tapes, i think i remember it having a english dub so it must have been localized.

Does anyone remember Angel Tales?,Discussion,"One night, I was scrolling through Tubi looking for a new anime series to watch and then I stumbled upon Angel Tales. It’s an anime about an unlucky unemployed man in his mid-20s, named Goro Mutsumi, who has trouble finding a job and is down on his luck until one night, he meets a group of teen girls who suddenly appear in his living room and they are his guardian angels who want to be of service to him. These girls are actually his previous pets that past away and were reincarnated into human angels, and their mission is to serve, protect and take care of him. Some of the girls had romantic feelings for Goro and were fighting over who gets to feed/cook for him, buy him medicine, make sure he’s safe, etc., but they were supposed to work together in being at his service, regardless if they were attracted to him. 

I really liked this anime even though I haven’t finished it all. It’s very adorable, sweet, charming, and childlike but it gets sad at times, especially when the girls talk about how they died as pets. This anime is 22 years old (aired in 2001) and I’m just now finding out about it. I highly recommend it to those who love cute or “childish” anime or magical girl, but I wouldn’t call it magical girl since the girls didn’t transform or didn’t have goals regarding saving the world. Their only goal was taking care of Goro. There’s 12 episodes and it’s available on Tubi.

art by anrio -- a collection of some of my favorite characters drawn beautifully,Fanart,"A fun way I've found to cement my love a show/character is to commission art of characters that I like...it's great! You get a bunch of great art, and you get to support real, human artists. You should all do it, regardless of who you commission!

Over the last...year and a half or two, I've ended up commissioning a lot of art, and in particular, a lot of art from an artist whose work I really love, anrio!

A gallery of his work that I've commissioned:
https://imgur.com/a/1PLCPqv

(actually, one of these got posted almost a year ago https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/12xif3u/i_drew_rem_from_rezero/ that was my commission ;)

Regardless, I really love anrio's style. I think it is true to the anime visual style, but also has a sort of...distinct, fashion inspired look to it? I dunno. I just keep coming back with characters I care about, and he keeps making incredible art. I also like artists who draw in a more traditional anime/manga way and have commissioned many, but I appreciate anrio's particular style, I think it's absolutely gorgeous

(note: I did ask anrio if he was cool with this but this was completely on my initiative, not his.

How do you objectively rate an anime?,Discussion,"The recent post about “anime you think are objectively bad” had me thinking about this. Aside from stuff such as animation, voice acting, the art, which I think can be measured objectively in some ways, how do you call an anime objectively good or objectively bad? As in how do you rate an anime based on the more core aspects such as its story, the characters, pacing, plot development, etc. People often mention plot holes and inconsistent character writing but I feel like a lot of plot holes can be interpreted subjectively or might not affect someone’s enjoyment of the story as much as someone else.

1. MHA (This is the anime that gave me the most **radically** intense goosebumps, I've ever felt in my whole life, that i didn't even know was possible to experience, It also has one of the best OP's)
2. Fairy Tail: (I know, don't get me wrong, I am very aware that Fairy tail has some flaws (1. Ironically No blood when a character gets injured, 2. friendship power), but it's one of my first anime, at the time I watched it i was a lving masterpiece, the medieval-themed OST makes me literally experience euphoria, No anime **ever** beats fairy tail in OST's )
3. Tokyo Revengers: It has one of the best openings in the history of anime, The magical emotions I felt while watching it, The amount of tears I shed, The liberating experiences It made me undergo, The dramatic personality of Takemichi, The legendary delinquent, gang street fighting theme that was unheard of before
4. OP: Anyone who has watched long running anime, knows the profound bonds you develop with the characters, The way the drama is expressed here, is legendary, Luffy's character development is #1 in the history of anime
5. Date A Live: the G.O.A.T romance drama  + really great battles
6. Tensura: Every time I sit down to watch this anime felt like a breath of fresh air from life. It’s just so **fun**, it gives off a super tranquilizing vibe to watch + it has epic action scenes + crazy, Fluid animation
7. JJK: Self-explanatory
8. Kobayashi's Dragon Maid:  It's the best SOF anime I've ever seen, Nice storyline, very Funny, heartwarming moments, and most importantly, CGDCT <3 
9. Undead unluck: Very unique plot, magical OST and OP's , crazy events and gorey fights make it an immersive bizarre adventure

Why do people love anime so much? not trying to hate,Discussion," 

I have been wondering why people are so in love with anime and i am not trying to talk shit or hate.  


I have some friens i play games and talk to a lot in discord and they watch a lot of anime together in there but i never get the feeling that i like any of them, and i know many of you will say ""you have not found the right one yet"" but i have seen so many different ones now by just watching what they watch in discord its been animes like JJK, Hunter hunter, AOT, solo leveling, Spy x Family, Love is war and the list goes on

And i was wondering what makes people so obsessed with anime? Like i said i am not trying to talk shit or hate but for me from the outside people who watch anime are kind of like vegans, its all they talk about and only thing they talk about on the internet, all the pfp that they use is anime ones and all the gifs is always anime ones, I think its nice people have found something they really love and for me that is Lord of the Rings i watch that shit so many times a year i even watch so much lore videos to learn everything about it but i am not throwing it around everywhere that i love Lotr or even if i meet another guy that also loves it i just be like ""oh shit nice me too"" and i move on but i feel like a lot of people who love anime only talks about anime

So if anyone of you guys out there have any answers from your pov on what makes you be so ""obsessed"" with it

Was Pluto underwhelming as a mystery story?,Discussion,"Maybe i had my expectations too high when people said this was one of their favorite mystery animes and don't get me wrong it had some great character moments especially the whole north no 2 segment,  epsilon and his connection with the kids and Gesicht's whole arc .

While it excels at exploring these characters the overall plot and mystery was lacking. After the whole build up over 2 or 3 episodes they just throw the answer right in our face.  Like sure the main details were still uncovered but we knew Abullah was heavily involved the moment he showed up.


I might have missed these so ill hv to ask:  

1. how does pluto magically have the abilty to change the weather grow flowers etc


2. Is dr tenma stuipd?  He created the most advanced robot who is now impersonating a high official of a dangerous country and he does nothing for years?  

3. What was the deal with brau? He somehow knew everything abt everyone and the best part upon atom's request he is able to escape prison ,  intercept the secret room of a powerful president and shoot the main villian. Speaking of whom was it even explained in the show what his deall was? 

4.  They had to introduce hate in the most advanced robot to make it work yet brau and Gesicht were able to feel hatred by just going thru stuff? Why doesn't every robot who suffers hv a similar thing feel these emotions then?

5. So if they tried hard enough or had a genius like tenma helping all the dead robos can be revived like atom was?

6.Also i get suspension of disbelief but some of the most famous ppl/robots are being picked apart 1 by 1 and u basically have only 1 primary detective robot on the case working at his own pace?  They just sent Gesicht to warn them to be safe.  Not rounding them up and hv them under 24/7 surveillance nothing.

7. Everytime someone makes a breakthrough they barely share it and worse yet try confronting pluto alone despite the same the same thing happening again and again.  

8. Maybe the manga explains it better but why were so many characters just stuipd did the president have no brain of his own or that lady at epsilon's orphanage letting them take the kid behind his back.

Theres also small issues like sometimes conviently flying arnd in the car to reach across the ocean yet struggling to loose a tail while driving on the road etc.,  rumors of goji existing before he was even created.

Kingdoms of Ruin is horribly overhated.,Discussion,"To start by no means am I going to claim this show as some kind of masterpiece, however calling it trash is a pretty bad take. 

The animation is amazing. The story and characters go hand in hand and simultaneously progress and influence each other, the world-building is really solid and while the side characters aren't that interesting as of yet, the main cast compensates for it.

Based on the reviews and responses I have read , it mostly comes down to people having very wrong expectations about the show. The biggest consensus is that people expected Mc to just spend all 12 episodes mindlessly genociding everyone however the story takes a step back instead, to further develop the characters and the plot which I liked a lot.

Now it does have plenty of problems, my personal biggest gripe being that it has one of the most versatile power systems used in one of the least versatile ways. Other than that it was a very enjoyable show with some nice but not mindblowing plot twists. Overall I would give it a very weak 8.

**3)** Gold vs Silver Instruments (when the choice is available)? 

**Comments from Yesterday:** 

These may not be the actual best ones (there are upvotes y'know), but well, I decided to pick them. (i.e. completely subjective by me lol)

The Boondocks - Japanese Dub: A Case for Cultural Preservation in Localised Translations,Discussion,"One of the classic scenes in the American animation of Boondocks is when Huey was explaining the intricacies of the ""N-word moment"". In addition to the localised Japanese translations for Japanese audiences, the American cultural connotation of the N-word was preserved very well by allowing the dub to literally use the same amount of N-words in that very scene, despite the offensive nature of how the N-word was supposedly meant to be used by black Americans within that culture.  


This is a case for an argument against English localisation of Japanese animation where the Japanese cultural context can sometimes be modified, or worse, removed, simply because it didn't ""feel right"" with American audiences.  


In short, if American animation such as Boondocks can allow Japanese localisers to say the literal N-word for the preservation of contemporary American culture, surely American localisers can also seek to preserve the Japanese cultural context in Japanese animation? If Japanese dubs can be allowed to say the N-word, surely, American dubs can be allowed to at least be allowed to use the senpai and kōhai culture when they are localising Japanese animation?  


The senpai and kōhai culture is simply one example I have seen American localisers REMOVE for the sake of ""flow"" and ""American audiences"". There are plenty of other cultural contexts in Japan that Americans censor sometimes because it didn't fit certain ""progressive"" or ""inclusive"" values that didn't work in the same way in the context of Japanese society.

Which anime ruined another anime that was your favorite,Discussion,"I think we are biased towards anime we watch before many others, always comparing it, finding similarities between them. It doesn't matter if the anime we watch first is more recent than any older anime we may watch later, it's not the release order, it's your watch order that matters. I believe only after you watch a certain amount, you can stop comparing shows needlessly.

Even then, what is that one anime which ruined other similar ones? Which anime was strong enough to force you to overwrite your favorites in certain genres? What **was** your favorite, and what is your favorite **now**?",False,anime,1707763310.0,1ap7ci1
Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny: The darkest storm in the Cosmic Era,Writing,"The last few CE stuff was whatever, but this anime is absolute dogshit. The story is just the 1st series & Zeta smashed together into one incoherent mess. The returning characters are complete shells of themselves. The new characters are hardly likable. And worse of all, anything that made the original special is completely gone. It's now 2004 and nearly every anime was the same; overly edgy, too violent, and of course poorly animated. This was often called the worst entry in the series and it's time to find out why.

* Plot:
   * 2 years after the Bloody Valentine War, ZAFT not has their Gundams stolen, but are now made a scapegoat for the break the world incident. So it's up to the Minerva crew to fight off the Earth Alliance. Meanwhile they encounter the Archangel and must decide if they're for or against them.
   * Right off the bat it adds nothing new. It prides itself in mainly being on ZAFT’s side of the conflict, and honestly it's not even an interesting concept at all since we've seen their perspective already in the previous show. That's why I never understood why this was the main selling point since it was done already.
   * Also like the 1st show, it copies entries from old entries. This time around, it copies Zeta Gundam to…… Not very positive results. It only copies the superficial parts and not much else. Like it copies the fight with the Psycho Gundam, but understanding what made it good (and I'll get to that). Or certain MAIN CHARACTERS, it's easy to see where they flopped. And to add insult to injury, it also copies the 1st SEED too, with 3 modified children stealing Gundams. Hell, the second half of the series just rips off SO MUCH of the original SEED when it comes to fights. Kira getting his ass blown up & surviving to even the final fight in space, it's nearly the same anime beat for beat.
   * So we're not off to a great start. This show barely tries anything new and when it does it fails miserably. It just feels like the plot is constantly having an identity crisis. And I'm not even at the bottom of the barrel.
* Characters:
   * If you thought the characters in the last show were a mixed bag, it has nothing on these guys. They really dropped the ball on these guys, from returning characters being underdeveloped to new characters that nobody asked for, there's a lot to discuss. So just this once, I'm only gonna focus on the characters who desperately needed a rewrite. So to any Lunamaria and Talia simps, I won't be talking about those 2, along with other characters.
   * First let's start off with the one who could've easily saved this anime, Athrun Zala. I've praised him for having a really good character arc where he learns that ZAFT aren't as good as he thought. Yet he doesn't have a character arc whatsoever. Anything he does in this anime is the same thing he's done in the previous anime. All he does is babysit a hellspawn and commit adultery.
   * Speaking of which, let's talk about how much they butched Cagalli. She's basically an old shell of herself and just follows along whatever happens. She did show promise in the beginning as she now runs Orb and even towards the end when she gets her own Gundam (again), but not only does she lose control towards the middle, she also doesn't even use her new Gundam. She only used the damn thing once and that's it, talk about wasted potential.
   * Another woman with little to nothing to do is definitely Murrue Ramius. I'm surprised barely one brings up how much wasted potential she has as she also doesn't do a damn thing till Neo reveals his true identity, and oh boy… Do I have some to say about that. It turns out this mysterious Char Clone is no other than…….MU LA FUCKING FLAGA. Ya, the man who got vaporized by a fucking warship survived. I'm not even mad that he survived something as insane as that, I'm more mad that they only brought him back just to give Murrue something to do. Seriously, almost all of the returning  characters are treated like garbage compared to new characters.
   * Speaking of which, let's talk about them for a second, they're not really the worst, but boy do they fumble with some of them. The “Extendeds” would've been interesting characters, but they get heavily mud balled halfway through the series. Sting Oakley & Auel Neider are honestly underutilized as they barely get any chance to shine as characters or get any form of redemption as they're just brutality killed off. The only one who gets to shine is Stella Loussier. And her one interesting trait is that she's “afraid of dying”, huh? Ok, the fear of death is a really relatable trait, but not to the point where scratching people's faces off or attacking them when the word “death” is even mentioned. Like, Jesus woman, get a grip. But outside of that, she's dipsy I guess, it's kinda hard to describe her.
   * While we're on the subject of villains, let's talk about these 2 dipshits; Lord Dijbril & Yuna Roma Seiran. One is the most evil & the other is just a straight up dumbass. Both of these assholes aren’t even effective enough villains who feel like a threat, they just feel a tedious obstacle.
   * But there’s one character who I utterly despised, a character who make the anime worse by appearing, Shinn Asuka. He’s easily the worst character in the anime, or better yet, the worst Gundam protagonist period. I know say that for at least one character for these reviews, but this time I mean it. He’s whinny, he talks down to everyone, and never takes responsibility for his actions. If anything, honestly the worst written character in the series. He doesn’t have any form of character development, his perspective on ZAFT is never challenged, and he honestly has a really dumb motivation to hate Orb. He hates Orb because of the invasion of the Earth Alliance and blames them for not beating them sooner? That sounds like you should be against EA more than Orb, who actively tries to protect its citizens. A lot of people say he would've been a good character and those people are on crack. I just don't think he would've been a good character to begin with.
   * While I've spent most of my time bitching about how bad these characters are, there are still characters I think are alright. Gilbert Durandal is honestly a pretty decent villain as his political power is what makes him untouchable with his grasp on information control. Meer Campbell could've also served as a compelling character as someone impersonating her hero, and seeing the toll it's taking on her mentally. Hell, I genuinely felt sad for her death as she just wanted to be like Lacus. Now speaking of vich, I thought Lacus did way more to do here than the previous show, as she exposes Durandal’s shady actions and brings Athrun's Gundam by piloting it herself.
   * However, there's honestly one elephant I want to address before ending the characters section, Kira Yamato. Everyone says he's the worst in this show, but if I'm being honest, he's probably one of the only character in the show who I can actively stand. He's not as good as he was in the previous show, but I was honestly more invested in his side of the story opposed to Shinn’s or Athrun’s, because it's him & Terminal up against all 3 factions. That's more interesting than one dude babysitting a man-baby who can't control himself. However, there's one thing that’s holding him back from being a good character, his plot armor. I didn't mention this in the first SEED review since that felt irrelevant at that point, but now it's worth discussing. Not once, but twice he survived his Gundam getting blown up in the most over the top way. I think instead, his Gundam should've just been heavily damaged and sunken into the ocean. These fights already take place over the sea, so just having it sink would show off how the fight was while not shutting down the idea that Kira could've survived. I dunno, if Heero can survive that kinda shit, why can't Kira. I also thought that fighting against the Destroy Gundam was dumb, but I'll get to that later.
   * So overall, the characters really fell flat, REALLY FLAT. What's worse is that they could've been good characters if written differently. I remember hearing why most of the characters were poorly written because there was some in-fighting between the writers in the studios. And that's such a shame because studio drama will always reflect on the final product in some shape or form (take a look at Blade Trinity). So overall, the characters range from wasted potential to why do they exist.
* World building:
   * The world building is also a mess because of how it barely adds anything to its universe. For starters, we're not supposed to question how fast Orb gets its land back. Because the 1st anime took place in CE 70, this anime takes place in CE 72, 2 years later. Jesus those coordinators have fast hands. And that's just the beginning, the Junius Treaty also adds nothing to the plot. Apparently, they banned N-Jammers, N-Jammer Cancellers, and Mirage Collide for military use. And yet here they are used for whatever tomfoolery EA & ZAFT are up to. Even the limit of the number of mobile weapons is pretty stupid. The Earth Alliance sure as hell ain't following that shit, just look at the amount of Windams & Daggers they deployed after the Minerva.
   * Speaking of stupidity, Electronic Arts has become completely stupid. Like, after the world incident, they instantly try to launch a nuclear strike against the colonies. Of course it was stopped by ZAFT, but the fact that they quickly did that proves how utterly dumb EA has become. What's also stupid as fuck is Orb wanting to join the Earth Alliance. Whoever came up with this idea clearly needs a Gundam sized smack in the head. WHY IN GOD'S NAME WOULD YOU WANT TO SIDE WITH A GROUP OF GENOCIDAL XENOPHOBIC MANIACS? This anime is filled with people losing brain cells.
   * And ZAFT ain't off the hook either. Okay I'll say this, they're pretty compemdantt at the beginning with them handling the break the world incident and exposing the truth about the Earth Alliance. And then towards the end, they suddenly decide to unveil a plan called the Destiny Project, where it decides your future for you. And that sounds so stupid and I'm surprised that none of the civilians thought this idea was stupid to. Okay, the concept itself isn't a bad idea, it's the fact that it's into the last half of the show when it was about to wrap up. How easily were you shown by Captain America: The Winter Soldier of all things. But one plot point that never gets resolved is the “Break the World Incident”. This could've been interesting to see, a civil conflict in ZAFT where they are fighting against future & past ideals. But then, the anime forgot who was responsible for the break the world incident and everyone just blamed ZAFT for it, even though they tried to blow the fucking thing up.
   * No amount of words can express how much this anime fumbles with its world building. It keeps making you wonder how things got to the way they are. It really doesn't do the Cosmic Era any favors.
* Mobile Suits:
   * When I said the CE suits carried this series, it's especially true here. The plot, characters, and world building may be horse shit, but I would be lying if I said the mobile suits weren't the saving grace. These are some decent mobile suit designs and some well. Hell if anything, this anime is great for some mindless Mecha action if you hate the story that much. But there are some designs that I'm just not a fan of.
   * So starting off the main Gundam, the Impulse. It's an alight design I guess, but it has 2 of my Mecha pet peeves; needless combination gimmick & changing colors. The Impulse has a core fighter called the “Core Splenda” that combines with the chest, legs, & arms. It also changes colors depending on what pack it is. Not only does it make collecting those kits a nightmare, but also adds a gimmick that doesn't add too much. I already talked about this issue in my Victory Gundam, so I won't elaborate. It is smart however that it can regain energy from its ship via microwave beam. It's creative and is useful in battle.
   * And it has some decent toys too; by itself it just has vulcans, a beam shield, a beam rifle, and some knives. But when it combines with its Silhouette parks, that's when it gets its goodies.
      * The Force Silhouette park has a back booster with a pair of beam sabers.
      * The Sword Silhouette pack had 2x Excalibur Anti-Ship sword and 2x beam boomerangs.
      * And the Blast Silhouette pack has 2x cannons with missiles, 2x rail-guns, & 2x beam javelins (makes sense for a long range machine).
   * While these are some good weapons, I'm not gonna ignore the fact that this is just the Strike Gundam. They have the same gimmick & the silhouette packs serve the same purpose as the Striker Packs.
   * The Savior on the other hand isn't a rehash of the Aegis and has some differing traits as well. Outside of the usual stuff every MS has, there are also two kinds of cannons on top of each other, which are from Freedom and Justice. It could use these weapons in MA mode too that doesn't look like an ugly ass squid and instead a cool looking fighter plane. Now that's a glow up.
   * We do get more ZAFT exclusive Gundams (or more specifically the ones that weren't stolen) as we got the Destiny Gundam and Legend Gundam, both of which are pretty decent machines. The Destiny in particular actually looks good and has the equipment to boot. These include, but not limited to, a high energy long range beam cannon, a big ass beam sword, 2x beam palms that's mostly used for close combat opposed to it original use as a range weapon, 2x beam boomerangs, and standard crap these Gundams are to use. It also has beam wings, which is cool. As for the Legend Gundam, which is basically just a remaster of the Providence Gundam, but with 2x beam javelins, no mega man arm, and a big ass sword. So not too much.
   * Now let's go to Grand Theft Gundam and check out the stolen goods. It ain't a SEED show if we don't have some stolen Gundams, and this show got 'em in spades. Starting off with the Chaos Gundam, it's a pretty interesting machine with a good looking MA mode. It has about the same Weapons as the Blast Impulse, along with some beam sabers, beam claws, and a couple of machine guns. And the transforming Gundams don't end there, as the rest of them are good as well.
   * The Abyss Gundam has cannons for days, some torpedoes, CIWS guns, and a good ol beam lance. It can also transform for some aquatic action.
   * And finally there's the Gaia Gundam, which is one of my favorite machines. I like some black Gundams, what can I say. It has a couple CIWS guns, 2x beam sabers, 2x beam cannons, and beam blades on its wings. It can also transform into a dog, need I say more? It's such a shame that EA didn't incorporate their tech into their other mobile suits, but whatever.
   * Now on to the other stolen Gundams that weren't used by a group of xenophobes. While the Freedom did make a return, it's the Strike Freedom along with the Infinite Justice where it's at. The former being a sight for sore eyes. The gold really does add a lot to the angelic aesthetic. It also has about the same equipment, but this time it has a beam shield, 2x beam rifles that can combine into one, a belly button cannon, and of course DRAGOONS. Now this thing is a beast. As for the Infinite Justice, it's about the same as the original Justice in both looks and equipment, but now with blades on its legs & wings. Lacus always knows what to steal for her 2 boys.
   * The next 2 new Gundams remain on their respective sides, but they also lead to 2 plot points that definitely ruins the anime. The Destroy Gundam, a Psycho Gundam copycat that can also turn into a copycat of the Big Zam with a metric shit ton of beams and dragoons. And yet it lead to both Shinn and Kira to lose a bunch a of brain cells, as one tries to protect someone who's trying to kill a bunch of innocent people in a defenseless town, as for the other, despite know for EFFORTLESS DISARMING MOBILE SUITS WITHOUT KILLING THE PILOTS, decides to kill this one. All I can say is these 2 things;
      * 1.) This scene would work INFINITELY BETTER if Kira was replaced with Athrun and
      * 2.) Unicorn did it better.
   * As for the Akatsuki, don't get me wrong it's a cool looking suit, with its reflective golden armor, funnels, and all, but for god sakes it's as much as wasted potential as Cagalli's involvement in the story. She only uses the thing twice & that's it, letting Mu use it towards the end. These 2 Gundams are cool & all, but CHRIST did lead to the worst plot points in the anime.
   * At least there's some returning Gundams, namely the Strike Rouge & Freedom. The Latter is largely the same, so I won't go into detail. As former, while having the same weapons, it does have a new Striker Pack, the Ootori striker pack. Equipped with the Beam Launcher, a big ass sword with beam edge, some railguns, and a metric shit ton of missiles. It's also interesting to see if it changes from its pink color scheme to the original scheme once Kira uses it for a bit.
   * This may be a lot, but these are just the Gundams. We still got the ZAFT MSs, which is already over a handful. We already got the CGUE, Dinn, BuCUE, G00hn, & Zn0 do return along with a now variant of the GuAIZ called the GuAIZ R with a pair railguns add to it's arsenal this time. As for the new machines, we got the transforming BABI with missiles and 2x kinds of rifles, the tank GAZu00T with missiles & cannons, the aquatic ASH with missiles, beams, & claws and the Geo G00hN being a modified G00hN.
   * And then ZAFT grow a hard on for zeonic designs and basically brought into the CE. There are 3, count em, THREE ZEONIC DESIGNS. Starting of with the ZAKU Warrior (coming with a beam shield, tomahawk, hand grenades, beam assault rifle, heavy assault machine gun, recoilless cannon, & Heavy) which is basically just a Zaku with multiple Striker Packs….I mean “Wizard Packs”;
      * Gunner ZAKU (Beam Cannon)
      * K Slash ZAKU (back Gatling guns)
      * Blaze ZAKU Warrior (Missiles)
      * and the ZAKU phantom (2 spikey Shields).
   * these looks slightly different than the og, so I'll give it that. There's also one for “Lacus”, but it doesn't do a damn thing so I won't count it.
   * Next is the GOUF Ignited with about the same load out of the original; Heat rod & wrist mounted 3-barreled gun. It also has a double beam bladed sword (seriously what the hell is with the Cosmic Era and beam edged swords? Is it even that different from a regular beam saber or a more powerful beam saber).
   * And finally, there's the DOM Trooper (technically it's Terminal’s mobile suit, but since it was made by ZAFT, it still counts). Again, same equipment with a CE twist (a big Bazooka and an actual beam saber instead of the usual heat saber), but now it has a beam shield & the “Screaming Nimbus” (aka the super star from Mario). I don't have too much about these 3, they're just like the original, but SEED-ified. One thing that both the UC & CE make a constant, any side associated with any regime starting with a “Z” will always have a lot of mobile suits with mono eyes to make the fan boys ignore their war crimes.
   * Speaking of war crimes, let's talk about EFF’s much more fucked up twin, EA and their mobile suits. While VERY little compared to ZAFT, these 4 suits still deserve some love. Starting off with a MSV suit that FINALLY made an appetite, the Dagger (or as some call it, the 105 Dagger). It was originally made to be the 1st mass produced mobile suit for the Earth Alliance, but was too expensive. It's basically a more stripped down version of the Strike, but still retains the ability to switch Striker Packs. Outside of some equipment from both the Strike Dagger & Striker Packs, it also has a machine gun & beam carbine, which is just a semi auto beam pistol.
   * Next is its more successful descendant, the Dagger L. It keeps it's ability to switch Striker Packs AND it's cheap to produce. It has the same stuff, CIWS guns, foot machine guns, 2x hipped beam sabers, a shield, the aforementioned beam carbine, some exploding Kunais and now a bazooka like recoilless cannon.
   * And finally there's the Windam, the apex of OMNI’s engineering. Similar weapons to the previous 2 units, but now has a more long & curvy rifle and a bladed shield with some missiles. And it doesn't end there, outside of being able to use the original Striker Packs, it has 3 new packs that the Dagger L can also use.
      * The Jet Striker Pack with a lot of missiles on the wings
      * the Doppelhorn Striker Pack for 2x cannons
      * the Multi-Striker Pack to nuke your enemies to oblivion
   * With all this might and mechanical superiority, they were ready to….get their ass kicked multiple time to show off ZAFT's plot armor. Not even Neer’s Custom Windam managed to keep up.
   * There's also the Forbidden Vortex (being a cheap version of the original Vortex), Zamza-Zah, & Gells-Ghe (both being mobile armors), but they're not as memorable as the previous suits. EA may be some idiotic xenophobes, but they upped their MS game hard.
   * Finally, there's ORB. Outside of the returning M1 Astray, all we got is the Murasame. It's basically just a transforming Astray with missiles & vulcans for days. It has a beam gun on its tail wing too. And in case you're gonna ask, the Murasame, M1 Astray, and Forbidden Vortex are as much Gundams as the Hazels are Gundams (only true Gundam fans will understand that reference).
   * So that's every single mobile suit I've cared to count in this damn anime. These are just the ones that appeared on screen, and I haven't even talked about the MSVs. All I can say is that these designs sure as hell made the anime more enjoyable than it has any right to be. Doesn't stop it from being a dumpster fire though.
* Verdict:
   * The TL;DR of this anime is, it truly sucked. Poorly structured plot, nearly all of the characters aren't likable in the slightest, and near to nothing to the Cosmic Era. The only redeeming factor is the Mecha fights, that and the music is pretty (except the last 2 openings, those sucked). I think the worst thing about this anime is that it just retreads story beats from SEED. And I think that's when a sequel fails when it repeats what its predecessor did. It just reminds us how much better the original is. And to add insult, like Fairy Dance to SAO, Destiny made the Cosmic Era look bad in the public when in reality it wasn't as bad. If Destiny focused on telling an original story, expanding on the original cast, either nutter or improving the new characters, adding more to the Cosmic Era, and making the grunts less pathetic to service the main characters, THEN we'll probably have a good follow up to SEED. But instead, it joins IBO season 2, Build Fighters Try, & ZZ as my least favorite follow ups to a Gundam series. It is truly sad that it ended up like this.",False,anime,1707763017.0,1ap77w9

Recommend me a great shounen,What to Watch?,"Hi, it's my first time posting here :D

I am looking for a new anime to watch. I feel like i am running out of good shounen. Please prove me wrong! (Something modern would be preferred)

So far i have watched:  
\- Dragonball Z/super   
\- Demon slayer  
\- Jujutsu Kaisen  
\- Fairytail  
\- Black clover  
\- Seven deadly sins  
\- HxH  
\- Hero academia (only season 1) I didn't enjoy it.

 whether you like it or not when you start a show in sub to you those are the voices for the character everything else will sound weird same with dub. so how can you really find out what's better for you simple watch a bit of both and decide what you like more not good enough?

SLF had no need to go so hard while solo leveling is being so mid. But they did.,Discussion,"Disclaimer: Solo Leveling manwha is one of my favorite, but.

Shangri-La Frontier is a way better anime than Solo Leveling is right now and may ever be.

Did you watch Shangri-La Frontier episode 18 ??? It aired yesterday, same week as Solo Leveling episode 6.

What the hell ?? There was no one drinking coffee mid-fight, no flashback interrupting important scenes, no unrelated training sequence in between two attacks and the animation was top tier ???

So you are saying this was possible all this time ?

A-1 really did us dirty with the pacing of Solo Leveling it should have been incredible it is just the middest of mid animes and the only redeeming quality it has is the **C H I N** and Sawano's genius.

Perhaps people like it when the epic and cool scenes are split by useless still images and voiceover. I'd like to have your opinion on this.",False,anime,1707748766.0,1ap1hat
Vinland Saga honest thoughts so far,Discussion,"I'm 9 episodes in, and... I don't understand the hype.

Series started out ok, but given that this series is supposed to be a ""realistic"" seinen, it seems like this series still suffers with one and a half dimensional characters who feel like they were ripped out of a battle shonen and stuck in a slightly edgier setting. 

Thors is written to pull a complete 180 and become a pacifist  in basically an instant, no time given to develop that change in his attitude towards war. And his character afterwards is basically Jesus.

Thorfinn is basically your typical angsty broody overpowered protagonist with one very simplistic goal and nothing else. The only thing keeping me watching is his dynamic with Askellad, who is actually an ok character so far. I don't know where Thorfinn's character development is going to go, but if he becomes the exact same person as ~~Jesus~~ Thors, I'll be frustrated.

Does anyone else feel the same way about (early) Vinland Saga? Does it get better?",False,anime,1707748652.0,1ap1fut

Anime with Travolta and Thurman dance scene from Pulp Fiction,Help,"I've tried asking in the daily thread and yield no result. I've also tried googling and looking at youtube, but also yield no result.

Several weeks ago I watched this scene either on OP or ED of an anime. I slightly remember that the OP/ED also referenced other pop culture (I think the theme is MC as an actress?).

I believe this is from a recent anime. However, for the love of God, I couldn't find it in any of my current watch list that it's driving me crazy

For those who doesn't know the scene that I mentioned, please see this short clip.

Romance anime where the protagonist is a gigachad instead of a shy mess?,What to Watch?,"I've started to get sick of this trope of these cringe ass protagonists that lose their minds when a girl touches them for 0.4 nanoseconds. I want some anime where the protagonist has balls, and there is a clear and convincing reason for the other party to like them as opposed to blatant wish fulfillment of pretty girl likes loser guy.

Some good examples of what I'm looking for are Sakuta from BGS and the council president from Tsuredure Children.

And if I were to specify a border it would be between Gojo from Dress up Darling and Tomoya from Saekano. 

In Gojo's case the reason is there and he isn't a loser, but he's still shy and self conscious around Marin so he fails, whereas Tomoya, who as an otaku would be labeled a (self-proclaimed) loser, has some impressive displays of audacity, so he gets a pass.

Any good animes to watch?,What to Watch?,"I am not new to anime. I have been watching for 5 years roughly and have seen alot of different animes.

I've been playing video/computer games for 20 years and I still don't know what 'game' all these isekai worlds are based on.,Discussion,"There are THOUSANDS of interesting fantasy and sci-fi worlds that exist in gaming media. All of them have a semblance of world building, some even containing original or bespoke elements. Similarly, although fantasy fiction lays itself on the shoulders of literary icons like Tolkien or Moorcock; every author still tries to make their worlds interesting. And the ones that are 'generic' generally don't become popular enough to get exported to Japan.

Wizardry isn't even the most popular RPG system. It's Call of Cthulhu.

And the legacy of Wizardry (Dragon Quest, Granblue, Final Fantasy and a few others) have all evolved to have uniquely deep fantasy worlds.

And if we are to talk about gaming media in Japan; year after year, the most popular games in Japan are:   
For consoles: Pokemon, Mario, Zelda, Fire Emblem, Monster Hunter;   


For PC: FPS games like Apex, Valorant or co-op survival types (if we go off the Steam store).

Absolutely NONE of the popular media that exists in Japan seems to correlate to 'generic' fantasy. But for some fucking reason, every isekai world is almost identical to another, based on some kind of fantasy media that I can't even fathom. What the fuck kind of terrible game is the basis for all this isekai trash?",False,anime,1707736216.0,1aoxm1m

Why are anime Blu-rays so expensive?,Discussion,"With the whole crunchyroll funimation merge thing recently I've been looking more into anime blu-ray sets as I generally enjoy owning physical media and thought this could be a pretty good time to look into getting anime physically. I checked out the Banana Fish Blu-ray set (second hand)  because i have a huge banana fish collection and found it to be £427.80 which is absurd for 24 episodes of anime. Jojo's in total is also over £200 total. Egregious.

I've known for a while that they were all pretty expensive but I've never really questioned why. Is there a reason? Surely they aren't this expensive in Japan? I've checked out a bunch of other serie's prices and they're all ridiculous, even very very short series have prices well over £250...

Funimation and physical copies,Help,"Since Funimation is shutting down or fully merging with Crunchyroll. Does this mean we won’t be getting physical anime anymore? I personally like truly owning my stuff. I have noticed that physical copies tend to look and sound better than the streaming counterparts (at this point in time). Also, I noticed that the physical copies tend to remove the “anti seizure” elements that they have in the streaming ones. Like darkening of images, which has always bothered me. Besides getting the animation itself cleaned up. Anyways, does this mean there will be a massive drop in physical anime or will they still release physical copies under the Crunchyroll name? 🤔",False,anime,1707731577.0,1aowh42

Keep in mind that this is someone who used to vehemently hate anime.

Why aren't Sentai's anime licenses releasing on Bluray in Australia any more?,Help,"I recently noticed several Sentai-licensed anime I was interested in buying never seemed to get Australian Bluray release dates. After [inquiring with customer support](https://i.imgur.com/pslVl2D.png) provided no clear answer, I resorted to checking every single Sentai monthly slate for local releases until I found one.

The last one I could find was Rent A Girlfriend Season 1, which released **nearly two years ago in May 2022** (Dec 2021 in the US). 

Preceding that was DanMachi Season 3 (Mar '22/Dec '21), Vinland Saga (Nov '21/Aug '21), and Dororo (Oct '21/Jun '21).

**Not a single title released after December 2021 according the US release slates has ever been released physically in Australia.** This includes some popular titles such as Made in Abyss S2, Ya Boy Kongming, Call of the Night, and Clannad. Accordingly, this also applies to upcoming releases.

I note that the AU distributor market has changed a lot in recent years, with Madman being bought up and converted to Crunchyroll AU (RIP Animelab), and both Hanabee and Siren Visual, who often released Sentai titles in the past, seemingly going out of business some time ago. 

Still though, it seems a bit rude to just totally exclude us from home video release. What gives?

For reference, every title I checked is below. It's fairly likely that there are some from even before that which didn't get released in Australia either.

How to sell a fight scene (Comparing JJK and Ninja Kamui),Discussion,"I won't make this super analytical, but I just wanted to gush over Ninja Kamui's pilot episode really quick and spout some late AM incoherent thoughts before I hit the bed.

With Ninja Kamui right off the bat the general animation and choreography were fantastic in this episode and hopefully keeps the same level of quality, but the element that really sells the fight scenes in this episode is the utilization of the art of knowing when to shut the fuck up.

The biggest sin of this for me in JJK S2 was the very beginning of the Yuji vs Mahito fight. Every time I watch the clip of Nanami going through this beautiful send off and then going into the stellar voice work between Mahito and Yuji's VAs for it all to get squandered by this, for the lack of a better phrase, dog shit music to start playing completely breaks me out of the emotional build up the viewer just went on for the last five minutes. It's so incredibly disappointing.

I look back at my unenjoyment of JJK S2 and disregarding the common critiques you've already heard, I just think JJK's music choice overall doesn't sell the mood they're trying to go for most of the time and ends up working against the anime more than helping it, even though it's a pretty good OST. The only time I can recall them nailing the music with the scene's context was Gojo's ""I alone am the honored one"" scene.

Now, compare this to Ninja Kamui and the usage of the soundtrack, or really the lack of it, is a night and day difference to how effective it makes a fight scene. Being able to hear the impact of every last hit and movement that could be, or is a fatal blow is so much more effective to selling the hell out of a fight and making it that much more engaging. Also just want to say this isn't at all a new thing either. Some of the best fights just know the subtle art of just being quiet. Naruto is a master class of this.

And of course it all comes down to the genre, difference in tone, and viewer preference (for example I think the MHA's OST absolutely make the fights in that anime that much more incredible), but I think the comparison and critique between these two are fairly apt in that both anime are in that same ""bloody fight fest with good visuals"" market.

Any JJK fans that have HBO Max, I highly recommend giving this first episode a watch. Seems to be really promising, albeit a pretty basic plot setup.",False,anime,1707718476.0,1aotbym

"According to this isekai/fantasy world classification, any prime example pip up for each category?",Discussion,"https://i.redd.it/lnzs69jpe2ic1.jpeg


It's chart for isekai person rescue urgency but I decide to add to use for fantasy world as well.

I'll start.



Fairytale world:

- Konosuba (watch S1) Kazuma's adventures tone make me feel like everything's easy and not so serious.

- Farming in another world (anime): gotta keep the harem expanding



Heroic world:

- SAO (Ln) Aincrad world

- Slime (S3) seems like threat are very small to Tempest with Rimuru around (i think if you
remove Rimuru, Tempest would be Glided world)

- Dr.Stone (S3 part 1) The threat are just world ending phenomenon, other seem not too bad.



Noblebright world:

- Mushoku tensei (Ln reader); pretty much standard medieval time or our world + magic.

- Frieren (manga) should be here or near borderline Glided world.

- Solo leveling (Manhwa): could be glided world if not based on world modern world.

- Code geass??



Glided world:

- AoT: Pretty much prime example of Gilded world

- The Eminence in shadow (Ln): imagine being an average guy, isekaied to be an average man there. Diablo shit, the cult, shadow garden raid and wrecking havoc.

- Berserk (Manga): Also borderline Grimdark world, if u happen to be in the crossfire city. 

- Overlord (S4): The world itself seem Glided to me but if u got isekai to Nazaric's enemy is pretty much Grimdark for you.

- Re:Zero (S2)

- Shield Hero (S2)



Grimdark world: no idea, i haven't watch too many dark fantasy anime.

Announcing the First Ever /r/anime Trivia Contest!,*Live* event on Saturday!,"Welcome back to another edition of the /r/anime Sweet 16/9mil/Awards Extravaganza! I'm excited to announce this particular event because I think it's pretty ambitious and unlike anything that we've really done before.

Sometimes I wonder, why does the anime community put so much effort into recording their watching activity? Out of other communities based around media, I feel like we're the ones that can choose from like twenty different tracking sites—as well as the ones who memorize obscure background songs to get the upper hand. Then it occurred to me, we must love random minutia! Why else would we meticulously score and categorize what we've seen, making it almost a hobby into itself?! We're simply building up trivia knowledge! (Please forgive the overwrought entirely transparent attempt at a lead-in intro).

What clan does Megumin belong to? Why is Mune Oomune's name a pun? Just how many Super Saiyan forms are there?! Come join us to answer these questions and more, and **win a fabulous prize!** 

#Participation Details

The trivia contest will be hosted 6 days from now, on **February 17th, 2024 at 1200 PM Central Time, 1800 UTC**. This will be a **live** event! We will be using [Blooket](https://www.blooket.com/) in order to deliver questions and process answers, and the entire thing will be streamed [on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/Dr_JWilson). You don't necessarily have to tune into the Twitch stream, but you'll be able to see how you're doing on each question compared to your fellow trivia players, and most importantly... be able to  [**trash talk in chat.**](#trololol).  

&nbsp;

Also, if you couldn't make it into the lobby, we still encourage you to play along—that also goes for people who missed the event entirely and watch the VOD!

Blooket handles up to 300 players, which hopefully is more than enough. It'll be a first-come, first-served basis, and we'll start promptly on time with however many players were able to join. **You must use your Reddit username as your nickname**. This will be used to validate account requirements as well as be the final delivery means for prizes. And of course, **you may not cheat**, either by looking up the answers, discussing the questions with others, or impersonating someone else. Any evidence of this is grounds for immediate disqualification and potentially a ban from the subreddit. Let's keep this clean and fun!

Once again, the trivia contest will be hosted one week from now, on February 17th, 2024 at 1200PM Central Time, 1800 UTC. Another post will go up the day of to remind people to join for a chance to win some great prizes!

#Prizes

How can we afford prizes you ask?

##[We've got Reddit money](https://files.catbox.moe/1vwh05.png). 
[](#shutupandtakemymoney)

The Reddit Community Funds program has afforded us the opportunity to experiment and try new ways to keep the subreddit fun and give back to the community. If this goes well and people have a good time, we hope to do this again!

First place winner, the one who successfully conquers the gauntlet of arcane and mostly useless (sorry) trivia knowledge, will receive a **$100 [Sentai Filmworks](https://www.sentaifilmworks.com/) Gift Card.** You could spend it immediately, but Sentai often has absurd sales, so you could get quite a lot of bang for your buck!

[](#seasonalhype)

Second place runner-up will receive a **year subscription of Crunchyroll Premium**! Crunchyroll has a great catalogue of shows and a number of good pick-ups from season to season. A year subscription is an $80 value that could free that money up for other anime endeavors!

#Eligibility

Now for a bit of disappointing news. Since these prizes are funded through Reddit, there are certain regional restrictions. Namely, in order to be eligible for prizes, you must be a legal resident of **the United States of America, the United Kingdom, or Canada (excluding Quebec)**. You must also meet /r/anime's new account restrictions, namely **be an account older than 8 days and have more than 10 karma**. You must not be banned from /r/anime (duh!) and must be in good standing with the community.

***

That's it! Once again we thank Reddit for giving us this opportunity, and I thank you guys in advance for showing up and having a good time with me. I'll be hosting over at https://twitch.tv/Dr_JWilson on **Saturday, February 17th at 1200 PM Central Time, 1800 UTC**. Whether or not you're one of the lucky (or should I say, skilled?) ones to win a prize, I'm just happy to be hanging out with the community and putting on a fun little event. See you there!",False,anime,1707700754.0,1aoo0w1

Will there be a chess episode in Classroom of the Elite Season 3?,Help,"This is a question I wanted to share because chess and anime is the greatest idea for entertainment, and love chess as much as anime comes to mind. So hopefully this will be a discussion everyone will ponder about. So let's get started. 

If you don't know what Classroom of the Elite is, Classroom of the Elite sets in a senior a high school following with a character by the name of Kiyotaka Ayanokoji. Don't want to try to spoil much of the anime story for those who don't watch it. If you haven't watch it already, I highly recommend you watch as it gets interesting and interesting in every episode.

In an episode of the first season of the anime, Arisu Sakayanagi was playing chess by herself in the school library. She was playing a chess position that seems to be a master game. During the scene, Arisu is holding a chess book while doing a mate in 4. Now that could hint some major things about a chess episode but want to show you some other things about Season 3.

The opening of Classroom of the Elite Season 3 was heavily showing chess pieces and chess notations. It made me think there could be a chess episode in the anime, but it could go hand-in-hand what the opening is entailing. The opening was also showing shogi pieces and playing cards so maybe the animne won't be deliberately be about chess but other board games as well.

Any chill anime recommendation to watch?,What to Watch?,"So as i get older i feel like i'm no longer inventes on those animes that feature tons of action or a force romance. I can withstand the harem situation and maybe some ecchi but just so little.

He gives him a second chance to start from dust on a new world (with some help) and his choice is to be a farmer. That's the plot, the guy makes a town and farms.

I loved it so much bc ther is no unnecesary drama, not much of fight scenes or epic momments that feel too much, not a force romance at all.

**Questions for post series discussion:**

Q1 - What was your favourite aspect of Gintama? Characters? Comedy? All of it?

Q2 - What do you do at the end of the rewatch? Are you busy? Will you save me?

Q3 - Since it took 10 years between the last successful Gintama Rewatch and this one, what is something you'd like to say to either the host or the watchers of the next one in 2034?

Q4A - **FOR FIRST TIMERS** \- When did you realize that this show had an over-arching plot developing alongside all the jokes and which episode was ""The one"" that made you go, ""that's it, I'll watch it 'till the end""?

Q4B - **FOR REWATCHERS** \- How did it feel watching the series with all the previous knowledge of the plot and watch the characters interactions develop?

Q5 - Without taking in consideration the existence of overarching story of Gintama that existence was a secret revealed in later arcs, how would you expect the Gintama to end if Gintama was only 100% toilet humor/slapstick/gag humour and other aspects of low comedy?

Q6A - How would you murder your rewatch host?

Q6B - What's your favourite shitpost from the show or rewatch?

Q7 - Are there any other rewatches you will be joining?

Q8 - What character did you change your opinion on the most over the course of the series and how?

Q9 - Did any of the many anime references in Gintama made you more interested in watching the referenced show?

Q10 - Gintama has a unique form of storytelling, where there is alot of episodic, unconnected episodes, with the serious arcs sprinkled in between. its not until later where we get more serious arc instead of episodic, comedy and meta episodes. So overall did this format work for you? Did the comedy always land? and was it ever a chore to get through?

Q11 - Did you have a favorite running gag? If so, what was it?

"What Have You Watched This Past Week That is NOT a Currently Airing Show? [February 11th, 2024]",Weekly,"Title says it all - talk about the anime you watched this past week that are not a part of this Winter 2024 season (like **Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun 2nd Stage** or **Dungeon Meshi**), or a show that's continuing from previous seasons (like **Sousou no Frieren**).

With regards to Fall 2023 shows, however, it would be fine to write about them as long as you only began them after they finished airing. For example, it's fine to talk about watching **The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You** or **Arknights: Perish in Frost** if you started them after the final episode aired. Obviously, use your best judgement on this.

**Please use spoiler tags**; it's super simple stuff. An example below:

What anime would make the BEST IRL adaptation?,Discussion,"A few days ago I made a post asking what would make the worst/most hilarious live adaptation, but a lot of people said that most if not all anime would be pretty bad.

Would you rather a second season we never get or one you wish we never got...,Discussion,"I'd say take a shot every time the list of the most anticipated anime of a new season is dominated by sequels, but that's really just a reminder to feed into my alcoholism every three months.

The last few years has admittedly been a pretty good time to be a fan of older series, with many once dormant series coming back with new sequels, spinoffs, or remakes (*Full Metal Panic, Kimi ni Todoke, Fruits Basket, Spice and Wolf, Blue Exorcist, Trigun, Urusei Yatsura*, etc.). Us fans rejoice over these announcements with the hope that we can relive those warm nostalgic memories and use it as a spring board for new fans to pick up the series we love, but it really isn't all sunshine and rainbows? Sure, we all have our *Land of the Lustrous*' and *No Game No Life*'s that make us go ""man, it sure sucks that they never got a second season"" but we also have our *The Devil is a Part-timer*'s and *One Punch Man*'s that make us go ""*man*, it sure sucks that we never got a second season"".

Let's be real here. There's nothing worse than a sucky sequel, and history is peppered with franchises that were the talk of the town before an underwhelming to outright bad sequel came to take the wind out of their sales. In probably the most prominent example, *The Promised Neverland* used to be *the* rising Shounen title before that second season made it the laughing stock of the community. 

So that brings us to the question at hand. Would you rather a series never get that sequel you always wanted or for that sequel to come and ruin everything? Would you rather your lasting memory of a show be that of a fun time that just never had the time to get off the ground or a recommendation that you always have to plop an asterisk and a joke about a non-existent second season next to? Lastly to generalize, can a sequel be so bad that it retroactively affects your enjoyment of that first season? When, for an applicably unfinished series, is it better for the legacy of that series to end it after one season instead of chancing a second?",False,anime,1707676591.0,1aoeyn6

Here are some examples of quite different from each other shows where is about just right ""comedy amount"" that I want : One punch man, The Eminence in Shadow, Kill la Kill, Hinamatsuri, FLCL. Some things that come close: Overlord - with tiny bit more of comedy, Konosuba - with tiny bit more seriousness in plot, MASHLE - first season was kinda ok, might check second one when it will be out.

Anime recommendations for a newbie who does not like stereotypical anime-like women,What to Watch?,"  Hey everyone! In late October 2023, I started my adventure with anime. Before that, I'd seen only a few animated, Japanese movies. I really like animated stuff and want much more recommendations for the following years; however, there is one thing I can't stand in anime - stereotypical anime women.  
So, the anime I am looking for should:

* have as few anime girls as possible (normal female characters are more than welcome),
* be the least sexist possible (Steins;gate was too much for me),
* have as few ""male gaze"" scenes as possible. If I want to watch boobs, asses or legs, I can go outside or visit xvideos,
* tell engaging, interesting, emotional stories,
* follow the quality over quantity principle,
* bonus points for: fantasy/science fiction, gore, mature themes, depressing or anxiety-inducing scenes,
* a special bonus for it being seinen genre (do you even call it a genre) - I don't like stories that are too childish.

What I have already seen (besides movies):

* Death Note - 7/10 (quality dropped af after the 2/3 of the anime)
* Berserk 1997 - 9+/10 (almost perfect; I'll be reading manga soon)
* Vinland Saga - 8/10
* Steins;gate - 7/10 (was really emotional but too animesque and I really hated the way they treated women characters)
* Neon Genesis Evangelion - 6/10 (I get the metaphors, but again, the female characters were meh and it was too odd)
* Darker Than Black - 6/10 (villain of the week story didn't feel right, and it had a lot of wasted potential)
* Serial Experiments Lain - 9/10 (awesome philosophical, cyberpunk anime, loved it)
* Erased - 9/10 (it was like this American novel ""Boy's Life"" by Robert McCammon, a bit dumb but nostalgic and emotional)

Also, I've seen thousands of mainstream films. As I am about to finish my film knowledge studies, I already have a bachelor's. I know a lot about film, so I like to enjoy the technical and narrative sides of anime as well, even if the story lacks something. :)  
Thank you for all the recommendations, and have a nice day or night!  ",False,anime,1707667473.0,1aobbn5

Need Help Remembering an Anime Music Video,Help,"Hey guys. I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this but I'll ask anyway.

I remember an anime-style music video similar to the concept of a whisker away. When the trailer for A Whisker Away came up I remembered that video but no matter how hard I tried I could not find it. 

This is what I remember but it could be different since it was a while back. There was a cat who was in love with a boy who was kind to her. She asked the kami-sama to let her be a human to be with the boy. She was eventually made into a girl but she was not allowed to touch the boy. The boy eventually almost got into an accident but was saved by the girl (cat), where she eventually turned into a cat again in front of the boy.

Greatly appreciate it if someone could help me with this one. It's been on and off in my mind since 2020 and I just want answers. Thank you Redditors.

86 is the first anime I've gotten into for a while,Discussion,"Really great show.  Just the right amount of action, character and world building.   Maybe it's because it's been a while since I watched anime (I go through phases of complete burnout on the medium/genre whatever after a while) but after finishing both seasons I can say it's a really solid show.  I'm surprised I don't hear more about it.  Maybe I just missed its point in the spotlight and don't know.  

I did watch the dub, which I know is a sin to some people but it was really good and I'm also upset to hear the VA for Shin passed away from cancer at 35.  That's really sad.  RIP dude.

Did this show get a lot of attention when it aired?  I don't think i was watching a lot of shows at the time and may have just missed it.  It's better than anything new I've tried to watch.",False,anime,1707664083.0,1aoa10s

"Lu Over The Wall (2017) is underrated, imo.",Discussion,"I just saw it today and I really liked it. I'd like to start with its negatives: although I like how fast-paced it was, at times it was teetering to chaotic. The story overall wasn't that particularly amazing, you could say it was just simple, nothing deep, life-changing, or compelling. There were also some several plotholes and stuff. The ending felt really too abrupt. Many of the characters, although I liked some of them, were ultimately just meh. I wanted more stuff about the mer-people but the movie was being quite scant about it.

Despite those, I did not regret watching it at all. The animation style is really dynamic and funky. I really like the dream-like/surreal and childish animation sequences. The first few minutes made me think the animation was gonna be ""slice-of-lifey"" but no, it was actually quite cartoony. The characters would move animatedly and expressively. The use of colors were pleasing to the eyes. I also liked its comedy. The soundtracks were really good, energetic, lively, and in some parts, beautiful (like that scene with the grandpa near the end, you'll know what I meant after you watch it). I also really liked the transition into its title card.

Overall, I think it's a movie that despite its destination and flaws, you might enjoy the journey like I did. It's been a while since an anime movie made me feel this awed and captivated like a child.

If I were to list what I disliked about it the most it would be (1) those plotholes about the missing people, (2) the lore of the curse, and (3) the abrupt and bittersweet ending, which personally felt it had more bitter than sweet. Although I guess I should've expected that sort of ending from the director of ""Devilman Crybaby"" and ""Ride your Wave"" T T",False,anime,1707652824.0,1ao6evd

Can you help me find what anime includes this episode storyline?,Help,"Apologies in advance if this is not the appropriate forum but recently an anime episode I remember watching months ago popped into my head. It involved a cult/religious order that is based on a sham and the leaders delusions/brain injury.  I believe a young woman seeks out help or the main characters decide to step in and get to the bottom of whats going on with her to help her understand what happened to her mom who was one of the founders of the group. Those who are part of this group all wear white and I remember gold or a gold necklace being involved and the significance of the sun.  It wasn’t a long episode arc, but for the life of me I can’t remember what anime this is from.  I think it’s discovered that the leader or someone from the group killed the mom and he is arrested or detained at the end? Thanks!",False,anime,1707648091.0,1ao5832

Older anime fans: what is the biggest difference between the anime community now compared to when you were young?,Discussion,"For me I'd say it's the modern devotion to seasonal anime.

I got into anime in the 2000s, and I don't think I'd heard the term ""seasonal anime"" until the mid 2010's. In the 2000s I only knew about a new anime when a licensor or fansub group told me it existed, and from my perspective it wasn't happening in well-defined seasons.

In retrospect it's clear that if anime came out in Japan seasonally then the localizations must have been seasonal-with-lag, but it wasn't being marketed in that context. A new anime was just a mysterious product put in front of my face whenever a distributor felt like it.

The closest thing to a ""seasonal"" anime was any random anime airing on TV. Like, new episodes of Bleach every Tuesday at midnight, after Futurama and Robot Chicken. New episodes of Chrno Crusade on this random premium cable channel I didn't know showed anime.

If a fansub group uploaded a new anime weekly I didn't think of it in terms of seasons. It was just a group of people sharing something they liked.

So since there were no seasons for online anime or DVD/VHS, there was no communal expectation to keep with with the latest shows. You would just watch whatever interested you and then seek out discussion groups of people who liked the same anime.

Nowadays I hear people talking about watching seasonal anime they don't even like, because keeping up with seasonals is a core part of anime community discourse. And all the big anime YouTubers make seasonal recap videos.

It's kind of amazing how the Western anime marketing teams have trained people to want to watch more anime by promoting their seasonal nature.",False,anime,1707641434.0,1ao3mtl

Whats your opinion on SWORD ART ONLINE?,Discussion,"Sword Art Online is infamous and hated in the anime community. But personally(not that my opinion matters), though it had many (countless I must say) trashy issues like character development and bla2 stuffss, it was a very engaging watch specially the AINCARD ARC and the latter half of the show.l won't say it is very good or anything like that but at least the concept and all (especially the concept of A.I development from player experiences) was intriguing. What are your thoughts? .. And there is this people who without even watching the series more than one or two episodes talking as if they had finished even reading the manga and LN... LOL.. 

Plus the progressive movies are pretty good too for it fixes some of the pacing and character development issues..Personally it felt like the movies did some justice to the premise..

I just sat down to watch the Anime for 100 Girlfriends on Crunchyroll, and I could only get through half of episode 2 before I had to stop due to the translation choices. I hate to make such a big deal out of something that is meant to be for entertainment and enjoyment, but the slang and phrases used REALLY take me out of the show.

My question then is, are there better translations out there, fan or otherwise? If not, would waiting for a Blu-ray release yield a different translation, or are the Crunchyroll translations used there too?  Again sorry for being this kind of person, I never thought I would be, but I have been so excited about this getting an anime and it is really bumming me out.

Do you feel emotionally connected to Frieren?,Discussion,"It’s an anime I enjoy plenty just like the rest of you. There is no denying it is incredibly made. The folks at Madhouse spared no expense in delivering a quality production. Evan (the goat) Call once again treats our ears with his composing. The vibes are nice and “chill” as one would describe, as well as melancholic. 

The main cast is likable and fun, but I have yet to say that I actually connect to them as  characters. And it’s hard to explain why that is.
I’m not sure if it’s simply the structure of the show being more on the slice of life side, or the fact that our trio has already gone through character development with either in flashbacks or off screen all together. 

There isn’t really much of stakes in universe yet. No one that can pose a challenge to the God that is Frieren, other than the spell granter who we’ve only seen very little of.

Dubbed anime to watch that don't require 100% of my concentration.,What to Watch?,"This might be kind of an odd request.

The only dubbed anime I have watched (besides like Pokémon or Yugioh when I was very young) was Yu Yu Hakusho. And while I do enjoy it very much, I have already re-watched it a few times over the years.

There’s two scenes I remember.  One is this brunette girl staring out of this barred window and when she reaches up to touch they bars they shock/cut her and she looks down at her bloody palm.

Another was a guy I always assumed to be the villain.  I remember him walking around as this scrawny guy and when he’s about to fight he whips off his shirt, starts yelling and flexing, and suddenly gets completely yoked.

Recs for getting back into anime,What to Watch?,"I used to be really into anime, I'd watch something (usually multiple somethings) everyday after school. But over college I got depressed and basically over the last 4-5 years ish I stopped doing pretty much everything I enjoyed including watching anime.

I tend to prefer interesting sports anime or something that's thematically deep (? idk how to describe it). I've watched Naruto and HxH and loved them and tried to get into BNHA but I just didn't care even though friends said I'd love it especially since I'm into DC/Marvel comics stuff. I just couldn't get invested. I think my tastes have moved on from shonen.

The anime that still stick with me are things like Baby Steps, Haikyuu, Daiya no Ace, Run with the Wind, Ping Pong the Animation, March comes in like a Lion, Masterful Cat, Natsume Yuujincho, Seirei no Moribito, Kemono no Souja.

Have you ever had suicidal thoughts before? If so, how do you deal with them?

What do you make of the decision in this episode to not at all be about the mystery of who is Shonen Bat?

She hasn't seen any before, but enjoys Avatar: the last airbender very much. Is there any other like that one? At worst I can fall back in a Ghibli film, but those are really kibd of their own genre and I dont want to deceive her like all anime is like that. Thanks for helping!

She likes ATLA, Percy Jackson, plays, theater shows, finer art type stuff, historical pieces

Can you recommend me shows like “The Apothecary Diaries” but with slightly more romance?,What to Watch?,"Currently watching the show and I am adoring it! I really like the playful flirty relationship between Jinshi and Maomao). I’m looking for a similar vibe in an anime but is slightly more romantic and an actual slow burn with the main characters. Not sure if these two will actually end up together. I also liked how there is a large focus on story outside of their relationship so I’m wanting a show that has a combination of slow burn romance not as the main focus and an actual story outside of it. I do love the Sherlock mystery vibe and the art style as well along with the mixture of seriousness and comedy.

What are you guys favorite SHAFT works?,Discussion,"Just wanted to have a discussion on the studio itself as lately I've been fascinated with their works as I recall like it was yesterday when I saw Madoka Madoka fansubbed in 2011, and while all I saw to this day was the original series, it was fascinating for its surprisingly dark nature as what started off a typical moe type anime got subverted hard after a certain point.

&#x200B;

Secondly I've noticed how their works can be a bit trippy at times as sometimes anime viewers in the USA for instance will say that the studio's works are done with copious amounts of LSD, but I don't know if that's true as drug usage is often prohibited in Japan, but to me it's fascinating how surreal the studio's works are though as yeah they can be trippy at times such as their adaptation of Monogatari itself.",False,anime,1707589112.0,1anmlz7

I'd like to stop pirating anime. What streaming sites deserve my money?,Help,"I've been watching anime for 10 years and never spent a single dime on it. I'm financially stable now so I figure i should start putting money back into my favorite pasttime instead of just leeching. But various official anime streaming sites have reputations for poor video players, or bad comment sections, or bad pricing, or simply taking too much cut of the revenue and not sending enough money back to the studios that make the shows. What sites really DESERVE my money? Or should I just contribute to one of those animator charity things instead of going thru the corporate layer?

Looking for anime to watch,What to Watch?,"So basically im looking for high school anime to watch that is released before 2023. Im in my highschool phase. romance where the male character is really good looking like kakeru from glasslip is a plus. Or any romance anime where boy is lonely at first. I also dont mind dark psychological highschool animes like tomodachi game and another. 

Also i need help finding the anime ive been looking for. I suddenly dreamt it in my dream and felt like rewatching but i forgot the title. But i remember clearly 10 secs of the first episode and the main character. It starts off in the night. And then there is the main character who stands in the middle of something in the night. He has white greyish hair, blue jacket and a red scarf. Then his power has something to do with the scarf and there is blue flames. He looks like atsushi from bungo stray dogs except blue jacket and red scarf and probably whiter hair. 

Also theres another anime i want to remember. I think the male mc met the female mc in a game as their avatars. In real life, they are playing a game at separate places. And then they met in the real world and went to some academy? Their avatars look like chibis. Thank you!",False,anime,1707588001.0,1anm6o9

But hey, queens deserve their crowns too, right?

## Hold My Sake, Boys, It’s the Girls’ Turn to Slay in Jujutsu Kaisen!

**Step aside, Gojo Satoru, it’s the girls’ turn to slay!** This week, we’re ranking the hottest Jujutsu Kaisen characters, from Nobara Kugisaki’s peculiar yet cool power to Maki Zenin’s stoic beauty. We’ll also dive into the enigmatic allure of Mei Mei, the sunshiney charm of Kasumi Miwa, and the hidden depths of Utahime Iori. So grab your sake and get ready to swoon, because these [Jujutsu Kaisen girls](https://www.yualexius.com/2024/02/hottest-jujutsu-kaisen-girls.html) are about to steal the show!

&#x200B;

**Leading the pack is Kugisaki Nobara**

Nobara isn’t just about the looks (though let’s be real, that ginger-brown hair and those sharp eyes are killer). This girl’s got the power to back up her sass. Straw dolls dancing at her command? Check. Cursing curses with a flick of her wrist? Double check. And don’t even get me started on her iconic “[straw doll technique of resonance](https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Straw_Doll_Technique#:~:text=Using%20Resonance%2C%20the%20user%20can,target%20to%20establish%20a%20connection.).” Nobara’s a force to be reckoned with, both on the battlefield and in the style department.

Need help finding an Anime about a spirit/psychic detective?,Help,"Hello, I only remember small pieces but I think the anime is from 2010 - 2020

It's an spirit/psychic detective who is a genius highschool kid. he's OP but he has poor health, so a highschool girl helps him solve these spiritual/psychic phenomenon's.

I remember there being an episode about a poltergeist and it getting completely out of hand and in the final episode he lets out a giant pyschic blade and faints?   


I am so sorry for the description but this is all I can remember.

The boy had blue hair and I think the girl had pink? I don't remember.

Anime to have dialogues/way of speaking that feel natural to natives,Help,"Hi, I'm planning to learn Japanese with lessons, etc. but meanwhile, I'll continue watching anime, and I know that I keep understanding what I'm hearing more and more every day while learning it. However, I'm kind of concerned if the anime I'll be watching consists of unnatural conversations and monologues. Like the ones that a native speaker would react to as ""We don't say such a sentence in our daily life/a situation like this"".

Nay are animes i didnt finished and don't feel like watching till the end for now.

The ones i loved: Death note(strong mc and antagonist), Demon slayer(s1 only since it got very dark in the forest), Chain saw man(loved the animation and there was alot of things happening), **Don't want magic,** Promise in neverland was also very dark, Yu Yu hakusho has a great story and had a fresh feeling, Alice in borderland(everyone go missing), Mob psycho(loved the animation and build up), Vinland saga(only s1, s2 was slow)

edit:

i have seen smart ass anime like todomachi game and death note and code geass and classroom of elite and some with moral dilemma like aot(genocide justified or not) where each one of us made a decision who we side with. Promise in neverland had a dark side and chase(loved it). And anime like phsyco pass s1 that had good sci-fi plus philosophy.

Why did Falco have a dream about flying with swords in aot?,Discussion,I could be misremembering this but didn’t he mention a day dream of him flying with swords? Did that ever get an actual explanation bc no matter what I come up with I can’t see how he could have seen anything related to odm gear and being a scout with no past memories bc he wasn’t a titan yet. Was this just a “look how far we’ve come from fighting titans to where we’re at now” thing as a nod to viewers or what?

"When did the trend of ""redeeming the villainess"" get its start?",Discussion,"I know the more technical term is ""otome villainess"" but those tend to be specifically series where the protagonist is reincarnated as the villainess, while the trend I'm talking about is that plus series like *I'm in Love with the Villainess* and *Trapped in a Dating Sim*, where the villainess is a separate character from the protagonist but is shown in a more sympathetic light and that they're not truly that bad of a person.

I'm sure that technically these types of stories have always been around, but kind of like how kids fighting the death in arenas was a thing before *Hunger Games* but *Hunger Games* was the thing that every story after was trying to mimic the success of, given the increase in these types of villainess stories in anime (and assumedly light novels too) over the years I feel like there has to be a common denominator of some kind. Some story that really did something eye-catching with its villainess/villainess protagonist, or even some point in the media landscape where people started to feel the stock villainess character was being really underwritten or maybe even didn't deserve a lot of the terrible things they had happen to them in the standard stories.",False,anime,1707542293.0,1an8rzm

Gunslinger Girl and Confronting the Posthuman,Writing,"When you think about the technology of the future, it’s hard not to feel a little excited about what’s coming. Reinforcing your limbs with an exoskeleton or accessing the Internet from your mind sounds empowering and convenient. And *Cyberpunk Edgerunners* last year was very cool too. But I don’t think anime is as excited as we are about that premise. Between the debilitating side effects of cybernetic enhancements in *Cyberpunk Edgerunners* and the fears of an AI uprising in *Vivy: Fluorite Eye’s Song*, we’re actually really afraid. There’s an overwhelming sense of concern in making that leap into the future - of abandoning humanity and embracing technology. What does it mean to step into the world of robotics and AI? What does it mean to move to the next stage after humans?

##What is posthumanism?

Posthumanism is far above my anime-addled mind’s capabilities to fully dive into within 3000 words. But in a general sense, posthumanism is a philosophy about challenging the definition of humans and human-centric mindsets. It’s an evolution of Humanism, a perspective that places [humanity at the top of everything else](https://imgur.com/mj1qWII.png). Posthumanism challenges that superiority by asking what separates a human and an android. Is a [person with prosthetic arms](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*6HgGbD6tbRSk-2TZWYGBIw.jpeg) still human? Is [an organic brain in a metal body](https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/ghost-in-the-shell-artwork.png?width=1200&height=630&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp) still human? Are [apes with 90% shared DNA human](https://i0.wp.com/news.qoo-app.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/11/17110808171769.jpeg)? This philosophical framework argues that, as technology rapidly advances, we need to do away with these definitions, break down these identity-based borders, and accept that “humanity” as we know it will and has fundamentally changed. Alongside this breakdown of boundaries, the destruction of taxonomies and other hierarchies is also core to posthumanism’s tenets of unifying all types of people.

This again is a bit of a gross oversimplification of posthumanism, but what I want to highlight about posthumanism and *Gunslinger Girl* is how we struggle with that transformation. We’ve all grown up with humans as the center of everything, and we have no idea what posthumans are because they have steadily crept up on us in the form of pacemakers or prosthetics. And sci-fi anime covering this topic emphasize that challenge to acknowledge this change in our society and thinking. Its characters grapple with their acceptance of cyborgs and AI, showing how we desperately cling to anthropocentrism. AI today is an incredibly controversial topic - are we willing to treat an AI the same way we treat our friends and family? Gunslinger Girl captures this anxiety, and shows the resulting brutality in its marginalization of the cyborgs. 

##Gunslinger Girl

*Spoilers for Season 1*

*Gunslinger Girl* sits in an interesting spot among science fiction anime. The story follows agents of Italy’s [Social Welfare Agency \(SWA\)](https://imgur.com/xQZuY59.png), a government-sponsored institution that provides rehabilitation services for [critically](https://imgur.com/77CQrMq.png) [injured](https://imgur.com/zoQKm2r.png) children. But it’s actually a front for a [counter-terrorism unit](https://imgur.com/2qVDtSA.png) that employs human, adult men handlers partnered with [brainwashed](https://imgur.com/AdWKmnN.png), [cybernetic girls](https://imgur.com/aQUxzAB.png) to [assassinate](https://imgur.com/Qp5fukI.png) everyone from bomb makers to political dissidents. *Gunslinger Girl* is set in modern (modern being early 2000s, same time as when the manga began publishing) Italy, where technology is advanced but not cyberpunk advanced. The cyborgs are noticeably anachronistic relative to the [other technology depicted](https://imgur.com/yTHC8RJ.png), but that only further emphasizes how novel posthumans are to the human cast members. 

These girls, who are either in [desperate situations medically or have been abandoned by their families](https://imgur.com/tvT7a55.png), undergo a procedure called “[conditioning](https://imgur.com/yVPp5PM.png),” that transforms them into cyborgs with [superhuman strength](https://imgur.com/t72aAIQ.png) and [reflexes](https://imgur.com/QXYAI7d.png). Conditioning has some drawbacks though: the first is that this process and subsequent procedures [shorten the lifespan of the patient](https://imgur.com/NXWDOIb.png). Another is that oftentimes the girls are programmed to possess an [unwavering loyalty towards their handlers](https://imgur.com/fNcBDUJ.png), to the point of [injuring innocent people](https://imgur.com/Af8n3g9.png) because they vaguely [point a knife](https://imgur.com/hTblAol.png) in their [handler’s direction](https://imgur.com/YSOpqd9.png). Lastly, the conditioning also wears away at their mental faculties, like [dementia](https://imgur.com/Y1RvSB6.png). The girls are paired with an adult male and form a unit called a fratello (Italian for sibling). The man is called a “handler,” and he gets to name his new [cyborg](https://imgur.com/NOOBY8j.png) and [teach her how to operate as an killer](https://imgur.com/0ry4epK.png). After injuries during missions, the girls are constantly re-conditioned at varying levels, further wearing down their lifespans and memories in order to squeeze out additional combat usefulness.

Season 1 focuses on the introduction of these girls and their relationships with their handlers. Despite being conditioned surgically to be loyal [tools for assassination](https://imgur.com/LnkP6zL.png), they’re in many ways undeniably human. They cry. They bleed. They love. But their assassinations are uncanny, and that discrepancy makes it difficult for everyone else to treat them as human. Their handlers are older men who are generally ostracized or isolated from the rest of society for various reasons. As a result, their main social interactions come from one another and their cybernetic charges. These men are forced to [confront the posthuman](https://imgur.com/UNqdPTq.png), and how they react says a lot about what makes posthumanism so challenging to embrace.

##Cyborgs as tools

Each fratello has a story to tell about posthumanism. But none are quite as traditional as [Jean and Rico](https://imgur.com/bWlD0Hj.png). As a handler, Jean is *the* strict professional. He truly embodies the us vs. them mentality suggested by humanism. Jean sees his cyborg, Rico, and the others as [nothing more than tools](https://imgur.com/HCDg2DX.png). He even goes as far as to give his cyborg a [boy’s name](https://imgur.com/xbyOTOp.png), denying her gender identity and creating emotional distance. However, Rico has no concern over her treatment or new lifestyle. Because she retained her memories in spite of the conditioning, she only sees the improvements from her previous life and [finds the tradeoffs worthwhile](https://imgur.com/646m13Z.png). As a result, she is the most obedient of the group, readily sacrificing [her own](https://imgur.com/ucG0QyH.png) [happiness](https://imgur.com/OKsvopI.png) for [the sake of Jean and the SWA](https://imgur.com/hzMm3Dj.png). Even as Rico steadily begins to show more interest in other things like [love](https://imgur.com/vOppcQF.png), Jean is quick to shut down any attempts for Rico to indulge herself. At some point, [Rico expresses her fear of death](https://imgur.com/GuOAr1U.png), but even that desire for life is [denied](https://imgur.com/GwV9j0f.png) [by Jean](https://imgur.com/SW30iHE.png). [Cyborgs are meant to die for their handlers](https://imgur.com/HhRF7Dj.png). 

This fratello serves as a traditional representative of humanism. Jean prioritizes the handlers and the agency over the cyborgs. He goes out of his way to reject the cyborgs’ desires and makes it clear that they serve humankind. And Rico happily plays the role of the tool, and calmly accepts Jean’s viewpoints. [Even if that means taking physical abuse](https://imgur.com/DJbk2xL.png). That sort of apathy only evokes a sense of [inhumanness](https://imgur.com/p3Mf9MW.png), but her interests in [art](https://imgur.com/XZUmphL.png) and the [meteor shower](https://imgur.com/kpxCK5P.png) reveal her personality buried under the dedication to Jean. Their relationship emphatically argues that this humanistic perspective suppresses the cyborg and denies the posthuman their freedom.

##Cyborgs as strangers

[Marco and Angela](https://imgur.com/n6lUfQU.png) are the first fratello of the SWA. Angela is the original cyborg, and [Marco takes to her immediately](https://imgur.com/UrgzXMT.png). The two form a [close bond](https://imgur.com/0ry4epK.png), thanks to the initial idleness of the SWA. Marco doted on Angela and the latter received an abundance of love from the rest of the agency. However, [his feelings begin to change](https://imgur.com/CpBbgij.png) when Angela begins combat and their relationship falters as the continuous conditioning wears down [Angela’s memory](https://imgur.com/6rM9Tdb.png). Marco becomes [distraught](https://imgur.com/lGQovUe.png) over the impact of Angela’s [conditioning](https://imgur.com/1Nr9Lo5.png) and, believing her to have [changed from their first meeting](https://imgur.com/8p9grVh.png), [grows](https://imgur.com/z8rwJWu.png) [distant](https://imgur.com/7rmKY6q.png). They become [further estranged](https://imgur.com/6ViPbr3.png) as Angela’s attempts to win Marco back [end in repeated failure](https://imgur.com/pnqCyU3.png). Eventually, her time runs out, and [thanks to Henrietta’s insistent efforts](https://imgur.com/TmMbwfq.png), [Marco and Angela](https://imgur.com/81EGtbF.png) are able to share [her final moments together](https://imgur.com/YiZg0ma.png).

In clear opposition to Jean, Marco did not see Angela as a cyborg at first. She was a human just like everybody else. But as Angela further cyberizes, she strays from that initial person Marco knew. Their relationship clearly illustrates how man’s attachment to the cyborg is predicated on how human it appears. As the veneer of the innocent girl fell away, Angela was ostracized. Rico represents cyborgs as a tool. But Angela represents that defined border between humans and posthumans. Angela does everything she can to meet the expectations of Marco and reposition herself in Marco’s good graces. But her actions as a cyborg would never be enough to bridge that divide. When Angela is hospitalized, Marco actually seeks to repair their relationship, but those efforts could also be interpreted as an affirmation of his loyalty to the Angela before all the conditioning. Marco is seen [hunting for the dog](https://imgur.com/hXYS52d.png) she used to own in her life prior to the SWA. Marco is still thinking about the human Angela [instead of spending more of his time with cyborg Angela](https://imgur.com/5frgw9T.png). Even at her deathbed, he still didn’t want this stranger wearing Angela’s skin.

##Cyborgs as humans

[Claes and Ravallo](https://imgur.com/vZGTRWz.png) are only together for a single episode, which serves as an origin story for Claes. She’s the one cyborg that mysteriously stays at the agency without a handler. In a flashback, Ravallo is shown joining the SWA as a favor for Jean. He ends up building a close bond with his cyborg, Claes. Despite being told to treat her as a tool, Ravallo can’t help but learn more about [Claes’ past](https://imgur.com/a8Sx316.png), going so far as to use [her original name](https://imgur.com/xh2KE9B.png) [instead of a new one](https://imgur.com/wqjPPkB.png). They bond over [fishing](https://imgur.com/VGVoJjF.png) and [books](https://imgur.com/G860DM8.png), and Ravallo [treats her as a human](https://imgur.com/la6PZNt.png). But after a disagreement between Jose and Ravallo turns into an almost fatal shootout between [Henrietta](https://imgur.com/XkzCaGJ.png) and [Claes](https://imgur.com/MhFH1r7.png), Ravallo attempts to [expose](https://imgur.com/kXqfo1Q.png) [the SWA](https://imgur.com/YzWErBA.png). As a result, it is heavily implied that [he was assassinated](https://imgur.com/OtijTXm.png), and [Claes becomes unable to operate](https://imgur.com/ZU0OT08.png) or [even remember Ravallo](https://imgur.com/kDrjj6h.png), due to the mental toll of losing her handler. 

This episode covers a gradual development in Ravallo’s perspective on cyborgs. It starts with the [distaste](https://imgur.com/3NHOokw.png) Ravallo feels towards the program and Claes, and ends with him [feeling disgust towards himself](https://imgur.com/9d7MNJo.png) for supporting this system. [His last words to Claes are not only a plea to choose compassion over violence](https://imgur.com/muilBv7.png), but also [a request instead of an order](https://imgur.com/oWAZ63j.png). Ravallo rejects the SWA, and even attempts to return agency to Claes. [He goes as far as to return Claes’ original glasses](https://imgur.com/oPjkaiE.png), something only the human Claes wore prior to the SWA. In many ways, this change in relationship is the philosophy posthumanists extol. Ravallo fights against the government’s intentions to use these girls as weapons. But it falls short of the grander philosophy which is about decentralizing humans. Ravallo wants Claes to return to being a young girl - the way he clings to her original name and her glasses reveals that [he did not care for the cyborg](https://imgur.com/VL0tICQ.png) but for the human Claes once was. And Claes had never even asked to return to her former life. She would’ve been happy continuing to work by Ravallo’s side. Ravallo’s last actions are kind, but also a clear refutation of cyborgs in favor of humans.

So if being too compassionate to your cyborg is not posthumanism, and treating your cyborg as a weapon is not posthumanism, what is? 

##Cyborgs as cyborgs

[Jose \(sometimes spelled Giuse\) and Henrietta are our main pairing](https://imgur.com/Q0HDJr0.png). This fratello occupies a very interesting position in our humanism-posthumanism sliding scale. As such, Jose occupies a middle ground with respect to his feelings towards the cyborgs. He initially chooses Henrietta because of her dire circumstances: her entire family was slaughtered by a serial murderer, and the conditioning of the SWA was her only chance at survival. As a result of her conditioning, [Henrietta falls in love with Jose](https://imgur.com/sH1VwX7.png), but this loyalty also causes her to [go berserk any time he is threatened](https://imgur.com/leajXlE.png). He’s torn between his [guilt for functionally brainwashing a young girl](https://imgur.com/Ayqg5Mk.png) into a tool for murder and his desire for revenge against the terrorists who killed his family. As a result, Jose [spoils Henrietta](https://imgur.com/kDmsKrb.png) [as much as possible](https://imgur.com/JwsNuhy.png), [buying her gifts](https://imgur.com/jYECW6x.png) and [indulging in her requests](https://imgur.com/VTUXa5L.png). As sweet as they are to each other, it’s hard to ignore how Jose is so willing to sacrifice Henrietta in service of his retribution. He’s clearly using her as a tool, like his brother Jean.

However, there’s a turning point for our main duo in episode 11, when [agents from another SWA section](https://imgur.com/Fp0oI9q.png) are investigating the [murder of another fratello](https://imgur.com/PTJ44FT.png). They go to meet Henrietta and Jose because Triela, another cyborg, had advised them that [Jose and Henrietta were the people to see to learn more about fratello relationships](https://imgur.com/6bJTXji.png). The agents observe the [fondness the two have for each other](https://imgur.com/p7hG2Vh.png) and the [inhuman abilities](https://imgur.com/9BuBfsZ.png) of Henrietta in action. And of course those investigators [feel](https://imgur.com/jlEWRT9.png) [disgust](https://imgur.com/Fh1Ii8h.png) over what Henrietta has become and the way Jose uses Henrietta as a shield. But that perception gets flipped on its head. Henrietta ends up [revealing](https://imgur.com/CtN13zs.png) that the murders of the fratello were likely a result of a [murder-suicide](https://imgur.com/DnHZxOY.png): the cyborg killed her handler after realizing her handler will never [love](https://imgur.com/I9cENqC.png) [her](https://imgur.com/5pO3bqc.png) back. How did Henrietta know? It’s what [she would do](https://imgur.com/CRklAso.png) of course! And in a very sane move, Henrietta [pretends to shoot herself](https://imgur.com/myIsaF0.png) to [test](https://imgur.com/Pww3EsP.png) [Jose’s love](https://imgur.com/1Od3FlE.png). To which Jose passes with flying colors. 

The cyborgs are incredibly loyal and it may seem like the handlers take advantage of them. But this balance of power lies on a more precarious tightrope than it appears: handler and cyborg must maintain a form of [symbiosis](https://imgur.com/xX9xFMR.png). All the conditioning in the world is moot if the cyborg deems their fratello a lost cause. Throughout the season, it’s easy to fall into the trap that Jose is [manipulating Henrietta’s emotions](https://imgur.com/ZgudHKv.png) through gifts and outings. They are the most affectionate fratello and in some ways it becomes unsettling how close they are knowing that Henrietta’s love will likely never be returned. [But she understands that](https://imgur.com/ZgudHKv.png). [Jose understands it too](https://imgur.com/GK2iDsz.png). That’s why he says that handlers must be “[someone they can respect](https://imgur.com/P6Ks7xj.png),” not love. You don’t say that if the conditioning makes betrayal an impossibility.

And that’s what makes Henrietta and Jose the relationship closest to the ideals of posthumanism. We’ve set up this patriarchal structure within the fratellos in the previous examples, but with this reveal that cyborgs can kill their handlers, that hierarchy has changed. The power dynamic hasn’t quite equalized completely, [but the dividing line has blurred a bit](https://imgur.com/UpJhtqv.png). There’s a more nuanced give and take going on than what we expected. And that can be attributed to the [cyborgs’ self awareness](https://imgur.com/Rz6uela.png). We’ve viewed these fratello relationships so far based on how their handlers treat their cyborgs. Of course we’re horrified: this is [slavery](https://imgur.com/ZOZJBCV.png). [But the viewer hasn’t been asking how the cyborgs feel](https://imgur.com/7OHaywc.png). And as we’ve seen in every previous fratello, [they accept it](https://imgur.com/SkAaU1M.png). They accept that they’re subservient to a group of men [who see them](https://imgur.com/zC3Edl1.png) as [replaceable](https://imgur.com/jxDX4EB.png). But those circumstances [aren’t a reason to give up on life](https://imgur.com/qZNjyUR.png). Henrietta throughout the season has also been pondering her place in the world. [She’s accepted her fate](https://imgur.com/T1tLpAW.png). The [conditioning is a part of who she is](https://imgur.com/MSYjrWm.png), and [she still finds it meaningful in spite of the evil committed against her](https://imgur.com/Ek4j1Sk.png). 

So much of posthumanism is about challenging the status quo. It’s about embracing multiple subjectivities and the blending of traditional roles whether they are ones of gender, politics, or cyborgs. Henrietta challenges both handlers and viewers to reconsider [how they look](https://imgur.com/sL1xjrg.png) [at the cyborgs](https://imgur.com/s8LKdg0.png). The domination we and Jose thought he had over Henrietta has evolved into a more collaborative relationship that [requires work from both partners](https://imgur.com/4Cg1s3M.png). The gender positions have been reversed in a few capacities, such as how in this show [the women protect the males](https://imgur.com/NbhSXNM.png). The boundary has been broken. Henrietta is [not a girl](https://imgur.com/WIpem89.png). [She is a cyborg](https://imgur.com/N73UuQY.png). The posthuman is here.

##Conclusion

In many ways, *Gunslinger Girl* does not embrace the posthuman. It places prepubescent girls at the mercy of white men, reaffirming the dominant male and submissive female gender and racial roles, and fails to collapse the patriarchal structure of the SWA. But Henrietta and Jose show us the way forward to posthumanism. This fratello takes the first step over this boundary by encouraging us to reevaluate our preconceived and heavily human-centric perspectives. Their relationship isn’t equitable yet, but if you’re willing to see from Henrietta’s eyes, you’ll find that there’s more power and dignity in her position than what you assumed. 

And I don’t think that’s uncommon. Many popular sci-fi works hover at the threshold of posthumanism: they challenge viewers on their assumptions on humanity, and constantly ask them if these posthumans are any different from them. *Star Wars* asks if robots like R2-D2 are human. *Her* asks if AI like Samantha are human. Gunslinger Girl asks if Henrietta is human. We’ll keep saying yes until one day we don’t. And it will not be no because the posthuman isn’t human enough. It will be no because there are no more humans left.",False,anime,1707525714.0,1an3ib8

What is the lowest MAL rating that will make you watch an anime?,Discussion,"While I read reviews and listen to feedbacks from friends, MAL ratings play a huge part in my decision to watch an anime. A good show starts at 7.5, and my threshold is 6.8. Yes I know that MAL ratings might be biased but I still rely on them. What about you?

Edit: Thank you for your takes on this. Just wanted to add that I don't have a lot of time to try out anime and like almost all genres, which is why I look at ratings to choose anime with higher likelihood of me enjoying them. 

If you've watched an anime below 6.8 and genuinely enjoyed it, it'd be nice if you shared it!",False,anime,1707517471.0,1an0gfz

Anime similar to warrior at the borderline?,What to Watch?,"Just watched the first season of this anime and was wondering if there are any anime similar to it. I heard this show getting compared with the likes of code geass and Gundam 00.

What anime never dropped in quality since the first season?,Discussion,"Its easy to find shows that fumble after the first season like TPN or OPM season 2, and so its probably less common to find shows that consistently either stay the same or improve every season. Which anime do not drop in quality though, and preferably two or more seasons but one is fine if it comes to it.

My picks are Mob Psycho 100, Made in Abyss, and FMA:B",False,anime,1707514100.0,1amz67y

Please help me find my childhood anime,Help,"Ok so I really need help finding this anime from my childhood. It was about this blonde haired baby found by a man who already had two small sons and a wife in the woods. The girl had a golden bracelet if I remember correctly. The man took the Girl in and raised her like his own the sons also loved her and treated her well like a family member. The father eventually passed away and left his son's and wife along with the girl behind. The mother grew to hate the girl over time don't even remember why and then the oldest son had to leave and look for a job to support his family. So he left to the city. I don't know what happened to the younger brother but I know that in the meantime as the older brother was gone the mother told the girl that she was actually found and she's not her mother and to stop calling her that. The girl eventually left and idk how but like met this guy who's very rich and all and yea. The older brother eventually returned to be met with his mother and she told him everything making him upset Nd he went looking for her. I completely forgot the rest.

"Is anime too ""flash in the pan"" these days? It feels most shows don't stick after they end or stay popular",Discussion,"Think about how a lot of the anime that people still talk about today are now 20-30 year old anime. Cowboy Bebop, Evangelion, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball, etc. It seems no matter how old these shows are they simply stuck around and transcended generations. Same for ongoing manga shonen like One Piece that are still going.

It feels like most shows from the 2010's are already pretty much forgotten or most people don't talk about them much anymore even the ones that were really popular at the time. I was just thinking how a lot of shows I watched in the last few years or just recently ended are pretty much ""gone like the wind.""

If Madoka wasn't getting a new movie I'd never hear about it again. What happened to Violet Evergarden? The Promised Neverland? Psycho Pass? Kill la Kill? Akame a kill? Angel Beats? Space Dandy?

In a few years time recent stuff like Spy Family and Demon Slayer will probably just become forgotten. Why is it anime does not ""stick"" anymore?",False,anime,1707506198.0,1amw3o9

What anime were heavily hyped and anticipated but turned out to be a disappointment?,Discussion,"Some shows in mind:

1. **Akame Ga Kill** \- This was the first show that came to mind. First half was really great and intense, but then the character deaths and terrible pacing in the second cour tanked the show.
2. **Tokyo Revengers** \- This is the most notable one. I assume all the hype was lost considering how terrible the manga ended, and the MC is unbearable because he always gets his ass whooped, and Disney getting their hands on the anime really screwed up its promotion and marketing.
3. **The Tokyo Mew Mew Reboot** \- I got excited when a reboot was going to be made for the original series in the 2000's. While it was hyped and talked about a lot because of its cute and more colorful polish, the reboot itself unfortunately didn't live up to expectations. It was rather bland and lackluster.
4. I know it's still ongoing, but **Mato Seihei no Slave (Chained Soldier)** is already a mess despite being a very hyped ecchi harem show this season. The sloppy CGI, skipped ""rewards"" scenes from the manga, weird character designs and mediocre background art, the female MC Kyouka's voice doesn't fit her, and the censorship are really a bother. In other words, the studio has already butchered this adaptation.",False,anime,1707504865.0,1amvl1g

recommend me Power Fantasy/OP MC where the other characters knows the MC is strong,What to Watch?,"I'm getting back into anime after a couple years, and I'm just wondering if there's any new-ish animes that have strong or overpowered MC.

but not ones where the world around them for some reason doesn't acknowledge, or doesn't know that hes strong. 

It also doesn't have to be power or magic. For example, he can be really smart, and others acknowledge that.

Anime doesn't make me feel strong emotions. I kinda want it to.,What to Watch?,"So I'm kinda new to watching anime. I've tried in the past but I have a bad habit of losing interest in long shows. So anyway I've seen maybe 10 or 15 anime most if which could be considered sad or had really sad moments. Sword Art Online is the only anime to have ever made me cry (idk why). So I guess I'm looking for something that will really get my emotions going. Whether it be sad or happy I just want to enjoy anime, and most of my enjoyment in movies, and tv shows comes from how attached I get to it. I'd love some recommendations. <3",False,anime,1707494048.0,1amr9h4
"anime appreciation, feeling emotionally drained...",Discussion,"**No spoilers for any shows mentioned here, and appreciate anyone who takes time to read this splat :)**

I decided to start watching anime in December with the goal of watching shows that did not have over sexualised female characters/ too much fan service, this started with the first episode of **Frieren Beyond Journey's End.** I watched all that had aired and I loved it so much that I thought about it all the time, rewatched scenes, repeated full episodes and listened to the music constantly. I also ordered the manga books but I won't read them yet as I want to follow the show first. I am eyeing up a cool (but expensive :( lol) figurine. **I am caught up as far as E18 so not spoilers please** ;)

I then went on to watch **Violet Evergarden** (the series) and this one really left me in an absolute state, I was constantly getting sad thinking about everything and again had to keep rewatching scenes and was totally obsessed with the music. I even ordered some figurines which cost more than I would care to admit lol. The story of this anime is so touching I almost can't think about it. I have seen the final movie but I don't include it amongst my passions.

I was very nervous about my next choice, after watching the previous two I considered taking a break because I worried nothing could meet those standards and emotions, but next came **Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song** and it absolutely blew me away. This one was so interesting, especially when rewatching scenes to actually understand the (at times) complicated plot kept adding more layers and reasons to love the show. This one also got me very emotional too and I love rewatching scenes / listening to the music. Also ordered a figurine, light novel collection and a plush.

Then it was time for **Girls' Last Tour,** this one took an episode or 2 to click but I came to really love this show and the characters - except for what I considered to be a couple of unnecessary depictions. This one didn't have me rewatching scenes/ music as much as the others, but overall I felt that I had watched something really special and it left me feeling like I actually missed the characters. I have now ordered some of the light novels that will hopefully give me a little more of this story. There are some cool little figures available for this one but the sale prices are way too high, maybe one day.

Most recently I watched **Spice And Wolf.** This one almost got turned off in the first episode because I thought it was just going to be some creepy ""oooo cute wolf girl"" gimmick and not much more, but the voice acting (english dub in my case) was so incredible that I had to give it a chance, and after watching a few episodes I could not believe how amazing this show was, and in such good taste. There is such a captivating and complex dynamic between the characters achieved through top class dialog and story telling, these characters could do nothing but walk around chatting all day and I would love watching it. I felt absolutely destroyed when the credits of the last episode rolled knowing there was no more. I was recommended the audio books of the light novels to continue with the story and when I started listening to one I actually teared up just because I was so happy to be back with these characters again. I ordered a little figurine for this one (it was hard to get one that wasn't creepy but I found a nice one) and I will also have copies of the light novels for my collection.

All in all I am emotionally drained by these shows haha, I cannot believe how interesting and beautiful these stories have been, how incredible some of the animation was, how amazing the music was, and how inspired the voice acting was.

I can't wait to watch more anime in future but for now I think I need a break rewatching Sopranos or something, these shows just hit too damn hard :(",False,anime,1707493819.0,1amr6an

[ANNOUNCEMENT] r/anime sings 192: Brand New World (One Piece OP 6),Misc.,"Hello everyone! As much as I was thinking my previous project would be my last one, I’m here once again to announce yet another r/anime sings project! About halfway through last year, I started what quickly became my second favorite anime of all time, one I’m sure we’re all familiar with: One Piece. I was surprised to learn that the only r/anime sings project we’ve done for it so far was *We Are!* in 2017, so I decided it was time I fix that. I put this project up to a vote a month ago, and the winner was quite clear: we’ll be singing OP 6, *Brand New World*. I’m excited for it, since this OP in particular got very little time in the spotlight.

WHAT IF??? (ANIME EDITION),Discussion,"There are a lot of decisions made in anime which are usually amazing. But sometimes they are outright bad like giving plot armor to certain characters, killing off characters way too early, power of friendship/love, or plain one-dimensional characters who never change, etc. Or sometimes you just wanted it to turn out differently even though the original idea was good enough.

So how would you alter elements of the story, and what impact do you think these changes would have on the overall plot?

For example, ever wonder what would have happened if in:

**(SPOILERS AHEAD)**

* \[Dragon Ball\] >!You cannot resurrect someone when they die / Goku kills  Vegeta and several others whenever he has the chance.!<
* \[Death Note\] >!Light manages to win at the end instead of dying / L somehow manages to escape death by outsmarting Light.!<
* \[Naruto\] >!Kurama never turns good / Orochimaru possesses Sasuke as planned / Naruto and Sasuke never get sudden power-ups at the end / Neji doesn't die during the war.!<

Which animes will never be forgotten?,Discussion,"Dragonballz and Pokemon are the first ones to come to my mind. They started it all and still to this day whenever they get new content people get hyped like the sparking zero trailer. Next up are Naruto and One piece obviously. They were the biggest animes in 2000's era and have been a huge cultural phenomenon. I am kinda iffy about Bleach on the other hand. Sure it was part of the big three in the west but during its absence and hatred from the community it heavily declined in popularity. Yes Naruto did also get hate but there are still so many people talking about it as compared to Bleach which isn't anywhere as recognizable as the other two.

Other animes that come to my mind are Yu gi oh and Sailor Moon. However I don't really see people talking about them despite being classics like DBZ. Yu Gi Oh is popular because of its cards not necessarily due to its anime and Sailor Moon isn't even as popular as Bleach in these times.

There can be a case for Jjk and Aot but it depends if they are still being talked about 5 or 6 years later down the line. Aot has ended so it may effect its popularity and Jjk's manga is also closer to its end.

Suggestions based off of likes and dislikes,What to Watch?,"Hi all,

I am for a new anime to watch, and I thought that it would be helpful to provide a list of anime that I enjoyed (and why) and ones I didn’t (and why not). Hopefully these catch your eye off of your own taste! Please only list anime’s that have dubbed versions. I’m not able to follow the subtitles very well. Also, I listed at the bottom a few options that I have heard great things about, so I’d love feedback with those as well!

LIKES

Attack on Titan- my first anime ever. In love with the world building, the politics, and the fast paced storyline that left me guessing!

Code Geass- my most recent watch. Once again, I love the politics, the world building, and fast paced storyline. I also really liked the some of the romantic elements… which I didn’t think that I’d care about lol.

Elfen Lied- full disclosure, I was told to try this one for the tits… certainly didn’t disappoint lol. The story was great, and the gore was just ridiculous but not in a bad way. Def not a favorite, but I would watch it again.

DISLIKES

Death Note- I liked the concept, it was just too slow for me. I found myself getting bored. Also, the character development just wasn’t there for me. Too wordy, not enough action.

Fullmetal Alchemist- to be 100% fair, I’m not sure that I gave this one a sufficient chance. I got through about four or five episodes and just thought “I don’t know why, but I just don’t like this”


Anime that I’m considering

Kill La Kill

Devilman Crybaby 
Demon Slayer

Just found and watched a true hidden gem of 2014: Nobunaga Concerto,Watch This!,"Synopsis:  History classes have never interested Saburo. He never saw the point of learning something that happened in the past, let alone a few hundred years ago. But when he falls off a wall, he travels through a wormhole and ends up in 16th century ancient Japan. He meets a very young Oda Nobunaga, one of the most influential figures in Japanese history, who turns out to be identical in appearance as Saburo. The real Nobunaga, sick of the castle life and wanting to travel, orders Saburo to take his place. Without knowing how to get back to his time, Saburo tries to make sure history isn’t rewritten for the infamous Oda Nobunaga.

&#x200B;

Review:  

The anime may initially deter viewers due to its CGI-like art style, but this aspect quickly becomes inconsequential when compared to the richness of its narrative. The story revolves around Saburo, a disinterested student of history who unexpectedly finds himself thrust into 16th century ancient Japan after a fortuitous fall. Here, he encounters a young Oda Nobunaga, and their striking resemblance leads to Saburo assuming Nobunaga's identity at the latter's behest. What follows is a gripping tale of Saburo's attempts to navigate the intricacies of history while safeguarding its integrity.

With a rating of 9/10, this anime captivates audiences with its compelling characters, witty humor, and exhilarating battle sequences. Moreover, it offers valuable insights into Japan's Sengoku era, cleverly intertwining historical events with imaginative storytelling. While the narrative takes creative liberties with famous historical figures, it maintains enough fidelity to keep it recognizable and engaging. As a fan of time travel narratives, this series stands out as a favorite, delivering an immensely satisfying viewing experience.

However, the disappointment lies in its brevity, spanning only 10 episodes. Thankfully, fans can delve deeper into the intricacies of the story through the extensive manga series, comprising 22 volumes. Anticipation mounts for the release of the final volume, promising closure to this captivating saga. Avoiding spoilers, I wholeheartedly recommend this anime to anyone seeking a blend of history, adventure, and entertainment.",False,anime,1707455423.0,1amgg2l

Fixing Dragon Ball GT's Super 17 Saga,Discussion,"Dragon Ball GT's Super 17 Saga is something even most of its fans won't defend and recommend skipping. Even considering the series run being cut short, I still have no idea what anybody was thinking with this arc. We have a bunch of past villains escaping Hell, which is just used as a backdrop for an arc where Android 17 turns evil and fuses with a copy of himself that was somehow built in Hell. Why Dr. Gero and Dr. Myuu aren't bothering with enhancing Cell or Rildo, their creations who defeated Goku, and the latter still being loyal, is anybody's guess.

&#x200B;

Despite Super 17 being set up as the main villain, 17 is barely in the arc with most of the focus being on the easily killed past villains. The villain with the most screen time is Dr. Myuu, someone nobody was interested in seeing. Super 17 has almost no personality, acting as the type of muscle head villain we'd expect from on serial Z movies. His fight with Goku is terrible, once Goku turns Super Saiyan 4, he uses a barrage of ki attack and keeps using more when that doesn't work, which isn't how Goku normally fights. The reveal that Super 17 absorbs ki attacks is treated as him being immune to any attack Goku can launch, even though Goku could still use physical attacks (in fact he uses those more than ki attacks), plus when Super 17 stops moving because the main 17 fights to gain control, Goku punches a hole in him, at his base level.

&#x200B;

I have seen suggestions for how to fix this arc by having a more sensible explanation for why 17, and also 18 (a popular suggestion is having 18 become an antagonist), becomes evil and is a threat when the last time we saw the androids fight, they were fodder for Cell. I don't see what the point of turning the android siblings evil is. Especially 17, he barely appeared after the Cell Saga so there isn't much impact to him becoming a villain.

&#x200B;

If the route of the android being villains is used, then the anime should have given them more screen time. They could have taken part in the Dragon Ball hunt and/or appeared as allies in the Baby Saga, explaining that because they were partially mechanical, Baby couldn't control them. Having them remain allies when so many characters were controlled by a villain would have had the siblings becoming enemies have far more impact.

&#x200B;

If anybody has any other ideas for how they would make the idea of the 17 & 18 being made into tragic villains, leave a comment.

&#x200B;

Personally, I would scrap (no pun intended) the idea of using the androids as villains. Myuu and Gero kicking off the arc could stay. Gero recruits Myuu to assist with the plan to escape Hell. By using parts from Myuu's various minions who got sent to Hell, the evil scientists build a device that locates the Soul Cleansing Machine, taking inspiration from Fusion Reborn. This device has been siphoning off power from the villains to keep them growing more powerful, as well as removing the evil from the souls of evildoers who chose to reincarnate.

&#x200B;

The villains blow up the machine, and the release of evil makes them more powerful than ever. Rather than being comic relief, Cell and Frieza led the onslaught of evildoers as they broke out of Hell to take their revenge on Goku and his friends.

&#x200B;

From here, we get a series of fights with the protagonists fighting the past villains. I haven't thought of all the matchups except for the climax.

&#x200B;

Cell finds Mr. Satan and reveals him to be a fraud by killing one of Mr. Satan's fans on live television. He doesn't care about Mr. Satan taking credit for defeating him (he didn't even realize it happened) he is merely hoping to break the world's spirits. Cell is faced by Gohan, who is not nerfed in my version of events, and Pan, who is not a damsel in distress in my version of events. Gohan barely gets to do anything, especially with his daughter. Given how much screen time Pan gets, her father should get to do something with her. Cell is eager for the chance to get revenge on Gohan (not Goku; GT forgets that Gohan killed Cell, not Goku) and promises to make him watch as his daughter and father-in-law.

&#x200B;

In the end, a father/daughter Kamehameha kills Cell.

&#x200B;

Vegeta has an encounter with Nappa and does apologize for killing him. In the anime, Nappa and Vegeta's encounter does nothing it being Nappa, you could replace Nappa with any villain who was killed by Vegeta. I don't believe that this could lead to Nappa getting redeemed; Vegeta's redemption took a very specific set of circumstances, but if anybody has any ideas for what a redemption arc might look like, again, feel free to leave a comment. I want to hear ideas.

&#x200B;

The other main event is a rematch with Frieza, and I would rather Vegeta defeat him rather than Goku. Vegeta deserves a break.

&#x200B;

After each villain is beaten, they lose the power they gained from absorbing the raw concentrated evil so they wouldn't escape a second time.

&#x200B;

If anybody has any more ideas, please leave a comment. And please do not leave comments that boil down to ""GT was a mistake"" or ""this arc wouldn't work no matter what...""

"Getting a good ""overview"" of the anime scene for research?",Help,"I'm writing a novel where the protagonist is a walking encyclopedia of anime (and games, but this isn't r/gaming) and often sees life through a lens of tropes and references.  I've been an on-again-off-again weeb since I was little in the late 90's, so I definitely have a broad-brushstroke knowledge, but I haven't been seriously into it for the better part of the last decade, so my knowledge is way behind, and there's been such an explosion of new titles since then that I feel hopelessly lost trying to catch up.

Are there any ways you'd recommend trying to get an overview of the shows I should check out and .  For example, when I was a kid, I had a copy of The Anime Encyclopedia (that was when most of the notable anime that existed could fit in one book) and one other I can't remember the name of, but I don't think there's been anything like that for a while.

I research by listening to podcasts like Trash Taste and video essays on various titles that seem interesting while I'm cleaning up around the apartment and stuff - and when one catches my eye, I'll watch a few episodes to get a feel of it. But I still feel like I'm just scratching the surface and am dismayed by how limited my scope is, and by how little of each series I usually have time to get into.

Best Girl of Fall 2023: Seasonal Salt with Animebracket Reborn! Nomination Day!,Contest,"Hi guys! More than four months have passed and I’m more than exciting to come back to hold out best girl of fall 2023 with our dear Animebracket Reborn! Some of you might have heard about it already, our dear friends from [Animethemes.moe](https://animethemes.moe/) show up just in time and to take the job of maintaining Animebracket. Since then they have made great effort to clean the database of Animebracket and make a beta version to test Animebracket and yesterday they finally made Animebracket public again. Lots of thanks to them! And if you have any suggestions or find any potential problems or bugs about Animebracket, you can join the [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/m9zbVy) of [Animethemes.moe](https://animethemes.moe/) to communicate with our current moderator teams of Animebracket!

So finally now is the time again for our: [Seasonal Salt!](#salt ""Seasonal Salt!"") 

Here's the quick rundown of the contest for those who aren't familiar with it (especially after a suspend of more than four months). Through the next week we will decide who [r/anime](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/)'s favorite new girl of the previous season was. Rounds will be posted **daily** at about 9pm Eastern Standard Time. (As many of previous voters might not hear the news about the reborn of Animebracket I decided to move to the old time for fall contest as it seems the traffic volume of r/anime are also higher at the original time).

**Bracket rundown:**

* 64 total girls
* **1 nomination round**
* 1 elimination round
* 1 bracket group

**Please remember to check the rules in the nomination page and who is already in the contest before nominating!**

Also, as have been discussed before in [annual salt 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/116rwo3/and_ranime_s_best_girl_of_2022_is/j983u9i/), there will be a pick-up mechanism for top sixteen-losers to fight for wild card slots for annual best girl. 

Remainder: The rule about whether or not a girl in a sequel that has appeared in the previous seasonal but do not enter the previous seasonal could be nominated in this seasonal is clarified in the current seasonal rule. As long as **she has never passed the elimination and entered the main bracket for any previous best girl/best character contests** she could be nominated. Hope this modification could help some girls who just do not get their shiny moments in the previous season get their actual chance for the seasonal!

forgetting stuff when watching anime,Help,"hi guys.
Lately, especially when watching seasonal anime, I feel like I forget too many things and feel frustrated about it.
When the new episode of a show comes out, I’ll try to ask myself what happened on the one before (does it make sense?) and most of the time I can’t remember it, and it irritates me.
But, when I try to watch the episode before the latest in order to remember what happened, just a few frame will be enough to remember everything.

This and the fact that in general I don’t have a bad memory leads me to think that this problem is related to something else, but Idk, so if you have any suggestions or similar things happened to you pls tell me! (also, it doesn’t happen only when watching seasonal anime).

2: Someone gave like 5 different characters. I remember seeing Marin but also Hanako Koyanagi from Wotakoi.

ANSWER TODAY’S QUESTION(S)

What would you do if you were being interrogated?

Is Masami the worst anime father of all time?

Bonus) Take a shot any time Kon in his blog post talking about this episode mentions the name Akio Jissoji

Bonus 2) It's very sad in hindsight that this episode is apparently based on the works of Akio Jissoji and within 5 years of each other, Jissoji and Kon died of cancer. Life is unfair.

Need an ultra specific rec,What to Watch?,"I'm fairly new to anime and I'm looking to see if there's something that has everything I'm looking for and maybe more importantly, what I'm avoiding. After a few entries, I've discovered what I really enjoy is a love story. Here's what has struck me so far:


Cyberpunk: Edgerunners

Basically perfect. It's mature, enthralling, amazing soundtrack, excellent characterization, hyper emotional, and it doesn't drag on. I do wish it had a happier ending but maybe that would have detracted from it overall. I love cyberpunk setting anyway which is what drew me to the show but David and Lucy made it perfect. I also like that they don't draw the silly faces, people don't blush constantly at inane things, and no one speaks in a register only audible to dolphins.

Darling in the Franxx:

Saw this because it came recommended after cyberpunk. Everything about 02 and Hiro is perfect. Everything else.. not so much. Aside from those two, it seems like everyone else is characterized as clueless and lifeless. I also think it's really off-putting how sexualized the act of piloting is; it gets to the point where there is so much innuendo that it honestly would be less cringy if they just had sex. It seemed like there were a lot of plot holes based around that fact too. On top of that, I don't like giant robots. I see why this came recommended but I would rather watch a supercut of just 02 and Hiro.

Castlevania:

Shockingly good. Came recommended since it's also based on a game. Crazy good voice actors, it looks like a lot of care went into animating it. Trevor and Sypha are fun to watch together and I'm glad they got a happy ending. This show really should have been shorter, they jumped the shark so many times. Besides that, I think most everyone is well characterized. 

Horimiya:

Came recommended when looking for something romantic. It definitely fits that bill but I think it suffers from the same problem as Darling in the Franxx. If it was just Hori and Miyamura, it would have been more interesting. It also does silly faces way too often. I like how realistic Hori is. I also like that they use sex as just a symbol to show romantic connection and not a plot device to create drama. 

What I gather is that I want to find something centering around a couple. The setting doesn't matter as much as long as the two characters coming together is not the focus of the plot. I like more realism and a more mature tone. Interestingly I think shows that include nudity and sex scenes tend to automatically skew toward the tone I prefer since they have to be aimed at a mature audience. And, if possible, happy endings are better- though sometimes a sad ending is the whole reason a show is good.
I also wanna hear from you if you just like the same shows I do!

TL;DR
What's a show with a couple like Lucy and David or 02 and Hiro?",False,anime,1707424444.0,1am5ibd
"Those of you who grew up in the 90's with anime, do you miss this Era of anime / Time when things seemed more ""action oriented""",Discussion,"Weird question but, does anybody miss their childhood days of watching anime and adolescence of it?  
Shows like  
Cowboy Bebop, DBZ, Trigun, Outlaw Star, Inuyasha, Gundam Wing, Even Naruto  
I guess this would be shonen genre  
But also shows like Hayao Miyazaki Movies / Escaflowne / EVA / Utena / Project A-ko

I mean, I dunno what I'm trying to say really. I feel like a lot of modern animes are more ""Moe"" or ""Fanservice"" or ""Realistic / Mature Themed"" I guess this would Seinen..  
90s had moe too like tenchi muyo / love hina and everything but Anime felt ""different"" back then to me, like I'd be SUPER HYPED to watch it and waiting for the next episodes, I think the last anime I was like this with was Bleach

I don't know what point I'm trying to make here TBH lol. Basically, there was a certain feeling I use to have with watching anime back then week by week and keeping up with newest episodes and being hyped for next ep that I no longer get anymore and everything seems more ""moe"" nowadays or rehashed type of shows I guess all the Isekai plots and modern convenience of being able to download full series and watch in a day has me burnt out a bit.

Just finished [Blend S],Discussion,"SO i originally found this anime during COVID due to the Supra memes 2.5 years ago but didn't continue after 2nd episode for some reason.

Yesterday I was feeling quite nostalgic so I started watching and honestly it was such a joy to watch it.

The show all around has such a positive vibe, no bs drama about characters misunderstanding just 12 episodes of cute interactions.

The MC likes the FMC but isn't a creep about it, unlike other MCs he not drooling over the FMCs body and actually treats her like a human who makes mistakes at times, their interactions feel natural and not cliché as you'd expect from this kind of anime.

Our FMC Maika, she is one of the cutest anime characters I have ever seen, kind, caring, a little airhead at times but overall just a gentle person.

Anyway, this was a really nostalgic experience, although I am sure COVID was a bad time period for many people but everyone in my family was fine and it was one of the most carefree and happy period of my life.

make a crew for a starship :D,Discussion," You must crew a starship with anime people.

You must have:

Captain.

First Officer.

Operations.

Navigation.

Tactical,

Medical.

you may have any other crew at positions you think would fit.

Clearly you could go with people that know what they are doing (Henry Gloval, Robotech for Captain)

Or you could go with just - whoever is funny or you think could do the job well enough. Or maybe you will crash and burn :D

They can be all from the same anime but cooler if they are not.

\~\~\~\~

Misty likes to boss people around and given that she was a leader of a gym, she could do well as leader - if we tack on some age to her, she would work as a CO.

Light is hyper focused on justice once he gets the death note, but before that is a smart young adult, if he never encountered the Death Note he might indeed be very good at a role such as this.

Dana has been in the Southern Cross, and as such knows the ropes, so to speak, but she might not quite fit the mold for Ops, still she is smart enough and clever so maybe she could do okay.

Mendoza has used the stars to navagate the waters of the earth, with enough infomation, I think he could apply that to outerspace as well.

Porco knows how to fight :D

Ami always wanted to be a doctor, now she is one. \^\_\^

Better adaptation than TYBW?,Discussion,"Serious question, is there any anime out there that is a better adaptation of the source material than Bleach TYBW? TYBW has god tier ost, amazing fight animations and art style/design choices, incredible voice acting, and great extensions to fights and scenes. And on top of all of that it adds so much new content to the show that expands the lore, shows off character abilities that weren’t seen in the manga, and changes entire story beats to give characters deserved spotlight.

So is there any anime adaptation out there that’s better? Not just an anime that’s good, or something like Demon Slayer that has great animation and ost. But something that truly elevates the material from the manga?",False,anime,1707407542.0,1alysse

Incongruities in Sasaki and Peeps,Discussion,"I’m watching episode five of Sasaki and Peeps, and I have some questions, so I’ll get straight to the point. 

The first thing I noticed is that the law enforcement dispatched to the crime scene were just casually speaking loud enough about Sasaki-san’s ability to spontaneously create icicles. At least, loud enough for his roommate to hear, which makes me wonder if leaks like this are often so easy to come across. This is modern Japan meaning there is access to the internet and information spreads like a memetic virus. Even if they could somehow stifle discussion around it, there is no way this super secret agency is lax about letting information get out and then only getting serious and putting their full power into silencing it when it does. 

The second is about Hoshizaki-san’s psychokinetic abilities. She can control the properties of water including its temperature, right? Surely she doesn’t *need* to bring a water bottle with her at all times, because she can just condensate the water vapor in the air. Tokyo is known for being especially humid because of its location on the Earth and [anthropogenic water vapor emissions](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2007WR006624) because of the urban environment.

Likewise, Madoka Magica was nice, concluding it's original story after one season 

Do you have any others? Don't limit yourself based on the anime I've mentioned in this post but it is OK to sat ""if you liked that, you might like this other thing""

When i was a kid I had VHS copy of an anime film. I loved it. Watched it all the time. I dont know the title, but I remember the movie clearly.

She has a henchman/hitman with a very distinctive aesthetic. He has a gasmask in the shape of an elephant face. Complete with tusks. I believe he also shoots some form of darts from his hands but that could be me getting my wires crossed. Another part that stands out is the evil empress has these faces that crawl around on legs. I remember at one part one of these faces is killed with a throwing knife.

Is anyone else only watching Solo Leveling bc the OP is cool?,Discussion,"Tbh I'm pretty bummed by Solo Leveling. I had high expectations, and the first two episodes were cool. And then it went straight to boring and pretty disappointing. I didn't read the webtoon or anything but I hate the ""weak soft guy gets strong and mean"" thing that seems to happen in most webtoons with overpowered characters. 

Seeing episode 3-4 really bummed me out. Like a lot of anime this season they started strong and now it's plummeting.

I don’t understand why people hate fan service,Discussion,"I genuinely don’t get it and it’s frankly annoying to see so many people completely throw out good stories because they were distracted by fan service and didn’t like it. I understand that there’s TPO for it but even when it seems out of place (ex. Tamaki from Fire Force), does it REALLY distract you? I can’t exactly bring a lot of examples where fan service is prevalently out of place because I don’t think I’ve ever noticed it tbh. The biggest of these is Fire Force based on the amount of complaints I’ve seen on it and even that complaint doesn’t make sense to me. Clearly the animanga doesn’t take itself seriously enough to even say that it gets completely ruined by fanservice, and the funniest part is that it is literally the part of Tamaki’s character. You can’t say it’s out of place when it’s been purposely built into the script from the beginning and has a genuine cause behind it that makes sense for the story. 

I’m just so confused by how people find it distracting to point of putting you off of the entire show. Is it just a tolerance difference between those who get put off and those who don’t? To me it sounds more like a personal inclination of the viewer to sexualize any revealing thing or erotic undertone. 

For some context on my standpoint. I don’t find a woman in a bikini sexually pleasing unless we’re in a romantic relationship, similarly I don’t find an anime character who got caught changing and just in her underwear pleasing either, thus in the the grand scheme of consuming, I’m not distracted nor pay it any mind.

I don’t mean any negativity towards those who do get put off by fan service, I’m just confused on the why it’s so distracting to you because it seems more like a personal sexualization than a problem with the show itself?",False,anime,1707362525.0,1alm04s

What are you guys favorite anime dubs?,Discussion,"Just curious was all as I’ve noticed that when it comes to anime itself, people usually say to stick with the subbed version first, but then it got me wondering about cases where the English dub managed to be just as worthy.




For me personally, some examples include shows like Outlaw Star and Cowboy Bebop as don’t get me wrong that hearing the former subbed is still good, but when I listen to the (uncut) dub it just feels so good in performance as it goes so well with the show’s Western feel that it can be hard to tell that I am watching a dubbed anime because of how the dub is performed.




Yeah sometimes when it comes to anime in general, there have been some rare cases where the JP dub wasn’t the only way to watch the show, but if anyone has any examples they would like to share, then feel free to do so as anime dubs can be fascinating to listen to sometimes.",False,anime,1707357249.0,1alk7jv

Trying to find a old Ecchi anime,Help,"I’m trying to remember the name of an old Ecchi anime from when I was younger. I remember some key details from it too.

The main girl had pink hair

It was from the 2000’s 

It was a Ecchi Harem anime

It had the characters go to school

The first part of the opening episode had the pink hair girl had a panty shot and got angel wings

It had 1 episode where the main character was tied up and in his swim suit

Another episode where it was raining and the main character helped out another girl apart of the Harem

There was a trio of girls who were the antagonist who hated the main character 

And finally I believe there was a OVA where the main characters went to the where it was uncensored and you got to see everything. 

And also in that OVA too the trio of girls piloted a robot

For a while I thought it was called Girls Bravo but it just showed me Bravo Girls. Another show I thought it might be was Heaven's Lost Property but the animation was too good to be that. The animation in the show I’m looking for is like early to mid 2000’s anime where it looked shiny and flat, similar to looking like elfin lied (and also no it’s not Elfin lied either it wasn’t gory).

Then the plane bombs the snipers position and the two soldiers move on.

S1 Episode 5 – The Holy Warrior

ANSWER TODAY’S QUESTION(S)

If you were transported to another world, which reaction would you more likely have: Maniwa's, or Ikari's?

Did you ever think we would get a video game episode out of this show?

Bonus) Who would win in a fight: Holy Warrior, God Warrior, or The Ultimate Warrior?

Bonus 2) With the two detectives being transported into a video game world, does this technically make the show now an isekai?

"Came back from a long hiatus, need reccos",What to Watch?,"So Ive not watched a single anime since Parasyte, Another and OPM about a year + ago (maybe even more).

Recently I watched Hellgirl and ended up binging on more supernatural anime. Back to back completed Hellgirl, Shiki, the rooftop one with the schoolgirl and pantsu shots lol.

Tried watching The New World but Ive kinda tapped out midway, it just didnt click for me.
Of the recent ones Ive watched I think Shiki stuck with me the most. So Im looking for similar anime to that.

- Harry Potter (both)

Recomend finished anime with OP MC,What to Watch?,"Hi there good people, i have watched quite a lot of anime lately and although i wibe with a lot of them (a lot of isekai, prog fantasy, OP MCs)  but im fed up with one or two seasons and neverending waiting. Recently i watched Arifureta wich i liked. Somewhat dickish OP MC (like shield hero season one) is nice food. But it is not finished. Like there is nothing with end. Isekai is basically never a finished show aside from old clasics like Magic night Rayearth or Hack.

So, recomend me some FINISHED (not canceled or on hiatus or Berserk) anime with OP MC, preferably with dickish personality but not necesary.  Can be fantasy, isekai, scify, whatever category Slime was.... i dont really care. 

Im kinda boomer in this.  In ye old times i feel like there were so many shows that told its story in season or two and now everything is Naruto (i love naruto but when i started it it was allmost over). I dont know how to navigate this anime climate. I did not watch much for a few years and its just copletely different climate now.

Thank you very much :)",False,anime,1707327845.0,1al8rzf

Recommendations for similar anime please?,What to Watch?,"Hi all!

Do you guys have any recommendations for Anime like these, and these reasons (doesn't have to be the same genre):

* **Solo Leveling**
   * Serious & dark (but not Shield Hero dark) beginning, undertone of mystery and intrigue of future events, fantastic art helps deliver on all of the above. There's also a real sense of progression for MC's power and story both.
   * Ofc the show is new with only a few episodes out, but it reminds me of Berserk of Gluttony but better (so far)
* **Apothecary Diaries** / **The Saint's Magic Power is Omnipotent**
   * Female MC that's not OP (in combat), emphasizing everyday stuff like research & studying & relationships with a budding romance, without being only about the romance either
   * A good, strong guy protecting the MC for that daww <3
* **World Trigger**
   * Just fantastic in every way, esp high internal consistency and logic behind every person & event, also an interesting story with progression

Also one last weird question: I just started watching Absolute Duo (not convinced so far but nvm that). In the first episode \[Spoilers: Absolute Duo s01e01\] >!the school forces the students to fight their partner, and only the winner gets admitted. I couldn't help but think: what if the MC had simply lost on purpose because: 1) the school lied and set those conditions to force the students to give their best so they could be measured for their potential, but were really going to allow admittance to both either way, or 2) the school really did use arbitrary, unreliable, even cruel methods to disqualify potentially brilliant students, in which case it didn't live up to its reputation and the MC would rather just take their skills elsewhere instead. Either way, from the MC's PoV losing would be the right choice.!<

Is there any anime where the MC openly stands up to and criticizes flawed systems and authorities regardless of consequences, but is also strong enough to be able to afford to, even force the systems and authority figures themselves to change for better in the end? So the story would revolve around that? I know this is a weird question, but this is something of a recurring pet peeve of mine about a lot of shows and games too where I wish some shows handled it like this! The Irregular at Magic High School kinda touches on this idea, but not really.

Thank you all in advance!

Edit: Oh and bonus points if it's available on Crunchy in Europe! Thanks!",False,anime,1707323758.0,1al73qc

On the one hand, I love all of the Japanese signs, on the other, I feel conflicted about how Itsuomi treats Yuki. I showed my mom and she felt like he was rude to touch her so much and get up in her face, but also loved how he actively wanted to learn her language, and seems to be invested in actively using it with her.

She said Oushi is ""typical over protective hearie."" She could definitely relate to Yuki's family not knowing sign, as my grandparents (while incredibly progressive about it for their time in other areas) also never learned her language. I'd love to hear other opinions!!!

Refently I saturated my favourite anime to watch and currently I‘ve binged Frieren both anime and manga, I have to say that i absolutely didn’t thought it could hook me so much, the animation is superb, character are well designed and their chemistry is great, I especially love how well it balances action, adventure and [Iyashikei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iyashikei)  vibes.

I‘ve taken this example because it encompass very well what I search in anime, something that is visually appealing (mushishi, mob psycho, bungou stray dogs, vivy fluorite song, nichijou, berserk the old one, ghost in the shell); has a solid engaging story that isn’t predictable unlike anime such as Black Clover or Shield Hero (my brain still hurts); has a certain level of attention for soundtrack and music (i don’t expect something as vivy fluorite, beck or the amazing Takt Op.).   


You will see that i’m missing a lot of classics like Code Geass but I really can’t stand that style of animation and sadly for me it’s a deal breaker even if the anime is good. I‘m not expecting bones, madhouse or mbappa level of animation every single episode, hell I’ve enjoyed Pop team epic, inferno cop and other weird anime because of their creativity and smart use of simple animation to deliver great story or great action / funny scenes. 

While i’ve said that i enjoy the [Iyashikei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iyashikei) genre I tend to get bored quickly as my level of attention has been dramatically abused by the fast paced and action packed genre. Masterpieces as Mushishi of Aria are surely great but I consume them very slowly and occasionally. 

Ideally I would search something with the story of Fruit Basket, the animation that can span from Great Teacher Onizuka (one of my favourite of all time, I’ve read everything from the author) to the much modern Heavenly Delusion (which was sadly a delusion), the comedy of Nichijou, Full Metal Panic or Golden Boy or Love is war.

I’m aware of great suggestions such as Yuru Camp, Place further than the universe, Toradora, Wonder Egg Priority, The Melancholy of... etc but for now i’m searching something else. 

I’m more than open to other suggestions of other genre the only condition is that i’m asking you your really favourite and best and most emotional anime the you hold dear.

- As you can tell from my list, I definitely lean towards action, but I am willing to watch a show with less action if the story is that good. 
- I prefer cool lore & world-building over anything else. 
- Please don’t roast me for this one, but I don’t like when most of the characters or the MC look like literal children, but are adults, it really throws me off. If just a couple characters are like that, then it’s fine.

Anime with a nameless protagonist / The Tatami Galaxy rec,What to Watch?,"Just finished The Tatami Galaxy.  I was wondering whether there are other shows where the protagonist is never referred to by name or has no name.

Anime where the mc is special?,What to Watch?,"So i'm looking for an anime where the mc has a special power, that only he has and organizations are targetting him.

Please give some recommendations 🙏",False,anime,1707311010.0,1al2fzd

Looking for adventure show from when I was younger.,Help,"There was this show where this kid was looking for this king or something to save the world. In one of the episodes, he comes across this cabin with these old people in it and the kid couldn’t understand them. The people were hospitable but later on we realise that they were speaking backwards and that they wanted to torture the kid or something. Sorry if this is vague, not actually sure if it was an anime or if it was just animated. I’m like 18, so it would be on like on to like 8 years ago. Thanks 🙏.",False,anime,1707310292.0,1al27s3

trying to get into anime,What to Watch?,"hey guys!

so basically i’ve seen death note, banana fish, promised neverland and half of the first season of attack on titan (i literally remember nothing about it so i’ll restart). and recently i’ve had the urge to get back into anime!

so i was just wondering what you guys recommend. i don’t want to commit to something that has A LOT of episodes like one piece and naruto. a couple seasons is cool. my favourite genres are: action, drama, crime, fantasy and like the found family trope!",False,anime,1707306417.0,1al13yx
