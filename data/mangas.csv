(Not a joke) what would be an appropriate manga for a toddler?,"
I realise how crazy this sounds - but I (31 M) have never met my nephew. I live in the UK and my sister and her family live in the Oceania. He's obviously young, but from what I gather, very intuitive and smart. I used to read a lot of books myself from a young age and became engrossed in all kinds of books (text, comics, manga etc) when I first encountered them. I'd like to gift him a manga, or even a graphic novel, that he could read at his age (or even a little older!) so I can plan a reading list that I can agree on with my sister. We were both of the age when Sailor Moon and the like hit the cable channels so are familiar with Japanese media like anime, saw manga in stores and learnt to read it (ie reading right to left), but I'm also aware this could be confusing and don't want to be disruptive to his development and education. I just want to give him choice of media, and since they live in a region closer to the east than I am, they may consider visiting Japan > US (who wouldn't at this time?!) 

I've sent money for a few standard picture books like The Tiger Who Came To Tea and The Very Hungry Caterpillar, but if there's anything my sister and husband could read to him and show him, I'd really appreciate it. But if there's a more basic manga that may aid his literary skills, or if he's too early for that, I'd appreciate the advice. It's just a thought. My brothers family have been able to visit them more than we have because they have money to burn and we don't, and are also closer geographically, so I'd like to be able to introduce him to different ways of understanding without overwhelming him. Does this make sense? I hope it does.",False,manga,1705883932.0,19cioof,

Looking for a isekai manga,"I think it was the standard format of a guy inheriting his grandmother's (or someone elses) old house and finding a portal that leads him to another world.

In this new world he appears in a cabin that is right in the middle of an extremely dangerous forest (like S ranked monsters roaming around) but the house happens to have some sort of barrier around it making the monsters stay away.

He somehow becomes extremely op. I don't remember how but it was very quickly so I think it was more like a inheritance than actual training.

He finds some sort of princess/important girl in danger out in the woods and rescues her. She goes back to her city. I think something happens, she suggests getting the help of that op guy she met in the forest (mc) so she goes back to find him again.

I also remember later on some assassin type girl goes after mc since she's heard from the nobles that they have some op hidden card in the forest but instead mc ends up saving her from monsters and they start to develop an amicable relationship (he doesn't know she's an assassin). It ends with her not having the courage to kill him since he was so kind to her so she just leaves without saying anything.

All I remember from the general story is basically just the mc staying in the forest and the female lead going back and forth between the forest and the city. I don't remember any significant event except for the assassin thing but I'm not sure if this is due to it having a low amount of chapters or if the story stuff just wasn't very good",False,manga,1705881968.0,19chzpl,

The reason for this thread's existence is the fact that both requests and suggestions became kind of stale. It's supposed to bring out more manga that is not RTed or recommended. Also, it's quite useful for the discussion of not so current titles.

Previous weeks: [First 72 weeks](http://www.reddit.com/r/manga/search?q=author%3Agladiatorua+What+manga+have+you+read+this+week%2C+and+what+do+you+think+about+it%3F&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all#page=1) and from [June 28, 2015 onwards](http://www.reddit.com/r/manga/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+What+manga+have+you+read+this+week%2C+and+what+do+you+think+about+it%3F&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).

Also, not a rule or any kind of criticism, the more interesting part is not the list of the stuff you read, but your impressions of it.

So in order to keep her and not him they decided to kill him off, while she was off fighting in the dongen they pushed him into a trap for him to die. Then tell his friend that he died in a trap, and though she still wanted to go after him they convinced her it be pointless as he was weak and wouldnt survive anyways.

When they got on the plane the guy left her on the plane by herself. Later finding out he committed suicide. A few months later she gave birth to a baby.,False,manga,1705858034.0,19c8iw5,

Best science fiction and fantasy manga that have good/positive representations of women/girls.,"
Basically I’m looking for science fiction and fantasy manga that:

•Avoids the Stay in the kitchen trope: where women are expected to sit on the sidelines and let the men do all of the work.

•Avoids the [Faux Action girl trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl): where the women’s intelligent, skills, and strengths are just informed attributes. And she’s only included to try and make the work look more progressive than it actually is.

•Avoid or subvert the [Defied Forever trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever).

•Any achievements they have made have to be based on their skills and merits, not based on their looks or who they slept with.

•Avoids being a wet blanket or a soapbox Sadie.

•Avoid or subvert the [Men act, Women are trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenActWomenAre)

•Avoid The [Vasquez always dies trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VasquezAlwaysDies)

•Give them greater ambitions than just being the love interest and getting married to a man or getting laid with one.

•However, for those that insist on ending the story with the female characters retiring from “heroing” or whatever they were doing before to become housewives or Yamato Nadeshikos at the very least avoid depicting them as pushovers and getting into marriage that have some unfortunate implications (Ex: large age gap, marrying someone that has misogynistic tendencies or has sexual harassed or assaulted them).

O capitulo final ele saem em um encontro no aquario, nesse encontro eles depois de um tempo dão as mãos e andam juntos, após o passeio terminar eles vão para o estacionamento ou uma parte fora do aquário, la o garoto fala pra ela que tem algo para dar a ela, ele se aproxima e da um beijo nela, depois do beijo a garota fica muito emvergonhada e pede a ele para beija-la novamente, FIM.

I don't remember it fully but:The MC is sent to a mandatory school/academy for training and survival.

The MC is mostly oblivious to how rude how his class is treating them and constantly tries to help whenever.

Later on in the series he stumbles upon another class' student who turns out to have the \[Miko} class and is having difficulty hunting with the bow provided to her. The MC takes it upon himself to create an Eastern-style bow (one that she said she was more used to) and arrows to help her out. She \[Miko} asks to become a disciple under him for training, and he somewhat agrees as long as she \[Miko\] becomes friends with the girl \[Saintess\] in his class.

- mc is male and there’s little to no romance
- it should be a full colour webtoon/manhwa (Korean)
- the setting was olden european (church/religious) but there was also martial arts (mc’s master taught him a form of fighting that I think was martial arts)
- world building had monsters that humans were generally subjugating/fighting
- the church had a good and a secret evil faction, with everyone trying to figure out who’s in the evil faction 
- there were relics that the church used to defeat the monsters/power up
- at some point the next in line religious leader was betrayed by someone he trusted (he had a really big pillar close to him when he got betrayed, setting wise)

What's that yaoi manga??,"Alright, so I many years ago I would frequent deviantart and there were panels of a comic that would pop up that led me a the website of a manga webcomic. It was a while ago so hard to remember the exact premise but I believe that it was about sex workers, and there was one very innocent and shy boy with pink curly hair, a taller more muscular outgoing guy with tattoos and i think like a sort of down mohawk that was red (possibly electric blue but i think red), there were also women too. It was like a prostitute house i believe.

I recall the pink curly hair boy had a lot of childhood flashbacks. It was all very old-timey and fancy, dresses wirh ruffles and ruffled collars and vests.. but not strictly. There was a patron who frequently ordered the pink hair boy who was a tall quiet man with long straight black hair, and the curly hair boy was always super shy around him.. i remember once he brought quiche as a gift to the tall black haired guy and it was awkward.

There is plenty of sex and nudity in it as well. Its a very beautifully drawn comic, with leave shadows, courtyards, all in like a big mansion.. 

So any ideas?? This was back in like 2010s.. something like that. Maybe earlier.

The reason i am looking is I am reading a book called Kusheil's Dart and the imagery makes me think of that comic.",False,manga,1705794361.0,19bpi1s,

I initially found this manga in the comment section of a thread that was discussing disturbing manga such as the one featuring Junko Furuta's story and such other things.  


Now onto the manga I'm trying to remember, it featured two male main characters who ran a shop somewhere in 90s Japan that carried out Vigilante services for customers that could not go to the police to get revenge for example rape victims or homicide cases etc, most of the targets would usually end up with major injuries or straight up having their corpses displayed in public with body parts missing. I remember one of the main characters being an older male and it was assumed that he was a retired Yakuza member as he had no tolerance for criminals and would torture and kill them without batting an eyelid, while the other main character was a young adult who was unaware that his partner was torturing the targets.

Please help me,"So, I have searched for this manga I read sometime back and I need help finding it. So it starts out with this girl(MC) living in a slum city and in an apocalyptic world. The rules in the city is that if you commit a crime, you get the death penalty, and this one specific dude (I will call enforcer) that's basically the strongest will kill you. It's aggressive with the rules too, like there was a little girl that stole a teddy bear for her little brother, and she got killed. The story goes that the MC is strong and good at boxing(eventually unlocks fire power), so she lets anyone beat her up on the street for money. One day a rich government official beats her up then starts sexually assaulting her, so she fights back, but that's illegal, so she's on the run. Eventually she gets saved by a small group of revolutionaries, and starts working for them. The whole thing about the revolutionaries is that they want to change the government, but not kill anybody, big peaceful takeover ideology. The leader is a kid that can control people, there is a small scientist in a robot, a fat swordsman, and a humanoid fox that was part of the church, and uses guns that look like a cross. That's the general overview, but the art for the series is pretty distinct from what I remember. It's mostly black and white, but there are colors added to represent different peoples powers, and ideals. So the main characters fire power, and the ideology of the revolution is blue, the enforcer is wavy dark red, and that's all I remember. Don't take this last part as seriously, but for some reason, I remember the title has to do with the MC power or name, like blast or blazing(idk).  ",False,manga,1705790278.0,19bnz47,

Help me find a manga with lock and key motifs,"Hi! So, approximately 10 years ago around 2012-2014 I read the two first volumes of a manga that I can not find for the life of me. I do not remember the title or names of any characters. Based on the intricate art style it looked to have been made anywhere between 2000-2010, and I had bought them secondhand. I read it in Finnish so it was might have been translated into other languages as well. It did not seem like a huge title and I'm not aware if it had an anime adaptation or not.

It was a fantasy manga that centered around two teenage sisters, one whose powers could open locks (locks between worlds or something like that) and the other could close them. The sisters based on my memory were sheltered orphans, and the story begins with one of them being kidnapped by some sort of antagonist, while the other tries to find/save her. I think the cover art had brownish colors and featured the lock / key motifs as well as one of the sisters.

I know this is all really vague and some details could be wrong, but this is my last resort. I've tried looking up manga on Finnish websites, browsed through a bunch of secondhand bookstores and searched online with no luck. When I search ''manga lock and key'' or something like that it just brings up the show Locke & Key.

I never got to finish the manga and am looking to reread it, as I remember loving the premise back then. Any help is appreciated!

What's the best way to enjoy manga without access to the physical medium?,"I'm rather new to manga in general. I began reading manga a bit over 2 months ago and so far I've read *Fumikiri Jikan*, *Gakkougurashi!*, *Angel Beats: Heaven's Doors* and *Joshikausei*. Finding these mangas was relatively easy because a couple of them were available on Crunchyroll before they closed their manga section, and they're not too niche or rare as to not be able to find them.

Recently, I bought physical manga for the first time: *Sekai no Owari to Yoakemae*, the first volume of *Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso* and the boxset for *Another*. I've been having a blast reading these mangas in physical format, it feels authentic and immersive.

However, I've quickly run into a bit of an issue, you see, I'm limited to buying manga from local licensed editorials which localize them and distribute them in my country. Buying manga in English or any other language for that matter is not really possible due to the incredible cost of doing so. Imagine that buying only the first volume of *Nichijou* in English would cost me some $50 USD, and that's not including taxes + shipping, and consider that the average wage where I live is roughly $300 USD. Even mangas that are licensed and distributed here end up being relatively expensive (albeit much cheaper than importing anything), the catalogs are very limited, and they run out of stock really fast. (the *Suzumiya Haruhi* Series have been out of stock for years, for instance).

As I said previously, I've read most manga online, but the experience is mediocre at best. Most of the time it implies visiting some ad-filled websites, they might be missing chapters, and the quality of the scans might be rather terrible. This is also implying I can even find the manga I'm looking for; I enjoy some niche stuff, such as *Angel Beats! The 4-koma: Bokura no Sensen Koushinkyoku♪*, but this is a manga that only has a few chapters scanned.

The question is practically the one in the title: what's the best way for me to enjoy manga, considering I have considerably limited access to the physical medium? Is just reading scans by fans off crappy websites with missing chapters the only way? Or is there perhaps something more preferable I've been missing?",False,manga,1705748476.0,19b9dp9,

Can’t remember name of Manga/Manwha.,"So I watch a lot of recap videos on YouTube and recently  I remembered one of my favorites that should have gotten an update by now but I couldn’t find the name saved anyway or find it in my months of recent YouTube history (or all history by keyword searches) From what I remember, it is similar to solo leveling in that it has hunters and guilds in the modern era. The MC is male and due to ranking is expected to be weak by everyone but turns out to be OP. In the early chapters one guild (with a female leader) grows suspicious and starts stalking and researching him to figure out if he is hiding something. There is also another “famous” guild that has some cocky guy who is attacking/threatening his sister to which he shows up in time to save. When he gets there his sister is worried but he beats up the famous and supposedly OP Hunter rather easily to everyone’s (including his sister’s) surprise.

So it's the classic ""I reincarnated as the Villainess of a dating sim"" but in this one she's discovered as a reincarnated by the Villainess brother, also, in the story the Villainess became one after loosing her parents to a monster stampede caused by an undiscovered dungeon.

Looking for Manga I forgotten,"Hello, I'm trying to remember the title of a peticular Villainess manga but I just can't seem to find it.

The story goes that this Mc gets reincarnated as a villainess but the main twist I'd that the otome game story has her character get killed in a whole bunch of was ranging from a fire ball to the face, her sister, even high cholesterol. Her in game stats are also pretty weak and the only attack she is supposed to specialize in is the Boston Crab wrestling move.

And just like most Villainess Otome manga she unintentionally attracts the capture targets like her ex fiance who had a grudge on commoners (because his elder sister ran away to get married to one) and a competitive crown prince.

She also befriends the crown prince's sister who is kind of cursed to decay anything near her.

A manga about a shy and anxious girl working at a cafe,"Please help me find this manga. I thought I had this saved but sadly I don't. The manga is about a high school girl who is very anxious and shy. She has a stutter. Her hair is short, around her ears. He has a very hard time speaking at school, and sometimes is made fun of. Other students are more sympathetic.

She decides to be brave and gets a job at a cafe where she will have to talk to customers. The cafe is owned by an older man who is thin. It is not a new manga, either in art style or content--I'm 99% sure I've never seen a cell phone and a lot of customers smoke inside.

One of the storylines is about her helping a girl who was raped or about to be, and later the same girl setting her up to be raped. (She escapes.)

Once, she also gets the courage to hang with some customers and gets drunk. When she does, she can speak without her stutter.

Another storyline is when she helps a college student customer and his friends in painting the side of a building so it looks like it blends with the sky.

She is being pursued by two customers, one who goes to school with her.

I’ll try to recall as much as I can remember 

So as a child MC was on his way to his friends house and saw said friend on the balcony and I think called out to him? Friend sees mc and leans over the balcony waving and ends up falling off and hurting themselves really bad. (It’s presumed that they died I think) 
There’s a time skip to when MC is older(college age?) and it seems as thought the friend survived as they are still hanging out together but when another  guy starts to take interest in MC, Said Guy tells mc later on in their relationship something along the lines of “there is no one there” meaning that friend is either dead or not around and mc has been imagining their friend the entire time 

I remember the friend having pinkish/red hair

And the first chapter had pinkish/red friend sitting/leaning on a balcony threatening MC saying that they would jump.

If this sound familiar pls say the title!
If you need more context let me know, I wanna find this one!

Edit!: I remembered something else!
Turns out the friends parents didn’t let mc see them after their bad accident as a child. The friend is alive! Just living his own life without mc

But MC is able to meet up with friend to establish that they didn’t die.

I’m looking for something with a similar setting to Kara no Kyokai (Garden of Sinners), as while I’ve only seen the first movie, I was hooked to the overall setting of a hidden magical community unknown to the rest of the populace. I also admire the light novel Vampire Hunter D, as the setting of fantasy and sci fi, vampires, and the main character, D, got me wanting for more. I also read and really enjoyed Tokyo Ghoul, both for the plot and the way how the titular ghouls function in a modern setting.

[Question] Looking for specific Romance story,"Hello,

Before you criticize me. I have looked into the Subreddit and MAL. But I cannot find something for myself.

Anyway. I'm looking for a specific kind of Romance story. 

A story with a female MC that is/was (bullied,disliked, or similar) even by his crush(not necessary). But then everything changes and romance develops. If the Manga/... is finished it should have a Happy End (couple together and live happly ever after)

OR/AND

A female MC. That's in Love with someone but the persons doesnt like her at the start and its cold to her. Then after some chapters it starts to change. Also a Happy end if the story is finished.

What I liked and its similar (i didnt read a lot but watched a lot of Anime)

- Itazura na Kiss (Long time ago)
- Operation: True Love (My favorite all time)
- Reading: I love Yoo

What if Shoko and Yuta finds a way to revive Gojo (they make an binding vow or something idk) and they revive Gojo. But somehow Toji's soul sneaks in and instead of Gojo, Toji will be revived. And I thought maybe he will learn that Sukuna killed Megumi inside him and he will attack Sukuna for revenge of his son. And he will deal a good damage and save Megumi (then he dies again).

Elusive title search - please help,"I'm searching for the name of a manga series I started reading a few years ago. I've spent hours on various websites filtering tags, I've tried describing it to Ai - all to no avail.

The clues are as follows:

* Young (late teens?) male protagonist learning the ropes & how to fend for himself
* Fantasy setting - some island/continent where humans are trying to colonise
* Samurai/historical tech level - protagonist uses spears, swords, bows, wooden shields
* Orcs, other monsters live on island/continent & skirmish/war against the humans
* Realistic feel: survival is tough, in depth analysis of what weapons & tactics to use, there's blood, gore & nudity, characters & situations are ""grey"" & not melodramatic

What it is not:

* Isikai - protagonist grew up in world & sought out the adventure
* High fantasy (ie. no magic & wizards as far as I read)
* Manhau, manhwa, webcomic, etc.

Specific scenes I can recall:

* Upon arriving at the main port/fort the young protagonist must fight a captive goblin/creature. He learns valuable lessons when he manages to make his first kill & is respectful to his fallen ""teacher""
* In one of the skirmishes the protagonist is running with a group of soldiers/adventurers to some battle/event when he leaves the group to investigate something in the forest. It was an enemy orc with a massive sword. Instead of fighting he shares food because the orc had a young human with him the orc was caring for
* There was an antagonist called ""White Mask"" or ""White Death""? He was a faun/creature that moved very quickly and hounded forts & human groups
* Early on there was an introductory expedition to show the newbies how dangerous the island/continent was, how to keep quiet and travel so-as to increase their chances of survival
* The orcs kept humans as slaves & one of the top human fighters (a young woman who fought naked?) reality checked some girls recently caught that they needed to accept their new plight else the orcs dispose of them

I bought the Innocent omnibus just to support the author in hopes of getting the climber in English and now I can't wait for Innocent vol 2,"To be honest I am not sure if I should recommend Innocent to everyone (I probably shouldn't) but this manga is something else. It's supremely fucked in a very realistic way, very dramatic, very unsettling, and it's the first manga I've read in a long time that I catch myself thinking about regularly. (It's a historical manga about the man who invented the guillotine)

I initially bought innocent just to support the author in hopes that his other series, ""the climber"" would get published in English, as dark horse stated that their interest in licensing that series depended on the sales of innocent. 
Side note 1: I know the climber is available online in certain places but I personally refuse to read manga on a screen. I'm happy to pay for a physical release.
Side note 2: I'm 30 and rock climb myself frequently and read manga even more frequently so it's no surprise that I want legit releases of the series, in addition vagabond is one of my favorite series of all time and the comparison between the climber and vagabond is something I've seen often.

So I picked up innocent and I'm somewhat blown away. The series is a masterpiece (based on reading omnibus vol 1 only). It's very different from anything I've read before. It's extremely dramatic, disturbing, and gorgeous all at the same time. Even in the most serious seinin manga I've read, there are at least moments of light-heartedness and humor (berserk, vagabond, Vinland saga), but in innocent, there are none. If there is a slight moment of hope or joy, it's only to make the next scene or arc that much more intense and depressing. The art is super detailed but isn't very reminiscent of traditional manga, it's kind of a hybrid of manga and 90's underground adult Western comics. I read a fair amount of horror manga and innocent has disturbed me more than any horror manga I've read. But, regardless, I'm hooked and absolutely can't wait for vol 2 in April.

Idk why I made this post, but I guess it's to encourage you to buy and try out innocent if this sounds like it might be your thing. I love it, I can see a lot of others also loving it (but certainly not all), and any purchase of it would increase the chances of the climber being published.

Question about Dungeon Meshi,"Does it ever get back to being a manga about cooking monsters?

Don’t get me wrong I’m enjoying it but as I get further in it feels like the story is getting further and further from what was presented as it’s base concept. Like initially it felt like them eating monsters was this main point and I was kind of expecting this story about learning to survive and live off the land but with monsters in a dungeon. But now it feels like the cooking and eating the monsters is just a gimmick on top of a solidly done fantasy story. Like from where I currently am mid way through it seems like you could completely remove them cooking monsters and it really wouldn’t harm the story. it doesn’t even seem to do much with the cooking concept at this point as most of it is just them pausing to describe what dish they made from what they recently killed but the cooking doesn’t really add anything to what’s going on. It just feels kind of like a bait and switch where it advertised weird cooking shenanigans and instead it’s a well done fantasy story. Which again not really complaining much because I am enjoying the fantasy story it just seems odd that the cooking aspect feels so superficial and I’m wondering if it ever becomes more of a main point again or if I should just continue forward expecting a fantasy story with monster cooking as a side gimmick.",False,manga,1705619885.0,19a41e8,

She's a bit cocky and I'm surprised she even has the guts to be strict and cold towards her boss. How is that even possible? She's kinda taking advantage of the fact that Konishikawa doesn't scold her. It would be cool if he goes back to his old self cause rn he just feels bland and like a pushover. I understand him being too soft now due to what happened in the past but he really needs to act like a boss. I'm trying to say that he should be overly strict but he should be strict cause Misaki really needs to be scolded.

My Biggest Problem with Hunter x Hunter,"By far the most annoying thing about HxH to me is that Togashi ends nearly every arc anti-climactically. It’s like perpetual blue balls. There are some arcs where this doesn’t really bother me that much (Yorknew and Election arc) but the vast majority end in a way that just kinda makes me roll my eyes and ask why?? Like it’s great buildup and has me hooked on the plot but then just ends lackluster. And I never really see people talking about this aspect of it so I’m wondering if anybody else has noticed it or has it just not bothered y’all like it does me.

I’ll briefly go thru the arcs and anti-climax’s 

Hunter Exam: Great buildup but then ends with Gon getting a concussion and all the final matches are all skipped over.

Zoldyck Family: They’re tryna rescue Killua from his family. They build up Killua’s family like it’s gonna be an epic showdown but it ends with Killua’s family just letting him go.

Heaven Arena: An epic battle tower buildup but after Gon loses to Hisoka they just leave.

Yorknew: Great story and builds tension masterfully with the Phantom Troupe and Gon’s crew. But just ends in a prisoner swap. (Again I didn’t mind this one)

Greed Island: To me the only arc that doesn’t end on an anti-climax. But imo easily the most boring arc

Chimera Ant: Great build up with the ants and Meruem. But after Meruem survives his fight with Netero and absorbs his Royal guards becoming even stronger, he just dies due to poison.

Election Arc: Gon set out on this whole journey to meet his dad but when he finally meets him after all this time he’s just kinda a douche. (Again I didn’t mind this one cus it’s kinda real lol all dad’s aren’t amazing heroes)

Is Forbidden Planet's (UK) Subscription Service the best kept secret in Manga?,"I've been buying manga from Forbidden Planet for nearly 20 years but it's not always easy to get to a physical shop.

It was pretty threadbare tbh, and they only had 5 of the manga's I was reading but I decided to give it a try and subscribed. Sure, you dont get the manga on the day it is released (it's usually around the end of the month) but I've not had any problems with them. 

Anyway, I checked the subscription page again yesterday and they have SIGNIFICANTLY expanded their selection so that now you can sign up to receive pretty much any manga you can think of (it also includes light novels). 

So I'm now subscribed to 14 of the 18 series I'm reading (plus two new subscriptions/pre-orders for Initial D and Smoking Behind the Supermarket With You) and it has taken all of the worry and hard work out of trying to keep up with the latest volumes across so many series.

Forgotten classics or just a US market that has moved on?,"A lot of us who came into fandom in the 80s didn't exactly have a ton of variety to choose from in our manga and anime. The availability just wasn't there. 

Now when I look at the shelves at B&N and even at collection posts, I don't see a lot of representation of those early properties. It makes me wonder if those are truly forgotten classics or just the manga and anime version of Stockholm Syndrome. I know much of it was still quality stuff, but I'm struggling with seeing the market move on from what used to be perennial titles. Of course Akira stayed relevant, Dragon Ball and Sailor Moon hung around, Takahashi's stuff has stayed in print, and it seems like Lupin III and Fist of the North Star have not been fully forgotten. But is there any modern love for 80s and 90s stuff like...

It starts off with this girl in like a traveling theatre troupe or something and she's dressed as a guy (pretty sure cause only guys can be part of the troupe). She cross dresses and I remember one chapter she gets drunk and faints and the male lead brings her back to his tent abode thingy and (almost?) discovers she's a girl and is like she smells suuper good in the same chapter too. I think he almost kisses her while she's sleeping too but idr exact 

There's a plot point in the manga where the girl slowly grows scales over her body. I think it was some like hereditary curse or something?

Problems with Physical and Digital Manga.,"I have a small problem with physical and digital manga. On one hand, I really like physical manga, its really nice to read and hold a physical book and read a good story without being on the computer. The feeling of having a solid, tangible book to read is simply great, however, its bulky, fragile, and expensive, especially with omnibus's. On the other hand, digital manga is much easier to obtain and duplicate, not to mention being incredible portable and dense. The only problem is that A: Digital manga does my head in for some reason, I can still read it, but its alot harder than reading a physical book, and I have no clue why, and, B: Reading something on a computer just doesn't feel as good. I don't know if there are any formats that could help me find a balance between the two, so if anyone knows of any that would be appreciated, it would be nice to have the tactile feel of reading a book mixed with the portability and convenience of having a computer with 100's if not 1000's of manga on it.",False,manga,1705572143.0,199mqf5,

Help Me Remember the Title of a Manga,"Hello,

&#x200B;

A few years ago (2018/2019) I was reading a manga and caught up to what was current at the time. I cannot remember the title and I read it on an obscure site which I can't find anymore as well.

&#x200B;

From my memory, I know it was an Action/Comedy series with both magic and sci-fi. I can't remember if the MC was isekied or not but he was stronger than almost everyone.

I recall that there were sanctuary cities. Like the world had gone through an apocolyce and the few cities had shields that kept the population safe. Not too long after the start the MC had to flee his town with his ""mercenary band""? out of the town because he was getting too much attention, I think.

One of the MC's gotos, when a fight was getting tense, was to create a magical flashbang and run away, always for comedic effect.

&#x200B;

I have no idea why I remember the word ""King"" regarding this manga. It could have been in the title or maybe the name of the site I read it on at that time.

desperately searching for this one manga,"i remember seeing it on a youtube video or something forever ago and comes to mind from time to time because the message it leaves and how the author presents it is kinda interesting, one of the probably one shots shows the cruel cycle of abuse starting of with a kid taking his anger out of a girl and therefore is punished cruelly by his mom, fast forward to when the kid and this girl discover how his mom is getting sexually and physically abused in a shed i thinl by this old fat ugly guy and the reason for his mom taking her anger out so harshly is cause shes seeing the abuse as normal and passing down this vicious cycle from person to mother to son to victim, thats all i can really remember i cannot find any information of this anywhere any leads of the manga or author would be appreciated 🤞
edit: i can Kinda remember it was similar to junji had that grungy vibe to it to really emphasize the psychological horror but cant confirm obviously
edit 2: can remember about more what happened clearly, only reason the kid found his mok in the shed was cause he was going back to chasing this same girl who was presumably a class mate and they stumble across weird noises coming from it, and im pretty sure the kids punishment was wither being spanked or being belted if that rings any more bells, and the kids being around 10 ish while the mom 30s maybe and it was quite anort probably 15 pages at most not a big longest series or book",True,manga,1705546605.0,199fpsl,

I read this manga like two years ago, it seems to be a bit obscure considering I couldn't find it after like 3 hours of searching. It's about a guy from the future returning or going to the past as a middle/high schooler to stop a girl from shattering the universe. She isn't aware of her connecting to shattering time, and I recall it occurring when her emotions are intense. He has a limited number of times to reverse, and I distinctly remember the manga having a counter whenever he reversed time. I remember some details, such as another character, I think her sister, being aware that she can shatter the universe, and another character from the future and same organization as him telling him that he shouldn't stay in that time because he loves her.

Re-Discovering a Manga,"Obligatory sorry if this doesn’t fit with the rules bc idk where else to post this. So I read this manga when I was in middle school roughly, so it’s been several years and I don’t remember everything properly. Ok, so it’s this high school boy who is constantly bugged by this girl who I think is a sort of demon. I think they’re a race of demons that grant 3(?) wishes, then take your soul. This boy doesn’t really want anything and tells her to not waste her time, but she’s stubborn and still hangs around him to get him to use wishes, but ofc they get close and actually become friends (and love interests). Lo and behold, ANOTHER GIRL shows up also trying to get him to use his 3 wishes, so the girls become competitive to get his soul (and eventually, it develops into who wins his heart since the other girl also falls in love with him). 


For extra specifics to find this, turns out that this is the boy’s second chance at life (AKA reincarnated) and had met girl #2 in his previous life, when he was chronically ill as a child. When they initially met, she once again was trying to make him use his 3 wishes and became friends when he didn’t and she hung around. When he’s on his deathbed, she begs him to use one of his wishes to get better, but he WANTS to die so he could be with his parents that had died before he was hospitalized. When he eventually passes away, she uses the wish(es) for him to reincarnate and have a fulfilling life.",False,manga,1705535152.0,199bl6v,

Looking for some manga recommendations! (+18 Warning),"Hi there! Hope everyone is good.  


I am struggling to find a good manga to read (because I am bit picky).  
Before starting, every thing said in this post is based in my opinion so please respect it.   


By example, I loved Eminence of Shadow anime but I would have not read its manga since I would have found it very boring, but the anime was great, I think the same for Frieren by example.  
I also loved Spice and Wolf and I'd like to find another good manga similar to it, I liked how flirty they were and so.  
To add I like pretty much isekais or fantasy stuffs but I'd like them to have romance.

Recently I have read **Watashi ga 15-sai de wa Nakunatte mo**  and well I found it very interesting (Because is something like ""new"" and no cliche as most stuffs). I have also read Komodo No Jikan.\]  
Oshi no Ko is great too, Solo leveling was good but most of the similar ones are very bad.  


Her majesty's swarm has a very good concept as well, I liked the idea of it but the manga was not very good tbh.  


  
Soooo I am looking for something similar to those I have mentioned, I mean not really similar but good, I am not very sure how to explain it but please feel free to ask something.  


Thank u all guys in advance!

Looking for an old manga or manhwa,"I'm looking for a manga or manhwa that I read quite a while ago, I think somewhen in the 2010s. I don't remember much about it, but I think it's episodic in nature, or at the very least have one self-contained chapter. The plot of this chapter is like this:

1. It took place in either a concentration camp or a prison.
2. Everyday, at the exact same time, a stoic guard would sound the trumpet (or other musical instrument), and some prisoners would be executed.
3. A child tried to befriend the guard, but the guard showed no sign of caring.
4. One day, it was set that either the child or someone close to him/her will be executed the next morning. The child came begging the guard not to sound the trumpet the next day, because he thinks the trumpet is the reason people dies.
5. The guard remains emotionless, but the next morning, instead of sounding the signal like usual, he played a song with his trumpet. This cause confusion among the prison/camp staff, and the execution was delayed till the next day.
6. The guard is then taken away for insubordination. Not much is clear about what happened after, but I remember the man remain stoic to the very end.

And this might be me mixing it up with another manga here, but if my hazy memory serve me right, I think this story is nested within a framing story. The trumpet was bring to a shop of some kind, and the story about the trumpet is told in that shop.

The main plot revolved around groups of people (clans I think?) who could summon creatures to fight for them. The main character was from the dragon clan and summoned a very godzilla-looking dragon. There was a tech themed group that summoned robots, and one survivor of the ""woman clan"" who summoned a succubus looking thing. 

The way the monsters all spawned depended on the clan and is the most distinctive detail. These things (drones or creatures idk) would fly out and pry open the characters body where the monster was supposed to come from. Dragon clan was stomach, tech people from the head, and the last one came from the ""chest"". This part wasn't gorey, for the MC it just lifted up his shirt, but the battles got bloody.

The monsters were linked with who spawned them and if they got hurt so did the summoner. The woman also dies in a self sacrifice at one point and her last scene is her unable to light a cigarette drenched in blood.",False,manga,1705988166.0,19dh6b7,

Searching for a manga for 5 years now,"Hello guys, I really don’t know what to do else but I am actually searching for a manga I’ve read in 2017. 

I only remember the main plot and some details but not even ChatGPT is able to find the right manga. I would recognise is directly from the cover.

It is a short Manga-Series, I think about 3 to 5 volumes. And the covers have a specific monochrome Color like grey, blue and green and black, remember.
All of them are somehow pastellish and show the female or male protagonist in a beautiful artwork but it’s like minimalistic.

The general plot:

It’s about two people a boy and a girl who have to kill a schoolmate of theirs by stabbing him in the hand with a hair pin as the schoolmate is holding on the body I think of the girl or boy idr while they: the schoolmate and one of them, girl or boy, are holding onto the roof their high school.

So intentionally, the plot is about the schoolmate dying because of them.

But there is more to it.
The schoolmate is the boyfriend or exboyfriend of the girl and the boy is the childhood friend of some sort.

So, I will refer to the schoolmate who died as the boyfriend and the other who is the male protagonist as just boy so there is clearance.

The girl is somehow in a relationship with the schoolmate/boyfriend/exboyfriend at beginning, obviously and then the boyfriend gets somehow jealous. Something happens that he gets very angry.

If I remember it right, it has something to do with the male protagonist and the girl having interaction but I am not sure on that boy.

Anyways, they somehow are on the roof and fight. 

The boyfriend/exboyfriend hates the male protagonist because he would look good.

I remember reading a sequence where he was talking about his mother saying that he is ugly and forcing him to have plastic surgery to look good which is why he is admired by the student in his school after.

But still he is hating the male protagonist because he would be a natural beauty.

But I am not to sure about that. It could be also because of some other thing the male protagonist has and the exboyfriend didn’t have in the past and for which he was treated badly by his mother.
 
The exboyfriend then tries to push him off the roof or something Idr.
Something happens which ends up in the girl or the boy, hanging from the roof whilst the boyfriend is holding onto to the body.

A hair pin which was a present from the boyfriend to the girl is used to stab in the hand of the boyfriend who wants to take the person who he is holding onto with him to death.

After his hand is stabbed he fells and gets killed on school ground.

The murder weapon, the hair pin is searched for.

———-

The main plot is hiding this hair pin and evidence and covering up the act by the boy, the male protagonist and the girl, the female protagonist.

In that process they develop feelings for each other if I remember it right.

Ultimately everything is covered and they try to flee by taking the train.
As they try to enter the train, the boy pushes the girl into the train and lets himself get cought.

There is a time lapse at the end of the last mange where the girl goes back to her hometown and meets the boy in a caffe.

I somehow also remember the caffe having a train-theme or something like that but the important information is that they meet in a caffe after a long time since the incident.


This is everything I remember and it is only what I remember. It is very likely that there are some mistakes and everything but I would be so so so happy, if someone could help because I really just want to read this manga again, I am literally desperate :((:////",False,manga,1705961023.0,19d7sqo,

The MC is still a dude, but one of his best guy friends was reborn as a chick, and I think the other just pretends not to remember the first two.

Point Gifter Keikenchi Bunpai Nouryokusha no Isekai Saikyou Solo Life is the manga where MC share the exp. Where my mind somehow remember it was mana, In fact it was not. 

Question: Can someone help me with the name of this manga. I cant remember the name of this manga, Basically the MC have the power to share/pool the mana to anyone in his party/guild. After he get kicked out of the party/guild. Everyone fire power suddenly decrease. But the party is in denial. Even there is doubt. When MC left the party they suddenly not as powerful as before.

i need help finding this manga,"It's a manga about a cat (probably orange, I don't remember)that can secretly talk and it's owner runs a cafe/restaurant (the owner also wears GLASSES!!!)
I'll tell a bit more detail with one of their stories : 

    While the cat was walking around, she founds a strange girl that turns out to be a vengeful ghost because her ex cheated on him (I don't remember)and the girl forces the cat to help find a key to her apartment so she can see her ex.

    After some case solving (and some funny comedy), turns out the key is near the place where she died and when she visited her ex (she's still dead) the ex apologized.

   When both the cat and the girl sit outside the restaurant that the cat owner owns, the owner walks out and sees the girl and invites her to his restaurant to eat (turns out he can see ghosts? His partner couldn't lol)

    After she came in the restaurant, the owner decided to recommend a special table(in which she did sit in)

   Middle in the cooking, the ghost girl looks out of the window and sees the beautiful Sakura trees and asks if she can reserve the table for next year(idk I forgot) the owner agrees only to be confused when the girl suddenly disappeared.

   It then cuts to somewhere in the hospital, where it turns out the girl has been revived and she askes her mother of they could go to the same restaurant earlier to reserve a table.

And no, that's not the ending. It's probably 1/7 or 1/5 of the actual story where the secretly-talking-cat has some adventures and little comedy (all different times)

[MISSING/LOST] Osmosis Jones/Ozzy and Drix Manga,"&#x200B;

Hello!! I’m currently trying to find any new information on a manga that’s been missing since 2007.

In 2001 the film Osmosis Jones was released and it did insanely badly in the box office, the film had a budget of 75 million and only made 14 million back. 

The reason I’m mentioning this is because they had a whole range of figurines, playsets, snacks and even stuff like soap with the films name on it. The reason I’m bringing this up is because all of this stuff would only get made if the film made a profit of 60 million, which it missed by a long shot.

The film somehow got a spin-off cartoon called Ozzy and Drix, which is where the lost media comes from.

The show has a repeating plot of Osmosis Jones and Drix trying to stop whatever virus, bacteria or other villain from causing havoc on the body they’re in. It was a pretty cool concept, and apparently popular enough in Japan to get It’s own manga.

The only issue with this is only one page has ever been found/posted online. I’ve got proof of the manga existing by one girl’s blog post from 2007, but besides that, these are the only images I've ever seen of its existence.

I’ve tried translating the title of the film and show into Japanese, which is what let me find the original image everyone talks about, and what the cover of the manga looks like.

All it says on the cover is “FILE 0-89’ with a picture of the main characters over it.

The person who owned the manga has been inactive since 2020 and I wasn’t able to contact her.

The person who bought it got it from Comiket, a convention in Tokyo Japan

I know using google translate isn’t the best method, but I don’t speak Japanese and I’m fully relying on google translate to find things about this, so if someone could translate it more accurately, that would be a great help too!!

If anyone has any information on this, it'd be the biggest help ever! Thank you!!",False,manga,1706034596.0,19dv7qj,

Looking manga where MC was having S rank adventurer power ?,"I remember this was isekai where MC was actually very strong but did not realized it. He was like 30 years old or maybe late 20. I remember he was trained by S rank adventurer party because MC want to become strong and protect the world.

He go to guild to become adventurer and need to get past examination.

I remember there is a scene where a drunk adventurer try to seduce receptionist, MC try to stop it and the drunk man try to beat MC back, but MC beat him easily. Turns out the drunk man was a problematic A rank adventurer that have criminal record of beating people.

There is also a dark elf girl who was MC friend and seems like a former S class adventurer. 

One examination , MC meet a snobby little noble kid who was arrogant and have B rank tier magic and show off to mc and insult mc for being 30 years old man and tell him he have no talent.

MC somehow beat him in sparring match and he cry to his older brother who was A rank. The older brother was one of examinee, and also a problematic. No one managed to pass his test to become adventurer , they need to spar with him , and he often beat the people that try to pass his test to half dead and heavily injured him. He also try to seduce the dark elf and want to make her as second wife, but she refused and tell MC was stronger than him.

MC then spar with him and beat him easily. I think he hold grudge and want to kill MC. He also have little sister that hate MC for beating two of his brother. MC later meet him in warrior city, the girl was a sword man, there MC fight with the champion that was kinda wearing lion fur, i kinda forgot.  MC beat him in hand to hand combat and become the new champion.

Can you help me find this?,"⚠️: I'll resume a lot, because there are some trigger stuff, so be warned.

Long time ago, I found a revenge manga, really cliché.
The story was about a teen girl that... her life went to hell, not literally but almost: her parents died (I think they killed themselves because of debts) and her sister ended up dying after being drugged for... not good reasons, at all.
She was broken to say at least, gone to an abandoned school to jump...
But found a boy dumping a body there.
They agreed on one thing after(of course) she freaked out, the boy was a fucking serial killer, but never killed a girl, he proposed to help her on taking revenge on the guys that made her life like that, if she let him kill her, she agreed.
The manga is cliché as hell, funny, and of course, there's some ecchi, but I have no idea how much because I don't remember it that well.
But...
One thing that I do remember: the manga has no ending, why? Because the writer died.
YES IT ENDED WITH NO ENDING.
I need to suffer all that again, but I can't find it anywhere.

The few things i remember are

1. People had no reaction to the MC turning male or female, apart from lusting for female version, else it was completely normal for them.
2. The male version would turn female after an orgasm
3. The female version would turn male after an orgasm, except there were circumstances she didn't.

New to manga,"I have been watching anime for a little over a decade . I’ve enjoyed every bit of it . But these days, everything I watch seems to be the same story recycled over and over . Nothing truly feels new anymore and as arrogant as it sounds, I feel like I’ve seen it all . I find myself constantly rewatching certain anime just to get that taste of a fresh, amazing, unique story . I’m not saying I’m giving up anime, but I think it’s time to pick up some manga 

I have never read any manga up until a few weeks ago when I decided to continue the chainsaw man series by picking up the manga where the anime dropped off. And It’s been a fun read . But now that I’ve finally dipped my toe into manga, I realize there are so many unique stories out there that hasn’t been animated yet. I feel like I have so many opportunities . I also finished book one of Goodnight PunPun. Another amazing series that is different from anything I’ve seen . 

Basically, I wanted to see if you guys could recommend a newbie like me some manga that has an amazing story . Is unique, and has had a lasting effect on you . I love stories that leave an impression . I’m open to anything . 

I wish I could give a specific genre but my taste is all over the place . Here are a few anime that I like that might give you an idea 

Now and Then, Here and There
Steins Gate 
Tokyo Ghoul + Parasyte the Maxim- (I love drastic character development) 
Kobayashi Maid Dragon 
March comes in like a Lion 
Re-Zero 
Wolf Children 
Silent Voice 
The Boy And The Beast 
Made in Abyss
The Girl who leapt through time 
Chainsaw Man 
The Evangelion Series
JJK


I wish I could name more but it would be a very long post . To highlight something, one particular thing I enjoy very much is seeing character development. I love seeing a bad guy turning good . Or a good guy turning bad . I love seeing a character that grows strong by going through pain and hardship (not through the power of friendship or some hidden ability they discover in them).

WARNING THIS IS GONNA BE SPOILERS FOR LITERALLY EVERYTHING I REMEMBER

>!i know that at the start the FL dressed up as a highschooler (both characters are adults tho) and when she was outside she ran into her step brother (ML). the ML hit on her and asked her out and she saw this as an opportunity to use him and humiliate him when they broke up. so they date and she tries to hold off on actually touching him or anything but they eventually kiss and shes still doing it under the guise of humiliating him. later on she tries to break it off but cares for him a bit now so she does it via saying shes moving away to another country with her grandma, he gets very upset and a little depressed and she (as his sister) sees hes not doing great with her gone so she as the gf tells him shes actually coming back to japan so hes not depressed. they eventually have sex (he still doesnt know its her) and at some point he finds out about it and they discover that when they were kids (when theyre parents were only dating i think?) they both kinda liked each other but were shy so eventually grew apart and thought the other hated them.!<

>!flashforward they go on a ski trip with their friends (i kind of want to say they went as siblings? theyre friends didnt know theyre dating yet?? BUT IT COULD BE THE OPPOSITE AND THEY WENT AS BF/GF NOT SIBLINGS), they have a cute moment but i dont remember it and yeah. they tell their parents about them dating and the parents take it suprisingly well and in the end they get engaged/married!<

Why is Scary Campus College University cancelled ?,"**Note**\- *I am following the example of one of the previous thread* [*https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/199ghus/why\_has\_legendary\_moonlight\_sculptor\_struggled/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/199ghus/why_has_legendary_moonlight_sculptor_struggled/) *in order to prevent this thread from being cancelled.* 

&#x200B;

Do you know the horror manga seinen manga by Close your eyes hoshino creator Nagashii Kouhei called Scary Campus College University ? It was about a college freshmen named Chigarashi Mahina, who wanted to live a university life, while dealing with supernatural elements that threaten her, which is when she seeks the help from a man named Kaoru Makube an expert in the supernatural to protect her.

The series is unique because it provides drama with horror elements that you read from various horror manga, especially where chapter deal with a ""monster of the week"" format where Mahina and Kaoru deal with a supernatural horror on Campus in each chapter/arc, the series in experimental with diversity like Chapter 30 which is a ""lower deck episode"" where the main characters are not in it as it is a standalone scary story but is still part of the series, chapter 62 And 63 which are the only chapters/arc that doesn’t contain the supernatural ""monster of the week"" but instead focuses on the real threat in society which is proven scary in real life ""scam artists"" where they trick people into giving them money and chapter 64 which has a minor appearance of the main character Kaoru but includes a new character who is also an expert in the supernatural.

Despite that, however, it was announced from Kouhei's Twitter account on 31st December 2023 [https://twitter.com/kohei\_nagashius/status/1741420772059750759](https://twitter.com/kohei_nagashius/status/1741420772059750759) that the series is cancelled, and it will end next week, and it was a shame too because it was a mixture of drama and scary elements, and that Kouhei did handle horror, if the series continued, we could have explored Mahina attending her 3rd and final year of university while dealing with dangerous supernatural threat while understand which supernatural creatures are good and bad and if there are some humans who are evil like the supernatural monsters, we could have been introduced to another supernatural specialist from chapter 64 and a final arc where Karou and Chigarashi along with their allies will prepare for their final battle against Kaoru’s old master who is about to unleash something terrifying to the whole world.

So in this thread we need to discuss few thingslike 

why is Scary Campus College University  cancelled, was it due to the low sales of the volumes or something?

Can Nagashii Kouhei continue to do horror like he did with Scary Campus College University with dark horror story anthology series much like most horror mangaka like Junji Itou did, or since he is good at female designs, perhaps another genre like maybe school life harem series or maybe an isekai harem manga series since well the isekai genre is popular, and he is good at fanservice with the girls.",False,manga,1706101081.0,19eghwa,

about having a good memory and oneshots,"i was scrolling through youtube shorts and i saw a video of guys trying to remember 3 characters with some specific characteristic in 5 seconds, for example, name 3 characters with red hair, etc etc etc.  


seeing these videos i think that i can barely remember any name of characters of the majority of mangas i've read, and sometimes i think about it and i kinda feel sad but at the same time i can't understand how can someone remember the name of so many characters.  


I ve used characters as examples but i can't really remember well some(most) parts of the story too. Actually i've read 575 mangas, being 236 of them oneshots, but obviously i don't expect to remember each one of them, but i like to think that i just remember those i like the most, and the most i like, more i remember. I'm really impressed when i see someone talking about several animes and mangas and remembering everything.  


also, i've observed something kinda obvious but i remember much more mangas with more chapters than just oneshots, and not because they are short, because i remember some of them, but i think that not every author handles well this type of manga. and with this i think the most time you spend reading something regardless of how long it is, you will relate more to it.  


maybe just some obvious stuff  but I felt like I had to say it for my own sake. Sorry if it was a bit repetitive, I'm bad at being objective.",False,manga,1706096611.0,19ef7i6,

Looking for a manga (VERY vague description),"I'm looking for a manga that I read once AGES ago. I don't remember much about it, so this is gonna be very vague and it's okay if no one can recognize it from this, but thought I'd give it a shot. Been wondering for a long time.

The setting was some sort of Magic School? The main character (I think) was a girl with twin tails (hair might have been red or reddish). The only other character I remember was this glasses-wearing dude (blonde?) who was maybe bullying her or just didn't like her for some reason, they were like rivals or enemies? He was very good with Magic Stuff, and she might not have been at first.

The Magic School had a Magic Tournament/Competition of some sort, and I remember Main Girl and Glasses Guy had to team up at some point and became friends and/or fell in love during it. Or started falling in love. Maybe. But I never got to see if they ended up together, because I guess the manga wasn't updated and then I lost it.

When I say I read it ages ago, I mean it could've been at any point between 2007-2015. Art style was not too detailed/mature, so honestly the characters could've been anything from elementary schoolers to high schoolers?

If anyone has any idea what this could be, I would love to hear about it. I just want to know if those two ended up together or not, lol.",False,manga,1706094831.0,19eequ2,

then he bring that one to a race, the car was too impatient, it went off the track and hit with the wall or something and got a notch on the hood, but when it went off track it left a big mark.

(i’m not confident in the part after this but) the one racing with him thought that car was amazing and give him the winner sticker, now he’s a champion and ppl came to challenge him.

1. I was reading it on MangaDex so it is (or was) uploaded there
2. The art style is kind of chibi-ish, but every character is an adult
3. The premise is that there was a high school reunion, I think? But suddenly something paranormal happened and a group of the attendees were sealed in the old school, kind of like isekai I guess. It was a group of 1 man and maybe 4 or 5 women. They had to survive so they used the school's resources to grow their own food and each person had different roles, but the man was treated worse than everyone else. He secretly had a sexual relationship with one of the women (she had pigtails or braids and glasses, basically looked like a quiet shy girl) who convinced him to kind of use sex to gain control of the whole group eventually or something like that.

Finding a specific manga/manhua/webnovel I forgot the name of,"Hey. Around one or two years ago I read a manga, manhua or webnovel. I tend to manhua, but I'm not sure. The setting is the typical ""world turns into a game with a game like system"". The MC returns from the future, so he knows about what will happen and about how to survive the tasks that will come.

The story starts shortly before new year's eve. It's the modern world somewhere in Asia (south Korea probably) in a big city with skyscrapers. It's snowing. Classmates of the MC try to bully him (if I remember correctly, they go a bit overboard with it, or at least try to). But MC with his knowledge and skills from his past life can defeat them easily. At exactly 00:00 (the people and the talk show/news show that is shown from time to time counts it down from ten to zero), the world transforms. Every human receives a status window with a message and the ""games"" start. People are locked at the places they are in right now, some kind of invisible barriers divide the areas into smaller parts and each part has it's own survival game. Many people die, because the tasks are mostly very hard and include some kind of monsters. The MC is more of an anti hero. His own survival is more important to him than that of others and he even tries to use other humans to his advantage, to make himself stronger, even at the cost of them dying.

Land is granted to him and he travels to a rural village to be the new lord. Along the way he meets and befriends a merchant who becomes his trusted advisor. He develops the village/country by using his exp boost skill for all the villagers. 

He trains the villagers to use weapons that suit their natural ability, like lumberjacks as Frontline warriors, pearl diver as an archer. He forms them into groups and teaches battle strategy. 

He brings them to farm monsters in different areas and raises money and their strength quickly due to the boost. He allies with neighboring nations, I remember there was a ninja type country and maybe one that built ships.

I made this post a year ago, however still no one was able to tell me what the title of the manga is. 


The manga was about a blue bird humanoid and red humanoid snake’s child and bird/ eagles. The blue bird has the ability to give Immortality(which the golden bird tried to force him to give him immortality but the blue bird declined and flee) to one person, which he given it to the red snake(his lover) due to her almost dying during child birth.   The eagle/bird relationship with the snakes was enemy and the eagle/bird guards cut off the red snake’s head(she didn’t die cause she was immortal). Her lover’s body was stolen by the villain of the story(something about a gold bird) but her child was able to escape due to the other snake citizens escaping and the child live on earth.   Also the gold bird’s original body was extremely weak, so he used the blue bird’s body. The daughter grew up, they were going to high school or college(forgotten)they always kept their hair short but their power started to show and their hair always grew super long. They also met with a boy that was in a eagle/bird tribe, the boy did tried to kill her that was before they became friends and they helped one another.   If I’m correct, the blue bird was injured when the red snake female first met him and the red snake helped him and they get to know each other. That time the snake tribe gotten a disease and tons of people were dying cause of it, the red snake was also one of the third most beautiful snakes of the tribe. The red snake was willing to risk her life to find the flower that was able to save her tribe.   That is currently what I remembered, if someone know the name of that manga please tell me.

Searching for a recent Iseki Manga I forgot to save to my Bookmark bar.,"It is an Iseki about this person dying and being born on the borderlands of a Kingdom.  His father is a minor knight and not much happens other than growing up and info about the village.  Finally, a rep of the King shows up and tells the father that a massive monster was spotted in the forest.  They leave, the boy and father continue on managing the village, with the father going out at night trying to find this giant beast. Eventually the father doesn't come home one night so the mother and boy venture out and find him beat up slumped against a tree.  The beast shows up, boy tells mother to take father to house, and he fights the monster.  He kills it with the last of his strength and passes out next to the monster.  Eventually the Kings knights show up and find the boy.  A bit later the boy finds a girl waiting at the gates of the village, they fight a duel, the boy wins, and we learn she is the princess.  Eventually he decides he wants to go to the Academy,,,,, That is how far I have gotten.

[Recommendation] It's hard for me to detect a quality Action Manga,"Dear Community.

I need some help finding a good action manga(Manhwa is also welcome). I looked into the TOP 50 manga list on MAL but I still want your opinion on what to read.

Recently I started reading Tokyo Ghoul (Watched the Anime in the past) and I like the ""unique"" story and the characters. 

What I desire:

\- The MC (Male or Female) is weak and he/she is getting stronger (Read as character development)

\- No ""medieval"" setting (Berserk, Vagabond, Vinland Saga...)

\- No magic as magic circles (I just can't)

\- No unnecessary ""Ecchi"" (Fighting for titi\*\*s...)

\- At least over 150 chapters

\- No Anime adaptation (Not necessary)

\- If possible modern world (Also not necessary)

\- No mecha, space, mystery 

\- No isekai (Well, only if it's good) (Have read: Solo Leveling - but didn't like it too much)

I don't want to make the list too long. So feel free to recommend me something (My Manga list on MAL is quite ""small""). 

I like the world of Tokyo Ghoul. But I'm open to more. Even better if the manga is ""a hidden gem""

Thank you very much!

After my reread, I now wholeheartedly believe that Fukubei was never real. Fukubei was just a personality that Katsumata made up as a child. I think this ties into why Friend always wears masks.

Immersive Manga Recommendations,"Now, this might be a bit too specific and vague of a recommendation request, but I'm looking for a manga to get lost in.

Recently I've been feeling kind of down and bored all the time, and because of winter I'm not leaving my house as much, so I find myself just doing nothing for most of the day. To counter this boredom, I'd love to find a series that I could get lost in. Ideally, I'd like a bit of a longer series (but not too long, 30 volumes max), with characters that I'd fall in love with, a cool world, an engrossing plot, and action would be nice as well, but it's not a must. And since I'm kind of impatient, if the manga can hook me from the very start, that would be even better.

For reference here are some series that I've already seen and think fit this criteria:

\- Hunter x Hunter

\- Magi

\- Mushoku Tensei

\- One Piece

\- Golden Kamuy

\- Fullmetal Alchemist

but I've been re-reading some older series, and picking up a new one and I know I'm gonna eat through it faster than expected. Liar's Game, a Psycho Drama Mystery that honestly I didn't think i'd enjoy, but I am.   


I like smart characters. I like character growth. I like the game of chess in the heads of people. I also like games in general, where cards, dice, and a board game are made nefarious due to the stakes involved.   


So I come to you looking for recs. 

I've read or at least looked into the following. 

Death Note - Meh, It was good, but I would have liked less Kira. 

KAKEGURUI - Dear lord I tried to like this. I stuck with it for a while but when extended family got involved I stopped. There's only so much suspension of disbelief I can take before it becomes contrived. 

Kaiji - I started it a ways back, dropped because idk. Should I pick it up again? Is it worth? 

The World is Money and Power - Started good, and it suffered the fate of many of its kind. It started focusing more on the side characters BS and not actually doing shit with the plot. Got board after MC disappeared for 5+ chapters. 

??? Game? - I cant remember what it was, but there was a story about a guy who went into a game with a bunch of other people and if their heart rate went too high they would die? And there was a lot of psychological warfare going on... Cant remember the name, but I would like to read it again. 

No Game No Life - Too far in the wrong direction. I have no feeling of stakes in any of these games, and the MCs are both creepy af. 

Battle Royal - Its an artifact of its time. Hard for me to read now. Good ideas, but implemented in what feels like shock value. 

???? Game? 2 - Another one I read and cant remember. A lot of people are suddenly sucked into a ""Game"" world and have to do things to stay alive. Gets really heavy really fast with disturbing characters. MC starts off ""nice"" but then you find out it was an act and he's REALLY twisted. Can't remember the name, would like to revisit.

An Adult Love Story : Tonari no Aki to wa Kakawaranai,"I found this very interesting. This story takes a look at the assumptions we make about others feelings and the lies we tell in social situations. It looks at how misunderstandings can hurt and shape us.

Uzuki isn't a beauty, wasn't popular in highschool and has a bad attitude when it comes to handsome men. In highschool she was close friends with the most popular and handsome boy in her school. After a misunderstanding they grew apart. 10 years later she has a new neighbor, none other than Aki, who is still as handsome and popular as ever and who still wants to be close to her.

He is dealing with his own baggage which I don't want to give spoilers away here. A short love story of only 14 chapters about highschool friends given a second chance by fate, a simple grounded love story, give it a try.

There is also a cat.

[HELP] [Manga name search],"The manga is about the Romance of Three Kingdoms,  mainly telling the story about Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Liu Bei   

The volume starts like this:   

A city was destroyed by the Yellow Turban army, and this kid (I  forgot if it's Guan Yu or Zhang Fei) get separated from his parents when  they were trying to flee. He then wander around the area and then ,  Guan Yu met Zhang Fei meets each other. While the first kid is a bit  oblivious of how the world of the poor works, the other one is adept to  it, it can be seen when he prohibits them to give their hard-earned  bread to the homeless. The first kid gives it nonetheless, and tomorrow  morning they see the corpse of the homeless guy.   

Fast forward, both of them try to get into the army, and that's  where they meet Liu Bei. After showing impressive prowess in a small  scale war, they get promoted. One morning, they go with Liu Bei to  prevent the Yellow Turban Army from attacking their nation(?). They  learned how to ride a horse from Liu Bei on their way. The volume ends  with them succeed in destroying the bridge but several Yellow Turban  forces managed to cross.

[SL] (Request) Miss Kiryu Doesn't Understand Love,"Summary:

""32-year-old Futaba Kiryu is a manga artist that writes for a weekly shounen magazine. Her latest ongoing manga is a romantic comedy, ""Bocchi no Ore kara Riaju no Omaera ni Ittoku"" (A Loner Like Me's Got a Lot to Say about You Normies out There) or ""Bottoku"" for short. It is a best-seller and has an anime adaption on the works. But the truth is, she's completely clueless about romance.

The days go on as she continues on working on her manga with her manga assistants, but soon, one of her assistants, Hiro Asakura (she dubs him as ""Assassin"" because of his cold and intimidating demeanor), and the anime scriptwriter for the ""Bottoku"" anime, Kitamura Kyosuke (social media dubs him ""The Tactician"" for his notoriously clever execution in the anime he's worked in) grow an interest in her and eventually make a move on her. How will Futaba fare in this love triangle when her knowledge of romance is next to nothing?""

I noticed this manga hasn't been translated in almost a year, and currently 51 out of 54 chapters have been translated. I'm hoping that this post can help bring attention back to it so either the previous translation group could have it brought to their attention to finish it or a new interested group could finish it if the translation was dropped completely.

What is your top 5 for each of these genres ? (Shonen/Seinen/Shoujo/Horror),Am looking for recommendations for these genres in particular and also for a good discussion with y'all so that's pretty much it. Can't wait to see what y'all have to offer.,False,manga,1706713870.0,1afk0wo,
Rose Garten Saga is one of the most entertaining and enjoyable reads I've ever had with manga. [100% Recommend],"For full context, I had no idea what this manga was. No one recommended it to me, I've never heard of this title before, I was just casually browsing manga for some spice and saw it as one of the suggested entries. 

I didn't read the synopsis or ANYTHING. And I... honestly believe that's the best way to experience the manga. I don't even want to give any sort of plot synopsis because I think it's just that important to go in blind. The only thing I guess I should prefix is that this is something I recommend to people **at least 15 and above (PLEASE NOTE)**. Also it's an ""action"" centric manga. 

From the first chapter, I KNEW this was going to be special. There was a certain hook to it that just left my jaw on the floor with how out of left field it was. I didn't expect the Plot and ""Plot"" to go that hard. I can't really show any of my favourite panels here, but holy shit the art is God tier as well. I can very easily see why it didn't explode like other manga, but man... this thing underappreciated as hell.

This gave me the feeling I wished I got from Records of Ragnarök. I go over more of my thoughts in depth [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/1597wze/im_disappointed_with_records_of_ragnarok_manga/). But essentially I felt like Records of Ragnarok felt like it underutilized some amazing concepts with its story, opting instead to go for the safer 'brawl' approach to a lot of the fights. While RGS isn't really meant to be like ROR aside from a key concept, I feel it just handled the concept in a far more creative way. And it led into some breathtaking fights with art and paneling that can go toe-to-toe with ROR (I feel like ROR's Art is what truly elevates it to breathtaking heights). The choreography and ideas for match ups feels endless and the dynamics go absolutely insane. 57 chapters in and it still  feels like there's SO much more this manga has to offer.

I really... REALLY want to post some of my favourite panels here because they are drawn beautifully, but anyone who's read it I'm sure can understand why I can't really do that aside from the spoiler stuff. 

The cast is also very diverse in the sense that we get all kinds of people in both ethnicities and abilities that make sense in the context of what their characters represent. 

Also, the comedy here is hilarious. I felt so many things while reading this, but the last thing I expected (aside from the action) was how genius the comedy is. This manga has a trait to it that could've been so easily used for cheap 'shots' and low hanging fanservice, but the way they integrate it into both the plot and the characters makes it inseparable from the story itself. 

People who have read this knows I'm leaving out or trying to dodge what that *main thing* is, but I just can't forget how I felt reading that first chapter and getting slapped with a certain scene with an old man. Going into it blind imo is 100% the best way to experience it.

I know the MC and a following character ( if I'm not wrong a blonde teenager ) stole a motorcycle then hid in the mountains, the MC left him behind near a river and ran away to a nearby village where he was taken in by some grandma for a while.  


That is the only events I remember and the only description of the manga that I am able to provide, I hope someone knows which manga it is and is able to provide a name cause I'm dying to read it again.",False,manga,1706696510.0,1afer99,Ajin

\- I'm around 85% sure MC was female.

\- She was a member of royal family, however they were rebelled against due to terrible way of running the country and all her family members were killed (including her). 

\- She was reborn into a normal person (think she ended up being a maid working in the castle).

\- The new ruler is the leader of rebellion. I believe they knew each other and he feels guilty?

\- The new ruler kept most of her old employees working in the castle and they all recognise and respect her.

Title of an old unfinished isekai manga,"Hello, good morning.

I'm looking for an old incomplete manga, and I'll do my best to describe what I remember of it.

It's about a girl who somehow lands in a fantasy world, sort of Escaflowne style. I think she wears pajamas throughout the manga. At the beginning, she shows up in the fantasy world and, I don't know if she gets attacked or something, but she's saved by a centaur who's like a faun. Then, there's a chat - maybe around a campfire - and suddenly she's spied on by an evil wizard or sorcerer from another side of the world.

In the last vignette of the manga, she is about to cross a bridge to meet someone who was supposed to help her.

The manga was left hanging, with only three or a handful of chapters, as far as I remember. What caught my attention most were the illustrations, very detailed and well-drawn. I was curious, and when I tried to find the author, it turned out that he had passed away, which probably explains why the manga was never finished. At the time, in the wiki it said that he drew manga for adults, before doing this manga.",False,manga,1706648691.0,1aezbqs,

	2.	Romantic Subplots: A good romance subplot that doesn’t overpower the main action theme but adds depth to the story.
	3.	No Hentai: I’m not interested in hentai manga, so please keep the recommendations hentai-free.
	4.	Moderate NSFW Content is Fine: Some NSFW content is okay, but I’d prefer it not to be the main focus.

and the offer was. well... sex, cook and keeping the house clean   
at the some point in the manga, some soldiers did came to them asking the former soldier if they had seen the woman, but he killed them 

i think it had a happy ending and was also oneshot

another reason why the former soldier killed them

It’s a bit of a comedy and the girl cannot take no for an answer. She ends up leaving her school for prestigious rich girls to go to school with him and uses her money to bend the rules to get closer to him. The series I believe is finished (no longer releasing).

She was brought back to that time ( before her face got burned) she struck up a deal with the male lead to marry him. And she used her previous life's knowledge to help him get ahead in his family. ( like finding the land where a priest who got murdered, was buried.

"[REC] Isekai/transmigration that deals with the erasure of the ""host"" person/identity?","Of course, in some stories this is irrelevant, either because they reincarnate as a baby, or into a host that died.

But for the large number of stories in which the protagonist is transmigrated/reincarnated into an already existing person, most seem to just ignore the fact that the previous identity of the body just got essentially erased.

So, are there any good stories where this aspect is properly engaged with in the story? I've found a couple that are in this vein: *The One Within the Villainess*, and *My Body Has Been Possessed By Someone*.

But these are more where the other identity still exists. Are there any that deal with the consequences of an entire identity fully being erased, and replaced? I'd imagine it would be pretty hard finding out one of your loved ones has essentially died, and been replaced by some stranger.

jujutsu kaisen message to the idea of Heroic / Ultimate Sacrifices as a concept.,"Almost every week we get the same rant. My favorite character dies this chapter. Gege is a terrible writer with a mid-level manga. 

Don't you guys understand the meaning of the characters deaths.  You don't understand the series and the message it's trying to bring that's why you're so disappointed. 

 the message is short answer don't throw everything away for quick and easy wins. instead face the hard challenges life bring you and try your best to overcome even when you lose sometimes that just the only you can become stronger. 

You can see with Megumi talk with Gojo after the baseball game. Dying to win and risking your life to win are not the same thing. Jujutsu Kaisen really is opposite to the idea of Heroic / Ultimate Sacrifices as a concept, really.

That is why Megumi's obsession with Mahoraga was a flaw. People die, but they should die trying their best rather that resigning themselves.  Gojo literally told Megumi that's relying on his truck card is a crotch because always thinking that he can win from it prevent him from trying other ways of getting stronger.   

The characters who reach their true potential and succeed the most in the narrative are the ones who were risking their lives to become stronger while the ones dying to win achieve almost nothing. 

Example Yuki Tsukumo and Fumihiko Takaba  vs Kenjaku.

During Yuki and kenjack fight Kenjaku  scolded her for fighting with no real self-confidence by not using her domain because she think she lose in a domain battle. Even when she pushes to defeat, she still never uses her domain instead on a suicide attack on him. Kenjaku even said she was really boring.

 Now with Fumihiko he was being deconstruction by Kenjaku for being a half ass Comedian and kenjaku was a better comedian then Fumihiko is. Fumihiko was losing confidence in himself because he knew kenjaku was right, his CT wasn't working anymore which was link to his confidence, and he was being pushed in defeat but then Fumihiko dogged deep inside and realizing why he become a comedian.  

Regain his confidence and his CT and told Kenjaku that he was going to give it his all to Kenjaku his audience! Fumihiko was going to Kenjaku laughs so hard he going to puka his guts out and shocking Fumihiko end up winning and making kenjaku enjoy himself in years.

Their fights is a great parallel both lose confidence in themselves both he different is Fumihiko regain his but Yuki didn't. ",False,manga,1706558225.0,1ae4ixm,

Looking for a manga I once read,"Series was found thank you! The Dreaming/OEL

So I don’t remember much about this manga. 

I think it was a horror genre manga? But the premise is that two twin sisters get sent to a boarding school (I think maybe their mum went there? And it might be haunted?) but the headmistress doesn’t accept twins because of some superstition, so they have to pretend to be ordinary sisters and the students warn them not to let others find out. 🤔

I'm not sure if I'll be able to find it because the part I read was very little and it's been a long time, but it can't hurt to try, right?

&#x200B;

There was a male main character. If I remember correctly, something happens to him and someone summons the main character to a Japanese-style pavilion or something. And then there's a woman in the mansion, she's a very calm talking type, and she's telling the main character what's going on, I think.

Where the characters actually feel real and not some classic anime trope, and the romance doesn't take a whole season just to confess their love or something.

I just got finished reading the latest chapter (96) and I desperately want something similar to mushoku tensei. The MC is overpowered but at least it feels earned and hes still not the strongest in that world either. He still needs to be cautious that he doesn't make a mistake or he could die. And he isn't some amazing hero who can solve every problem. Nor do the women just magically fall in love after looking at him for a second.

Young girl is born in a Celtic village with black hair, this isn't normal and a sign of druidic potential (everyone else has light hair), she's apprenticed to the local magic dude. 
From here I'm not sure of the order... I know she is captured and enslaved by Romans at one point, travels through the Fae realm, is trained as a fighter by a bunch of Celtic warrior women and eventually defeats this big bad guy who's mother is a bad druid (?). I think she also has some spirits that are contracted to her or just help her. And there's a scene where a unicorn protects her from the big bad guy and dies after being tainted.

I'm trying to find a psychological manga where the mc is the heir to some old rich family with a spooky history in the countryside.,"So the plot of the manga isn't too original but I read it when I was getting into manga and I could not remember what the title was. I read it back when KissManga was a thing. I always wanted to find it so I can finish it because it has an interesting mystery element to it and the main character seems to loath his family but for some reason he still returned and becomes the next heir of that family. It was the type of old samurai families that had some long curse or magic they pass on to the next family head and the main character is uncovering what the family mystery is. One thing I remembered about it is that the house has a maid and she's an illegitimate child of the previous head of the family and so she serves as a maid and concubine to the mc (they do end up actually sleeping together so there is some incest in it).

Last time I read it was back in 2015 and it's quite hard to find in the Web cos of how it's not that unique so I'm not sure if many people may know of it.",False,manga,1706498845.0,1adlf0f,Amnesia Labyrinth

Note 1: For the record I don't mind if they have sex, but I would prefer that they either develop their bond first or get married first before they ""bone"" each other.

Note 2: I don’t mind LGBTQ couples so long as they are respectful and don’t perpetrate any bad stereotypes.

Looking for a manga title maybe a shojo manga,"
Looking for the name of a manga that I read awhile ago. The things I remember from it are the Male mc and the fmc both go to the same high school. They both have what I would call guardian spirits. They both feel a connection to each other. Eventually the male mc starts to have dreams about his past life back in feudal japan where he was I think a commoner and the fmc was a priestess or something that had bells in her hair. Anyway I think they talk to the fmc and her spirit about it and the spirit who was her bodyguard in the past starts to actively try to keep them apart so they don’t fall in love again like in the past. There is also a scene where he goes back to the family shrine or something at the graveyard I believe during a school breakand his helping clean up and he trying to find out stuff about the past and finds a box with one of the bells that the fmcs past self gave his past self as a declaration of love before he had to go to war. Also the priest or whatever says he can have them because he’s the only one who’s ever been able to open them or something and he is destined for them. After that for the towns celebration the fmc is chosen to play her past self and the bells resonate revealing the past scene of him coming back from the war to find the fmc’s past selves house on fire and his past self tries to rescue her and find her by shouting her and also perishes I think. It’s also revealed that the mcs spirit was also one of his former friends. They come back to the present where they are doing a reenactment of the fire and starts shouting the girls name and I believe the bells resonate agin or something. I think it’s also revealed that some of their other friends also had past lives that were involved in theirs in some shape or form.",False,manga,1706490040.0,1adiglp,

The reason for this thread's existence is the fact that both requests and suggestions became kind of stale. It's supposed to bring out more manga that is not RTed or recommended. Also, it's quite useful for the discussion of not so current titles.

Also, not a rule or any kind of criticism, the more interesting part is not the list of the stuff you read, but your impressions of it.

"Searching for a Manga with Gangs and Rivals, any help appreciated!","Hello :),

I'm having a bit of a nostalgic  moment and there's this particular manga that I remember from about a  decade ago which has been stuck in my mind. This post might  sound a bit weird, but I was hoping if anyone here could help me recall  the name of this manga, since I've been wanting to revisit it.

The  manga was mainly centered around gangs and rivalries. There was this  particularly strong main character who was admired and sought after by  all gangs because of his strength. Despite their constant efforts, he  always turned down their offers to join any gang. The character was a ""lone wolf"" and didn't like talking to anyone.

Additionally,  there's this one scene that was especially emotional. It involved a girl who was being severely bullied by  another group of girls. The bullies dubiously made her eat an orange  peel.

It was a quite  fascinating manga and still holds a special place in my heart, but it's  extremely frustrating that I can't remember its name. I’ve been  searching for a while now but with no luck. If these details ring a bell  to anyone, your help would be greatly appreciated.

Problem with video-game manga,"There  are many different manga/manhwa or whatever with some kind of  ""leveling""-system in them. I understand that a self-insert protagonist  in a power-fantasy using a ""magic/skill-system"" most people are familiar  to through games is a combination that sounds like instant success...  But I am sick of it!

There are  sooo many manga where the author do the absolute minimum to the point  where it is embarrassing... The biggest difference between manga and  video-games is that video-games are interactive. I know this is  obvious... but you know what is also obvious? That the UI of video-games  is made frustrating as little as possible. The result of this is often  an oversimplification that would make no sense in reality.

Good examples for such an oversimplification is the use of stats:  
In  most games you normally want to know as much as possible, but don't  want to do any math or anything like that. As a result you can normally  look at a melee weapon and see the damage(and sometimes even your  attack-speed/weapon weight) it does being visualized as a number... This  whole thing normally depends on the game, but let's talk about the  laziest approach to this: this number is your damage that gets directly  multiplied/added to your strength stat and its speed is a flat number.

This  makes sense for a game and is easy to understand for the player and  relatively easy to integrate in a rpg-game as a developer... but this is  only excusable because of the gameplay aspect... What do I mean by  that? Welp... Let's take oversimplified concepts and combine them with  reality and see what happens...

1.:  In reality if you punch something only two factors matter about the  force of the punch: your weight and how ""fast you can get your fist to  move"".(F=ma) How would you get more force behind your fist? Welp... you  would need to accelerate your fist even faster then before. In game you  would invest points in strength. But if you try to combine these two  things... there suddenly exists a problem... why? Because acceleration  or speed is bound to the agility stat under normal circumstance... So  how would you increasing your strength reflect in reality? Would your  fist get heavier? Would the MCs mass get big enough to get its own  gravity field over the course of the story?

2.:  Energy... Where does it come from? Where does it go? If someone can  move a whole building by simply ground pounding your m...ansion how much  would this person need to eat?

3.:  How does the character hold back? How would old technology like a phone  not get turned to dust by a guy capable of bench-pressing mars, when I  struggle to not get covered in egg-juice when cooking?

This all is just lazy writing... but to be honest this is still bearable. It becomes unbearable the moment this happens tho:

FLAT  FUCKING CHARACTERs... This is a problem with manga outside of  video-game manga, but it feels it is especially true for them(, maybe  because of the MC that is so often just a self-insert character...)

Shortcuts...  If you have something setting your main character apart from the  rest... why the fuck is it luck of all things? And then this luck is to  be seen as some kind of achievement? WTF? Oh, this guy is so  incredible... He beat a lvl. 100000+ as lvl. 0.5 with a cool dagger  shooting half naked mermaids in golden armor... in half a hit... while  trying hard not to fart because he has explosive diarrhea...(the last  part only exists because the author thinks he needs some kind of  tension...)

If you can't make a  genius protagonist... ok, but don't make it so, that every else is a  moron that cooks their diner in their chamber pot...

This  would be all I can think of right now... Summarized the biggest problem  with video-game manga/comics in general is the lack of scale, effort  and sense... There are good ones like ""Survival Story Of A Sword King In  A Fantasy World"", ""Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken"" ""Kumo Desu ga, Nani  ka"" and so on, but those really are like diamonds in a pile of shit: You  can see them, pick them out and admire them for what they are, but the  stench just doesn't disappear...

Mangas with villains similar to the Inuyasha's ones.,"Let me explain a bit about my question.

In anime and manga, we normally see two types of villains.
Or it's the same villain from the beginning until the end, or we have a big villain for each arc, and in the second case sometimes the villain returns as an ally or something similar (Vegeta, for example).

But on Inuyasha, we have an approach closer to what we see in comics.
Naraku, Seshomaru and Kikyo are villains that come and back for multiple arcs, and sometimes those arcs are even self-contained.

There are more examples of manga like that? Note, that I'm not talking about something like Itachi. Despite his coming back from another arc, Akatsuki's saga is a rush down and his earlier appearance acts like a preview.",False,manga,1706458914.0,1ad6b7c,The plural of manga is manga.

Can you help me find the title of this manga?,"I've read this years ago and I just suddenly had a photographic memory of the cover so I wanted to check on it again.

It is about a high school boy, who has a weird/boring personality (as seen by his classmates). The manga's genre is comedy, school life, and I guess slice of life since it tackles about his daily life. Speaking about his daily lives, he is part of a baseball team, also has a hobby of watching rakugo, and he seems to have no friends at the start. Then I remembered, romance was not really its main focus but I think there was a girl who came to like him when she got to become somewhat friends with him but it happened wayy later in the story. I think what I really liked about the protagonist is his super straightforward and serious personality that most of the time I find very funny.

So that's the gist of the manga. Can someone help me?? I just badly want to read it again but I really can't find it even on the reading history of a manga site that I frequently visit.",False,manga,1706452814.0,1ad42gp,

Isekai where MC not OP but survive because of that ?,"I remember this isekai that mc was just normal high school boy.

I think all of them die in bus accident in field trip. They then went into another world , the goddess tell them to go into guild and become adventurer.

There are many people from mc world like from another school that die, got transported like mc.

MC did not have any good skills, all his classmate then went separate way forming party and mc was left alone. I remember MC was transported late, so all his classmate already gone because they got transported earlier than him.

MC then decided to survive with his trash skills, meet with his former classmate, a fat boy who now become merchant. He seems was mc friend, the fat boy also talentless like mc and left alone.

Later he found out his abilities was not suited for combat, but was amazing as merchant. He then help mc and he tell mc, majority of their classmate already die after being adventurer.

MC was shocked because most of them get good skills right ? the fat boy then told mc, good skills does not mean easy adventure. There are many adventurer overestimating themselves, delve into dangerous dungeon without any preperation and wiped, there are adventurer that cannot withstand the pain and injury when they fight monsters and die. Basically he told mc all adventurer was normal school students, they don't have experience , cannot handle the horror of death, and any painful/injury when fighting monsters.

The fat boy then tell MC have strong mental power, mc also very careful person and slowly climb his way rather than rushing it, and that's why he managed to survive this long. After that mc bide the fat boy farewell for another adventure.

I remember he later save a goddess that was sealed in the shrine, she was deemed as evil god or something like that, while the goddess say she was not evil god, she kinda lose the war against other god and sealed. The goddess was weak and decided to stick with MC and tell him, if he become her servant and worship her, slowly she can regain power and ask MC to find many people to worship her.

I think MC agree because the goddess give MC some blessing, it was kinda weak blessing but will become stronger when MC helped the goddess find people to worship her and spread her name.

Anyone know the name ?

Looking for a manga with multi world isekai,"The story of the first couple of chapters goes something like this:

There's a dude who gets isekaid to three different worlds - I don't remember if he loops between them involuntarily or voluntarily, but he somehow travels between them.

One world is a fantasy world, has a dragon that's terrorizing the people, and a holy sword in a stone for a hero to pull out.

One world is a sci-fi world, with advanced tech like laser guns and teleporters, and has a meteor heading towards the planet about to destroy it.

One world is probably a fantasy, has an evil wizard who has an unbreakable defence and wants a strong challenger to face him, if not he'll do something evil (i think)

The main character resolves the conflicts by >! taking a laser gun from world 2, killing the dragon with it, removing the sword from the stone by holding him and teleporting himself to the side using a teleporter from world 2. Taking the evil wizard to the world 2, and making him use his defence to block the meteor, then attacking him with the sword. !<",False,manga,1706450143.0,1ad369s,

Just finished the boxer and hot damn the music in that last fight was amazing....,"The boxer is a webtoon manwha/manga I started reading a while back and thought I figured I'd give it a try since most people kept recommending it to me. Gotta say this, I really enjoyed the story quite a bit. All the battles, character arcs, and how the coach developed was really dope. 


I gotta say the music in the boxer was really good. I've seen some webtoons do this more and more and I'd love for manga to have music and voice acting if they wanted. Honestly I think it'd be a really good implementation and the option to remove it simply if people wanna read it at their pace instead of playing catch up could be a really good option. People that wanna enjoy it with voice acting and music, here you go. People that wanna enjoy it with music, here you go. People that wanna enjoy it with their own music and just wanna read, here you go. Etc etc etc. I also think stuff such as audiobooks could help elevate manga in the music and voice acting department. Manga I feel has soo much untapped potential I'd love to see it grow. Within a physical medium and online. 


Anyways, all of this is to say, read the boxer. The manga feels like an anime with the song that played in the ending and the pacing is extremely solid. Heavily recommend it at least for the action.

In his journey, he found out the ugly nature of his ennemies and the hidden horrors they had done :

\- One wiped out an entire village because people rooted for the MC and his companions. He remembers about a young boy but when he came back to the village, everything was destroyed and he found a trace of what belonged to the child.

Need Help Finding a Manwha (completed short story about a girl learning the love of family),"I desperately need help finding a manwha about a girl who felt ignored and left out in her own family. I believe the beginning of the manwha started with the family engrossed in their daily routines and the MC felt a lack of love. I’m not too clear on the details, but I know the main protagonist had time away (either started living in another person’s body or was isekai’d to a different life scenario). The MC was later reunited with her real family and learned how much they love her and how much she loves her family as well. 

The most distinctive information I know is that it is a VERY short webtoon (less than 10-15 chapters), set in modern time Seoul, and it was so unbelievably heart jerking. I believe the MC had a little brother as well. 

I am so sorry I don’t have many details on it. It was the only webtoon that ever made me cry and I’d love to reread it after 2-3 years. I really appreciate any help!!",False,manga,1706410265.0,1acscze,

Forgotten Title: Mc goes back in time? Or transmitigates? I think it was chinese or had dark arts sort of style,"(I posted this on noveltranslations because I'm not sure if it's a novel or a manga)I posted here because there are a lot more mangas and there was a time when I read a lot of them so the number is 2 big for me to find by myself

So this might be a manga instead of a novel with how I remember stories, so I might be completly wrong, all I remember was the MC woke up and went hunting people he knew were strong, and he had some sort of dark arts power I thought it was necromancy but I can't seem to find it if its that.

This is from ""Kill The Hero"", I thought it might be this because of the mask I remember the MC had a mask that he used to hide his face when he went to hunt right after coming back, thats why I think it might be a manga maybe someone know art like this?

Ah I need to say this is all i remember so I think I either stop reading after or this is a middle of some arc (hope not or it's impossible to find),

I believe this was righ at the start, like it starts out with him spawning in the middle of a street and being attacked by some gang with some dark power, and he goes on attacking them wiping them out, and finding the leader, he starts using the mask, AH there were scrolls I think he got a scroll for fireball or something so there was magic of some sort, this picture of ""Kill the Hero"" really is how my imagination saw it or how I saved it.",False,manga,1706375935.0,1acfs7u,

   * I absolutely can not relate to these types of charcters. They are like babies, in a sense everything is handed to them or everything goes their way. I can not connect to a character that has no struggles or conflicts.

* The girls/female characters are shallow and fall for MC for the most shallow reasons
   * MC befriends one of the FMC and then the FMC say ""I don't know why, but my heart is throbbing uncontrollably""
* To much comic relief (not sure if it is the right word)
   * Think of an MC that's in a dangerous situation with a dragon, then he tosses a stick which causes the dragon to chase it and say woof. After that, they become BFFs.

And there was this scene where she and the Love interests had to save the MC from this wizard guy who kidnapped here and made them go through these weird puzzles and the prince relived the scene where he broke up with her. There was also a scene where the villainess was supposed to push her off a cliff but instead she saved her and ended falling instead. Does anyone know the title?

Sports manga - substitutions,"Potentially niche topic, but I was curious if there were substitutions in sports manga/anime that people distinctly recall being hype/cool. Imo in intense games in sports manga the subs are always a really fun aspect, usually they shift the entire flow of the game and it's always cool seeing the tactical decisions and their resulting explanations, as well as letting more of the roster play. Some I think of are:

Blue Lock (Chapter 128) >!Reo and Hiori subbed on in the U-20 match. Really fun seeing how they subbed to adapt to the current game state, and it was really nice seeing how the game state shifted.!<

Kuroko no Basket (Chapter 186) >!Subbing on Furihata was really unexpected given that he had never done like anything the entire series. Thought it was really cool how he wasn't suddenly buffed but him being less good than the rest was actually the point by slowing down the flow of the game to let the team get their heads back on straight!<

Ao Ashi (Chapter 254) >!Asari and Shimura coming on was cool as always to see what tactic Fukuda had pulled out!<",False,manga,1706330157.0,1ac2i55,

[HELP Finding Title] Manhua or webnovel about drragon council/direct lineage humans that can turn into dragons.,The most I can remeber is that there were a council of dragons and any humans who had direct lineage to them were able to turn into dragons. This one family had a dad who was I think the right hand to the Leader of Dragons council and went to meet with him. One of the dragons on the council was evil and used some sort of elder tree magic or something to kill the other dragons and create dragon killing mosnters or smth. The family had two kids and the ran away. They ended up on some base where there were these monster with red crystals or eyes that would kills humans i think. I remeber two books/parts came out and the first one showed a girl in a coma and she suddenly wakes up. The second part went back in time to show how she went into a coma or vice versa.

"Looking for name of manga about a girl who goes through a lot of rooms to reach the human world, while a demonic creepy ass creature tries to stop her","HELLA SPOILERS 

I saw a video about this manga where the story was about a girl who was lowkey alien or something and she was living in a room with a number attached and she read about humans + the real world and wanted to go there but first had to go through a bunch (a few hundred maybe? i remember there being around 400) while some creepy looking creature accompanied her being like ""u sure u wanna go?"" and each room had a different theme.

And she flew past most of them no biggie but then one of the rooms was kinda emotional I think it was about a family where she almost got stuck but abandoned them anyways. Each time the girl went through a room she looked more gross-looking and at the final room she was covered in fungus and had like a tentacle arm and missing an eye.

Then when she passed the final room the disgusting stuff peeled off like a lizard shedding its skin and she looked normal like she was at the start? I think the manga started with a B and I don't think its NSFW because I saw the parts from all over the story on youtube and it was pretty popular (100k-1M views ish).

BTW lemme know if I did something wrong with submission because the rules were kinda confusing.",False,manga,1706327985.0,1ac1u49,Bibliomania

Got a Kindle paperwhite for some manga,"I tried out the free trial with kindle unlimited but not too sure if i'll hold on to it much longer, it seems to focus more on actual novels than manga which i wasn't too aware of.   


Now i found a great couple of mangas, Flowers of Evil and i especially enjoyed Happiness and didn't mind paying for the last couple digital volumes whatsoever.   


He's got other work on there but for about 6 volumes its around $40 for a couple nights of reading.   


Does anyone have any experience with   Shuzo Oshimi and perhaps other authors who write in a similar style. I've not bought any physical mangas since the DB paperbacks but they take up so much room i've got them currently in storage! So i thought the kindle could be a great way to sample stuff out and perhaps buy once i know i'm enjoying it.   


Any suggestions would be amazing, especially while i've still got my Kindle unlimited subscription but eh there's nothing besides Oshimi's work that really appealed to me. I like the surreal and almost eldritch tones in the visuals on Happiness, it was genuinely a great read for me and i recommend it for anyone who's yet to :)   


It's my first post here so apologies if i've broken any rules enquiring about this. I just thought the best place to hit would be the Manga reddit after seeing another fellow a year back got some assistance.

So, this was back in 2014-2015 somewhere around there. I read a manga online and I absolutely loved it, but I can't remember the name of the title or author/artist; and I'd really like to go back and reread it! So, it's got a similar plot to High Rise Invasion and Tower of god. Basically, the main character is kidnapped and wakes up in a room. There's an earpiece in his ear and he is told if he doesn't cooperate with the game, he will die. He is also told that if he tries to escape or rip out the earpiece, it will explode. The game has a live audience that the MC can hear through the earpiece and the audience even makes bets and don’t realize that the “game” isn’t just a reality tv show. The object of the game is to reach the top of the highest floor in the building and be the last one standing/ survivor. I don't remember much but he goes through a battle of morals because some of the people he encounters are normal people just like him and he doesn't want to cause harm to them. While other people are just out to kill anyone that they encounter. I don’t remember much about the other characters he meets besides this one girl who shared her story of being bullied in school to a point where she tried to h@ng herself in the girls bathroom but failed and instead ended up in the game.

Need Help to find a manga!! Plz!!,"So, few years ago, maybe around 2015 I read a manga with three main characters 2 boys and 1 girl. I think there was a love triangle as well (at the beginning at-least. But by end all 3 mc's are friends). They all go to school or college but manga is mainly focused on their personal lives. 

So the first boy tranfers to the school/college of other 2 mc's, belongs to not so rich family, can't afford to dye his hairs so bleaches it instead. (Probably: He only lives with his mother I.e. single parent household). 

The second boy belongs to a rich family, wears cool outfits and drives a cool bike, while wearing high-heels(yeah the female one) but he's straight. 
His father is businessman or businessman+m@fia. He also carries armaments and there's few scenes of delinquency in manga.
(Probably: There's a scene where he picks up the female mc from street and takes her on his bike for a ride.)

Can't remember much about the girl, but she is conflicted between the two at the start. And probably in the last panel 
she's crying or says some sad quotes.

There's one more thing, the manga could be Korean or from Korea-influenced author, can't remember it being a web-toon or manhwa though.

Need help finding a manga.,"Sorry if these type of posts are annoying but I've been looking for an old manga I enjoyed a couple years ago. 
So basically it's about a guy who died and revived in the past. He's in a future civilization ruled by noble houses but there's one super Ai that even the King has to work with. When he revives he uploads an advanced mech blueprint to the super ai and is given a king rank within the goverment. It's then also revealed that there's a martial realm he can transfer to In. Order to get stronger. There's his realm. A Demon realm invading his realm and then the martial realm which is also fighting the demon realm. So he works hard in both the martial realm and his realm to try and avoid the Demon apocalypse in his world from the future. 
When I stopped reading it. The apocalypse in his own realm just started and he was pretty strong in his realm but still kinda weak in the martial realm. 
I also remember he became the diciple of a female cultivator in the martial realm. One of the 3 saints I think.

I remember that at one point there’s a story about a baseball bat. At the moment of the baseball bat, there’s a motorcycle and an elderly lady. The bat is used by a human (I think he dies at that moment).

I also remember that at the beginning of the story, the heroine who has just been reincarnated took possession of the body of a woman who is very frowned upon in her tribe but as she integrates into it, a love triangle forms between her, the man the former owner of the body is trying to flirt with and another man.

"What is required reading to understand what ""Shonen"" is?","Hello,

A lot of times when I see people discuss the weirder or unique tropes in anime/manga/manhwa/manhua, I see the word ""shonen"" thrown around often, like ""oh this is typical of a shonen anime"" or ""he is a shonen protagonist"". I tried looking up definitions online, but they come off as too dry or mechanical to really give me a solid feeling on what distinguishes a ""shonen"" from any other kind of story. There is a lot of fighting, sure, but lots of genres that aren't shonen have fighting too, so that definition doesn't really distinguish it very well.

So, I wonder what is the recommended corpus of anime/manga/manhwa that best conveys the distinguishing features of Shonen in its rawest form, so I can get a better grasp on what it means beyond the official definition.

Some sources have told me that Shonen traces its origins back to the 16th century Chinese novel *Journey to the West*, which I find very surprising. I've heard of *Journey to the West*, but I've never associated it with the distinguishing tropes of Asian media nowadays. It always came off to me as a typical classic myth, one that fits right at home with Western literature like *The Golden Fleece* or *The Labors of Hercules* or *The Quest for the Grail*, none of which are typically considered Shonen.

**EDIT:** I hope it isn't too late to clarify that I mean Battle Shonen, which is a genre. I don't mean the demographic. ",False,manga,1707328190.0,1al8x2l,

RAISE WA TANIN GA

This is so good. It is about Yaguza. It's a rom com but also a little psychotic. There is **not much nudity** which is good I think it is the perfect amount of nudity. 

Sesame Salt and Pudding

 OMG. I don't know how cute can this manga gets. There is **NO** nudity at all but it's a rom com about a 22 years old girl who accidentally got married with an unemployed 42 years old man.

I'm searching for a short manga I read on the internet a few years ago. I loved the atmosphere and would love to dive into it again. Here's what I can remember:

It's set in a dystopian future where all of humanity has become androids, suffering from this condition. They are obsessed with becoming human again.

The story follows a human boy, probably the last of his kind, on his quest for survival in an android city where everyone is hunting him to acquire parts or all of his body.

There's an android that help to defends and hide him. This android looks like a detective or something and is the secondary character of the story.

As the story progresses, the chase becomes more intense, and the boy is convinced he needs to turn into an android as well to defend himself. Meanwhile, his android protector tries to convince him not to do it.

In the end, >!the boy surrenders himself to the android boss of the city, wanting to gain power. The android boss sees an opportunity to become human again, so they attempt a transfer. The manga ends on a cliffhanger, but it's somewhat implied that the android boss died and the boy is now the new android boss.!<

Is the Pokémon manga worth starting ?,"Hello,   


I read mangas a decade ago. I sort of stopped when I moved away from my parents and I'd like to rekindle with them.   


I know that Pokémon has a manga that is something in Japan, I've seen some pages online left and right.   


Is there anything I should start with ?   


Suggestions of... generations to read ?   


I've been told it was a bit darker than the anime, not being super gore or strange but like... less kid-friendly at times.   


Best regards,

The reason for her execution is for crime that I think she didn't commit, IIRC there are multiple bad actors that wants to put the blame on the heroine.

another details I remembered:

# The heroine is human, not an elf. The Dragon definitely doesn't have a human form yet, I think it's because he is a young dragon at the start of the story.

This part, I don't think I remember them correctly:

I think one of the accusations against the heroine is that she is a witch because no ordinary human would get close to dragon like she does.

1. MC isnt the strongest. in this, he's definitely OP. but so are other characters.
2. Other characters still grow and develop.
3. The characters are developing the world around them (building communities, clans, etc)
4. MC is not ""chosen"" or special. they had the same opportunity as everyone else, and either worked hard or got lucky.

OP MCs seem to be the most popular for a lot of stuff right now, but its always been boring to me. ive found a few good ones where they develop the characters well, but very few actually take the time to do it. any suggestions that might be enjoyable?

others ive read and really enjoyed.

The image, roughly translated, says this:

>This is FANZA doujin support, thank you for your continued support

>Thank you very much for registering your work.

>We apologize to the circle, but

>In accordance with the copyright owner's wishes,

>We are refraining from handling works that parody the following elements.

>■Parody element: Frieren at the Funeral

>We would like to inform you that due to the reasons above, the publication status of the work in question has been suspended

>Thank you for your continued support of FANZA Doujin.


Truth be told, I don't know if this is newsworthy enough for the subreddit, it's just something you don't see too often nowadays, at least for bigger series. I don't know if it’s limited to R18 doujinshi, but considering FANZA is the only place we know of that's been hit with this, it could be. And I don't know if the copyright holder, Shogakukan, is the one pushing for this, or the author.

I'm uncertain if other distributors are affected",False,manga,1707243837.0,1akgldt,NEWS

Looking for a specific manga (details in body),"So these are the main points to find it:

1. The main character has ancient tech hidden in his body (arms) that shows up at times and he had to learn to train to use them
2. This tech has a core that it runs from/like a battery and if destroyed, it deactivates
3. There's a fighting competition where they fight, and at some point they are on a floating island that starts breaking and falling out of the sky
4. There's a female character with tentacle/octopus powers and she is quite strong
5. There is a character who can fly using tech in his shoes, I believe and he uses explosives as well
6. There is a character who has a power where a dragon type creature hides underground and that's where the core is. He is apparently a murderer or the son of a murderer.

Red hair fox girl manga/manhwa??? help?,"I just wanted to say thanks again to the person who helped me on my previous post :)). But anyway, this one I also need help with as I forgor and is similar to my previous post that ive been looking for this for quite awhile now xd. The front cover was a cliche big booba woman but she is a fox girl and has red hair?? I thought at first it was a slice of life but no it was modern day fantasy superpowers kinda genre/gimmick. The MC was a dude who was a completely normal guy until he met this woman in distress and decided to take action by literally slamming a dude's head with a fire extinguisher (I am just explaining this in memory of the chapters I can still remember and this is just coming out of my ass so im sorry if im wrong).  


They regrouped at his house, the woman decided to live rentfree with him (damn) although he was kind of opposed to it. Cant remember the rest but I remember him dying and turning into another version of himself that has super powers similar to Black Flash in JJK it having black and red colors but evil, until such time the fox woman convinced the evil version of himself to come back to his original body that was stuck in the bathtub..? iirc, when he revived he had new super powers that were more blue than red and was now considered an orphan since the public records counted him as deceased.  


One other character I remember on that manga/manhwa was an astolfo kinda guy (a trap), he wore a wig on one mission to lure out their prey with the mc and their super powers were purple claw energy.",False,manga,1707233420.0,1akcg3h,

Berserk is my favourite series now.,"So my taste is basic but my favourite series (both anime and manga) for well over 8-9 years was Naruto.

I’ve read all the chapters, bought a lot of merch, etc.

The last 2-3 years I’ve been playing the Dark Souls series of games which takes heavy (almost blatant rip-off territory) inspiration from Berserk.

After I bought and sunk 700 hours into Elden Ring, I decided to pick up Berserk fully as I wanted to see why Miyazaki was so inspired and by god I’m so sorry I didn’t get into it sooner.

This series cleared Naruto for me. Absolutely cleared. I’ve always said the reason I liked Naruto so much was how much the characters and their stories meant and related to me, and good lord all it took was the first chapter of Deluxe Edition 1 and I was immediately blown away.

The world building the character development the ART STYLE everything is perfect. 

Guts as a character is something I could make a whole post about on its own, cuz there isn’t a way I could come close to doing his writing Justice.

When he came back to give the news to his party, he found the fmc and another dude in a party in a room or bed something.

I am looking for a manga that I read and forgot,"The setting starts where half the world is initially unknown to humans. It lies behind a fog or wall of sorts in which any being that goes across never comes back. The story begins with an expedition ship that was sent there coming back successfully, this is the first to ever return  (I think). When the expedition ship returns there are foreign lifeforms brought back that have never been seen before. These lifeforms appear as hyper-evolved versions of normal creatures (i.e. monstrous mosquitos). They break out and begin a massacre and the MC stops it. It is later revealed that there was a hidden faction of people who knew the violent lifeforms on the other side of the globe. This faction works to protect humans from the terrifying lifeforms that are trying to wipe them out.

The reason for this thread's existence is the fact that both requests and suggestions became kind of stale. It's supposed to bring out more manga that is not RTed or recommended. Also, it's quite useful for the discussion of not so current titles.

Also, not a rule or any kind of criticism, the more interesting part is not the list of the stuff you read, but your impressions of it.

The horizon,"This is one manga I think everyone needs to read, no matter what sort of person you are or demographic you’re from. I read it a few years ago but for some reason rereading it has changed me more than I thought it would. I think because of the state of the world right now, I can understand the message behind the manga a lot more better now. 

So it revolves around two children, a boy and a girl in amidst a war. The boys mother is shot and killed so he starts walking. All he does is walk. Until he reaches a bus to rest. When he wakes up, he finds a girl hiding in the bus with him. They stare at each other for a while until they hear gunshots. That’s when he grabs her hand and they run until they reach a road. They start walking again until they meet a man. He’s a bit weird, at least to the boy. The girl seems to like him though. The man starts following them so the boy comes up with an escape plan which fails. They try again but by then the girls already formed a small bond with the man so she doesn’t want to leave him alone. Unfortunately, it’s not the best decision because the man tries to rape the girl. The boy stabs him and they run until they’re kidnapped. They got shot at by a man in a suit who rescues them but you soon find out he’s not a nice man. Or maybe he is, it’s really all down to your own interpretation. They start walking again and then you get a flashback to the girls background. She was the sole survivor of a group travelling on the bus she was introduced in. They all passed away from a contagious disease except one, a man who was shot at. The thing about this manga is that it focuses on the innocent. All those lives just forgotten. They lived on this earth, they were once alive and would have lived. Innocent people don’t start War’s so why do they pay that price? I cried so many times reading this shit. The boy and the girl keep walking until they reach the end of the road. That’s when they find another pair of children. The boys both raise their guns to each other and it’s this scene this is so impactful in my opinion. Like y’all don’t understand. They’re children raising guns at each other. I think I kind of just waffled a lot but I’m not going to ruin the end. I can’t do that.

okay so i don't remember much about it cause i read it a while back but it was so good. 
there were 2 main characters the mc and ml i forgot the name of the mc but the ml's name was mai. so the main character likes watching this streamer calls mai and he streams normal stuff like gaming talking etc but he later has a 18+ stream after hours, then the mc wins this giveaway to meet mai in person and go on a ""date"" with him then they hang out blah blah blah then later they go to a motel and try to ___ but then mai's wig falls off (he had a blonde wig and his real hair was black) then the mc looks at him a bit longer and says he looks like this kid from middle school that he was really close with but mai just laughs it off. after that they start to hang out more and that's then the mc opens up to mai telling him that in middle school he knew this boy but the boy went missing and that they semi had something. then later on in the book i forgot how but mai tells the mc that's him that he's the guy from middle school (he said his real name but i forgot it) then he said he ran away cause his dad would force him to do very bad things with grown woman cause he was an alpha. but when all this happened they were in the mc's house and when they all finished mai put a paralyzing drug on him or a sleeping drug idk and mai was walking away saying sorry but he has to go then the mc bites his hand to stay awake and like tackles mai to stop him from leaving. then the mc confessed his love and said to mai to never run away again, then they live happily ever after.

[spoilers] Saikano thoughts + Overarching themes?,"Hi y'all, I just finished reading Saikano and i'm trying to get my thoughts together.

It's a love story in the midst of a war, that much is clear -- so it's juxtaposing the lovey-dovey of a teenage romance and the grittiness of a huge tragedy. 

But I'm trying to think about all the little themes, threads, and storylines here.

**Being a Weapon**: Chise is a weapon, and struggles with her sense of ""duty"" to her country and the individualism that comes with teenagehood. She wants a boyfriend, a childhood, a teenage romance, things that are very personal -- but the duty to her country, and how everyone relies on her to save their lives will sometimes outweigh that.

And yet, in the manga there's one part where she chooses instead to go on a date with Shuji (the night he cheats on her) and the soldiers are mortified that she'll leave the Kanto region without any aid and let the Japanese soldiers die. She tells them it doesn't matter, that the Japanese people are just people who were born in the same country as her, and that whether the enemy dies or the Japanese soldiers die, they're all strangers to her.

So we have a bit of a theme about the pointlessness of war as well.

**Infidelity**: Akemi likes Shuji, someone who is clearly not available as he's dating Chise. But when she learns they've ""broken up"", she immediately goes to confess to Shuji, both directly and indirect (""why don't you ask me out?"", even if its played off as a joke). 

Then there's the whole Fuyumi arc, where Shuji can't forget ""his first"" and cheats on Chise. Both Chise and Tetsu (Fuyumi's husband) are off at war, away from their spouses. It seems to me that the manga implies that cheating is inevitable when your spouses are away at war, considering it happens to both Chise and Tetsu? What do you all think? (I disagree with this but my argument is that it's what *the manga* is trying to say)

**Complacency**: Shuji, and everyone in the small Hokkaido town, really -- all take up so many pointless things in the middle of a war. The boys are always talking about tits or ass and the girls are giggling all the time, talking about shonen jump comics, etc -- meanwhile Japan, even Sapporo, are being absolutely leveled. They really take for granted their safety and don't realize that their safety isn't guaranteed. It isn't until the major earthquake that any of them feel at the mercy of anything at all.

Love: ? I'm a bit unsure at what this comic is trying to say about love. ",False,manga,1707063617.0,1airl9h,

Trying to find an isekai manga.,"Sorry, all I can remember about it was that MC got into a prestigious academy, passing some written exams with flying colors and gets confronted by a noble girl who came in second place, MC doesn't want there to be any competition between them and openly states that he has no motivation and doesn't really care which angers her further. The school has a big meet up and he has to give a speech and pledges alongside the girl who got second place (He whispers her lines to her since she got stage fright and forgot them. She thanks him later). 

They get assigned dorm rooms and meets his cousin who decides to act like a prick (The Cousin's Father approves of MC, the Cousin does not for some reason). MC doesn't take crap from anybody and actually decides to fight back, literally strangling his cousin until he concedes, getting the attention of the people next to his dorm and the dorm mother. She scolds him for his actions and he claps back, stating how if his dorm mate wasn't such a muscle-headed prick he wouldn't have to beat the shit out of him, and how he's getting scolded even though it was self-defense. He gets suspended to his homeland for a couple weeks, but not before saying goodbye to one of his friends who assured MC that he won't get expelled for something like this.",False,manga,1707031243.0,1aii7au,

Please help me find this BL manga/manhwa,"The smutty BL manga/manhwa was in black and white and iirc added a chapter once a month. It had very few chapters at the time I read it sometime 2-3 yrs ago.

The main character was a college-age(?) guy, I'll call A, with some hair color other than black, who has a crush on his handsome black-haired, athletic (basketball player?) friend B. I think they were friends since high school, where the dark-haired friend was popular. I think he had thoughts like ""I'm surprised he talks to me when he's so popular with everyone especially the girls"" and stuff. In one of the chapters I think they played some sport together and went to the shower room after, where A took a peek at B's body. Once B got out, A got off to the thought of B's jacked body, and afterward, B was like ""What took you so long? You weren't jerking were you?"" I think at one point during that exchange B was flirting and there were signs he also liked A.

Ofc, it being smutty, there were parts with A getting off in the bath in his apartment. I can't remember if he lived with a roommate or whatever but I think another guy did engage sexually with him.",False,manga,1707023978.0,1aig93r,

All I can remember is that the main character has white eyes (pretty positive he’s blind) and white hair I think. Because he’s blind it made him a great fighter. His backstory is also fucking tragic if I remember correctly. I also faintly remember a scene in the manga where he was trying to save his childhood friend (?) from a villain who led him into a trap (I think). 

The artwork in the manga is also very detailed and interesting which makes me want to find the manga even more.

Looking for a specific BL manga - please help!!,"This is the first time I'm posting on reddit, so I hope I chose the correct community. If not, I'm sorry in advance 🙈 

So, I've been searching for a specific manga I read years ago. I can't find it no matter what I enter in Google.
I only remember the beginning and that I liked it a lot 🥲

The setup was somewhat like this:
Our MC comes home from work or something and gets accosted in front of his building by his (I think) ex-boyfriend. The dude harasses him quite a lot and I think he was abusive in their relationship. Then the MC's neighbor turns up and the MC gets him to pretend to be his new boyfriend. (I'm not too sure about this, could be that the neighbor pretends without being asked.) They make out (I think) and the neighbor scares the ex away. The neighbor is actually straight but can't help falling for the MC. 
That's about all I recall.

2. I was under the impression the Komori persona was part of Mari all along and absorbed into her as one.

I'm looking for recommendations where a smart and savvy girl who transform into a gyaru, while maintaining, or at least keeping at a respetable level, her intelligence throughout the storyline.

This character then embraces the gyaru lifestyle without compromising her intelligence, retaining her role as the class rep or continuing to showcase her intellectual prowess. 

Or other scenario where a Gal shows her intelligence in the same sense.

I’m looking for a manga I read a few years ago but I can’t remember the name at all, so I was hoping someone here knows it; I’ll share the details I remember about it:

It focuses on the story of a psychopath boy; the art style is incredibly unique; it didn’t have many chapters (perhaps around 15??) ; the boy in the story riled up a “gang” of sorts in his school composed of other, younger boys; he had a “cult” and performed many homosexual acts; there was a panel maybe? about consuming feces (??) ; 

as you can see, not the best things to put into google to look for it, so again, if anyone knows it please let me know
thank you!

Leon saß in seinem Auto und fuhr nach Hause von der Arbeit. Er war müde und gestresst. Er hatte einen langen Tag gehabt und er freute sich darauf, nach Hause zu gehen und sich auszuruhen.

Plötzlich sah er ein Licht auf der Straße vor sich. Er versuchte zu bremsen, aber es war zu spät. Das Auto prallte gegen das Licht und Leon wurde bewusstlos.

Leon wusste nicht, wie er in diese Welt gekommen war, aber er war entschlossen, herauszufinden, was los war. Er beschloss, sich auf eine Reise zu begeben, um mehr über diese neue Welt zu erfahren.

**Kapitel 3: Die Prüfung**

Leon reiste durch die neue Welt und traf viele verschiedene Menschen. Er lernte viel über die Geschichte und Kultur dieser Welt.

Eines Tages traf Leon auf einen alten Mann, der ihm erzählte, dass er ein Held sein sollte. Der alte Mann sagte Leon, dass er gegen den grausamen Dämonenkönig kämpfen musste, um die Welt zu retten.

Leon war erschrocken, aber er wusste, dass er die Aufgabe übernehmen musste. Er begann, sich auf den Kampf gegen den Dämonenkönig vorzubereiten.

Eines Tages tauchte eine neue Bedrohung auf. Ein mächtiger Zauberer hatte sich erhoben und drohte, die Welt zu erobern.

So, I was watching a Youtube Manga Recap of the scene where a boy was hiring members (I forgot if he was a noble boy or not). He then posted a request saying he is looking for members. And I remember that the members still get paid despite not taking a quest and everyone was surprised with it. That's when a female swordsman or a female knight (her appearance she has a ponytail and wears a light armor, but I'm not 100% accurate) was interested. And when the boy was preparing his guild, the female knight appeared in front of the boy with the dragon she had just slayed and she told the boy that she's interested in joining him.  
And that's the scene that I remember as I was about to continue, the video got deleted.

PLEASE HELP ME FIND THIS MANGA," 

Hello, Im looking for a romance/supernatural manga that I believe was either written in the 90s or 2000s, classic black and white artstyle also beautifully illustrated.

What I remember about the plot:

* The protagonist was a young beautiful girl around the age of 13 who used to be a model
* She had a proud character
* She moved to a seaside town with her family
* People at her new school where envious of her at the beginning but latter accepted her
* She met a boy who was her classmate who had magical powers connected with the sea, very big part of his character
* They became kind of friends/rivals/eachothers crushes
* There was a **big plot point** about a photographer who she used to work with wanting to do a nude/semi nude photoshoot with her. She agrees but her parents refuse, so she secretly goes to Tokyo for the shoot and the boy accompanies her.

Some other things I remember but I'm not actually sure if they're true:

* The title might contain some of these words: blue, spark/sparkling, clear, ocean, sky
* There is a scene where he either drags her or they full in water together
* I think it's completed but it's not really long, around 70 chapters",False,manga,1706923426.0,1ahk25b,

Main character leaves after the sister funeral and opens a restaurant in the city as a commoner, and the stage sets in which the heroine of the otome, a girl from the countryside who looks exactly like the villainess's younger sister, is introduced.

20th century boys ending,"WARNING FOR SPOILERS

Hi, just finished 20th century boys and it became my favourite manga. I know there are ready tons of posts about this but I wanted to know other opinions on the ending.
SPOILERS ABOVE



I read it in the perfect editions but I don't really
know what to think about the ending. Which makes more sense more and is overall ""better"". Even though the original ending,  makes sense and it's much more simple, when the first friend dies in 2015 in the science lab, katsumata, the second friend becomes ""the new friend"". The second ending, the one that came into the perfect editions, Is a bit more complex, I think.

I am looking for ... ?,"I am looking for a Manga or manwha, I am not sure what it is. Its been so long since I have read it, and I can barely recall much from it, so I apologize if what I mention below is not accurate. 

&#x200B;

It starts off by introducing the main character, hes supposedly supposed to be some average not rich worker, who is searching for girls on some "" online forum "". He reaches out to a girl and she doesnt reply till later. I believe he is sending out applications for females if they would like to have a master / submission relationship with him. He is reluctant that this girl messages back as she is pretty and young. They message back and forth and she is also very much into the whole scenario. There is a scene where they are texting and he mentions to her .. I believe .. that she can touch herself but she cant use her toys or pentration?.. or something...? She teases herself repeatedly and even uses the corner of a table? to edge her self before relieving herself. I cant remember too much about this but I laso recall a scene where he buys her a gift.. I think lingerie? and also they end up meeting at a coffee shop to official meet in person as it has always been through their phones. She gets turned on by the things they discuss.. I believe rules for the relationship? and she soaks the chair with her .. anyways. they leave the area and sit on a bench? and I believe he does things to her . . This is the extent of my knowledge on this.

I was browsing in facebook and suddenly remember the manga i read years ago, I think I was 10-12 years old when I read that manga, i'm not really sure since that was long time ago.

So about this manga I will only tell the scenes that i remember, it's not clear tho so it's not accurate but i hope you can help me find it since i really want to reread it again.

There is a male lead, he has dark hair i think and wearing glasses, i think he is still a student and he has a brother (im not sure), he is just walking and then suddenly he passed by in a street where someone is fighting..... (fast forward, i don't remember the next) , he met a girl who is good with katanas, the girl was raised up in a dojo, and is still living there, i think the girl is also his classmate that don't go too often in school since she go out and fight most of the time ( again, im not sure sorry, lets fast forward the story ), he has superpowers ( i'm not sure if he knows, he hide it, or he don't know, i don't remember sorry 😭) his super powers is super strong, maybe its already obviously since he is the male lead, sorry i don't remember what power he has ( fast forward again ), he met people that has super powers , ( i think i remember now, he can imitate the powers of others, not sure again ),  so the people that i remember that he met is, 

1. The girl in wheel chair (not sure if she's really in wheel chair
2. Man with apple head
3. The cat in a suit/clothes
4. Immortal man ( i think he is wearing a military clothing)

That's all i can remember, there is more but i don't remember now

So the last chapter that i read that i remember tho im not sure again is when they formed an alliance with the people he met, then they have war, he fights , that's where i remember those character , the cat with clothes , the man that has immortality power, and the girl in a wheel chair

That's what i remember, sorry if my story is not clear, i'm not really sure of the story since i read more manga and i think my mind was messed up and im confused,  so im not really sure about it, but i hope you can help me, thank you ❤️",False,manga,1707660599.0,1ao8s3d,

Can't find this villainess manhwa again,"Edit: solved!

I read a story a while back that was in early chapters and I guess I never added it to my mal or bookmarks cuz I can't find it again

It's a villainess manhwa about a girl getting reincarnated into a tragedy she read, and the character she becomes is this little girl with purple hair who gets adopted into a powerful family where the potential heirs are encouraged to destroy each other to prove their worth. The protagonist was adopted to prove to the biological children that nothing is guaranteed, and if they don't quit acting entitled then an orphan off the street might take their birthright

I think she also gets some kind of power that makes her eyes turn red.

So, the protagonist is an alcoholic model with silver hair and a terrible character. He's despised by everyone and hated by his co-workers. He meets a brown hair guy who owns the hotel where he is taking pictures (almost drawn in the swimming pool due to the heat).
Those two are gonna expose the protagonist's boss who is obsessed with him, his muse (Actually, he took the protagonist as a model because his father, the real muse, didn't want to do it. But they look alike). The art tends to make an excessive set of teeth when the protagonist is upset (often).

Finding a manga,"Back in 2022 or ‘23, a manga was on my feed on tt. I remembered about it and decided to read it but I don’t remember what it was called. 
  The manga was about  three childhood friends (2 boys, one girl) together but the one boy went away. Fast forward, the boy in the group liked a new girl , but turns out the boy that went away was their friend. He transitioned to a girl. The manga was about the boy having a sexuality crisis since he liked a girl who was a guy. The trans girl proceeds to go for him and have these feelings type for him? I just know that there was a shower scene which was pretty weird. The girl liked the boy before he transitioned and asked him why he did it. In the end of the story the cis boy and trans girl like each other in the end. 

   That’s all I remember. But idk if this will help. Ik it’s some physiological thing since I heard it you give you a type of identity crisis. Anyways I hope you can help me. Please and thanks :)",True,manga,1707623414.0,1anysbj,

I cant remember much but the story was about a girl and a guy who go around helping people with their problem. The genre is horror/mystery.

The MC gave her an apple, and told her to bite and and it will make her pretty. But she must keep the apple even tho its gonna be rotten. Long story short, the girl becomes pretty and was about to kiss her crush. But then, her mom saw the apple that she been keep on her room, and destroyed the rotten apple. Because of that, when she about to kiss her crush, her face becomes ugly and melting.

Hajime No Ippo Creator Speaks Against Anime Studios Tweaking The Original Plot Of Manga,"On February 7, the author of popular manga Hajime No Ippo, George Morikawa, reaffirmed his unwavering support for the rights of people who created their original creative works via a Twitter post.

In the post, he expresses that it is important to preserve the author’s creative vision, and they will always believe that they will always have a final say in it.

He also highlights that the purpose of the laws is to protect the proprietary rights and authority of the original writers in their work.

Morikawa states that although readers, editors, and adaptators could shed light on previously published materials, only the original creator knows the future of the story.

For this reason, they should have complete control over their work.

He further states that the original artists might be given the freedom to exercise their legal rights to the unrestricted maintenance of their intellectual properties.

Morikawa, however, also indirectly targeted anime studios for changing or adding their interpretation to the manga creator’s work.

***“The reason is absolute because the original author is absolute. Just as before, this message is also for aspiring manga artists. Despite facing backlash, authors have continuously asserted their absolute authority. The rights of primary creators, including manga artists, novelists, and screenwriters, are protected by law. And what’s crucial is that only the original author knows the future. That’s why it’s absolute.***

***Everything that editors and adaptors, including readers, see, is already in the past. Only the original author knows what the future holds. This is even more true if the series is still ongoing and unfinished. Any alteration, intervention, or adaptation of the past will erode the present and affect the future. That is why it is important to discuss and give your opinion. What is needed is respect, gratitude, and courage, not an overbearing attitude. The future that the work and its readers look forward to should not be ruined or lost because of the bending of others who only know the past. Only the author can protect the work’s future.”***",False,manga,1707564190.0,1ane7su,

He also ends up getting a little demon girl on his team but demons are killed so they hide her horn with a ribbon. This is possible spoiler but he finds out if you kill the demon king the world is reset and he doesn’t want that to happen so he doesn’t kill the demon king.

Manga Collecting,"Wassup reddit, this is my first post ever and I wanted to ask y'all if you have some recommendations for me!  
I started watching anime a few years ago but I only started reading manga on 2023.  
I've watched a few anime (Berserk \[90's version\], Hellsing ultimate, AoT, Demon Slayer, Inuyashiki, Undead Unluck, Jjk, Mob Psycho 100, 91 days, Chainsaw MAn, Death Note, Deadman Wonderland, Banana Fish, Biao Ren and many others...) but because I've only started reading manga a couple of months ago my collection is still slim. I've got all of Death Note Black editions, Monster 1st vol. , 3 Tokyo Ghoul Vol., 3 jjk Vol, One Punch Man also 3 Vol. , Gannibal 1st vol., Uzumaki, Chainsaw man 12 vol., and a couple of more mangas that were translated to portuguese (samurai and shinobi stories like 'O preço da desonra' and 'Butterfly Beast'). I've tried to get my hands on Dorohedoro and Inuyashiki but it's hard. I've read all the mangas I have (except I'm only now finishing Monster vol.1).  
I've read Fire Punch online and I absolutely loved it. I also love Chainsaw Man.

Spoilers follow... 


Later on its revealed he was abused by his female teacher / mentor? years back. 

Muuuuch later in he moves home partly to escape her return (might be hazy on deets) into a house linked to the main girl's family. Later on a bunch of the students decide to start cooking for him and spying on his activities.

Looking for specific recs as a beginner,"Hey guys, 

I’m someone with a learning disability that has struggled reading all my life but am really wanting to try manga as I enjoyed comics as a kid. (I’m 25)

I’d like some recs based off some of the anime I watch - I am looking for some that do NOT have an anime and are completed (or 100% will be) 

I am someone typically really into fantasy from isekai to complete high fantasy, I also enjoy slice of life. The following variables are what they would need to have, (please remember these are my preferences and if you don’t agree with them kindly don’t comment. I’m looking for help not hate or elitism.) 

Yes I know I could look this up but I’d much rather communicate with real people not AI made websites 

The must haves:

-romance (very important) the anime the devil works as a part timer captured EVERYTHING for me. As well as how a realist hero rebuilt the kingdom (one of the funny and one of the less funny ones I enjoy on the anime side)

(I don’t want direct misogyny but I do find animes that make fun of some tropes to be funny) I.e Konasuba | Iruma kun

-humor (I greatly prefer humor and comedy but having it as a very loud theme is okay too) 

-Fairly light hearted, I want to smile more than feel depressed, I use anime and would like to use manga as an escape

-balanced (up to interpretation) 

-not a ton of death (especially in main characters) (though I am goth and enjoy the theme of mortality and can handle it)

The must NOT have:

-completely macho themed, I don’t want a predictable macho guy plot or “bro vibe” 
-cannot just be violence (I prefer it to be about 50% or less)
-I’m not into space, modern military, and most especially not post apocalypse 
-I also do not want ANYTHING to do with sports as a main theme please. It’s fine if it’s in it some for let’s say a highschool sports episode or something but it cannot be a theme. Modern is already pushing it enough but I loved the love is war anime so I’m trying to be flexible 

Preferences: (would be nice) 

-little gothic (but does not have to be) 
-silly goofy 
-some complexity to it (optional) 


Really wanting something to help hook me into Manga and motivate me to keep reading (one of the reasons I would like ones without an anime)

Finding Manga - MC wears a mask with buttons as his eyes.,"I am looking for a manga that I read during work. I don’t remember the title nor character name sorry but I do remember some panels and plots so please help me find it.

First chapter started with a boy saw a beautiful lady in her mainson/house. Then he got invited to her house. Saw she was naked on the sofa then his classmate, another boy with glasses, close the door behind him. As the door closed, the lady jumped and attacked the boy, ripped his heart out and let the 4 eyes kid pressed the juice out of it and poured it in her mouth. 

The boy now lured more victims for her and one of the classmates became her victim again, saw a bracelet on his hand, instead of kill the boy this time, she ripped the four eyes mouth and killed him. Cut the boy legs then chained him up. He now looked horrible, scars, his hair turned white and his skin falling off.

He realised he had became a monster like her. He went to met his lover accidentally killed her, ripped off her hand. He brought her to a police to bring her to hospital. He also learnt that in order to remain the beauty and look like normal, he had to kill human and drink heart. He did and also use it to save his girl. As the result, they’re both monster. 

As the story progresses, we learnt that the 4 eyes still alive and he became a monster. When he transform he looks like a joker on cards. Through him, we know that there are only 4 pure blood monsters and they are 4 sisters.",False,manga,1707435050.0,1am9ml4,

Looking for a manga with a good romance b plot.,"I know this is kinda weird but I whole heartedly believe I've read every good romance manga out there. I'm a huuuge fan of romance anything. Now I'm kinda looking for romance in different situations, more specifically something like shounen or battle manga but with actual good romance storylines. 

I'm currently reading solo levelling and I'm pretty far in, I was pretty interested in jin woos romance with hae in, however I don't see that going anywhere. At first I really liked that she was shown as someone more powerful and I loved that, I absolutely loathe the knight in shining armour trope. Except jin woo pretty much becomes everyone's knight in shinning armour by the end (ngl not really liking solo levelling but it's a fun guilty pleasure read). 

I basically want something like that but where the romance is more fleshed out (or atleast somewhat fleshed out, not expecting much because it will be the b plot). The only similar one I can remember is sword art online. Sao was kinda bad but I loved the parts of them just hanging out as a couple separate from the story, that's the kinda thing I would love to see. Like a good A plot but also breaks with these characters hanging out and falling in love. I can't think of anymore anime or manga like that tho. 

Also the woman being stronger than the man isnt a must, I just kinda hate it when the man comes in running to save the woman. Thanks in advance cos I know finding a shounen/battle manga with actual good romance plots will be tough (cough cough sakura sasuke).

Edit: accel world is one I just remembered and really enjoyed. Also a lot of sports anime fit the bill, cross game if I remember correctly had a great romance and I loved major too, but less so for the romance I just loved seeing them grow up together and end up together and especially with the sequel.",False,manga,1707432918.0,1am8tnm,

"How hard do you think it would be for a foreigner to get serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump, let alone at all?","I'm an aspiring teen just starting out high school, and my ultimate dream is to be able to get a manga serialized in WSJ one day. I know that as a foreigner (let alone me being a black foreigner), this will take a LOT of work and effort. I have many years ahead of me as I still haven't even reached my later teen years yet and I plan to dedicate this crucial time into pouring all the effort I can into my dream, but I just wanted to hear people's thoughts and opinions to make sure I'm not crazy or anything.  


1. As a foreigner, specifically an African American/Colored foreigner, how hard do you think it generally is to get your manga serialized in Japan, considering you are fluent in Japanese (JLPT level 1-2 fluency), have worked in the industry for some time, and have good-great art and storytelling?  

2. If there IS any xenophobia/colorism amongst manga serializers/publishers, do you think that by the time I'm an adult, let's say in 10-25 years, that this problem will get any better?  

3. What steps do you think that I should take at my stage to greater my chances? (I'm pretty good at art but I know that I can be way better, and I plan to work on that, and I'm also pretty good at writing and storytelling but I know I can get better at that too). Any recommendations?

&#x200B;

4. Other thoughts, ideas, opinions, and advice welcome!

&#x200B;

TLDR: As a determined aspiring teen with a dream to have a manga serialized in WSJ, I acknowledge the challenges as a foreigner and person of color.

Please and thank you!,"It’s a long shot but the most I can remember about it is that the young MC was a farmer(maybe commoner?) who would work with his father at a mansion. There, the MC meets a princess(? ) around his age and they start getting close. They grow up together and I can’t remember if there was magic involved or not but there was one chapter where I think the MC scolded the princess and his father got mad at him. Then later a prince comes in to try to court her but I think she doesn’t care but is forced by her father’s command and she runs to the MC. That’s about all I can remember.

Beet the Vandal Buster Volume 2 + English Volume 13-17?,"Big fan of this series, been trying to collect it for some time. Was wondering if there are any other Beet fans out there. 

The series went on hiatus in 2006 and was like that for 10 years due to the artist's failing health. They came back in 2016 and since then have released volumes 13-17. Doesn't seem VIZ is interested in picking up the series again for the west which breaks my heart. Maybe if enough of us draw attention to it they might change their mind.

This shit was so fucking hype at times and it was seriously one of the better sleeper shonen hits of the early 2000's. I can't express how much I loved it. 

I've tried collecting it and I'm getting close to having all the volumes but I've hit a snag. I have every English volume that was released but volume 2 is so elusive. No matter where I look I always find the other volumes but not #2 unless it's for a stupid price with high shipping rates. Any idea why this is? Did they just not print that many of that volume?

Also don't tell me to just fork over a ridiculous amount of money for this. I ain't paying more than $15 for a copy of an out of print manga.",False,manga,1707342390.0,1alemw8,

Need help finding a manga.,"Sorry if these type of posts are annoying but I've been looking for an old manga I enjoyed a couple years ago. 
So basically it's about a guy who died and revived in the past. He's in a future civilization ruled by noble houses but there's one super Ai that even the King has to work with. When he revives he uploads an advanced mech blueprint to the super ai and is given a king rank within the goverment. It's then also revealed that there's a martial realm he can transfer to In. Order to get stronger. There's his realm. A Demon realm invading his realm and then the martial realm which is also fighting the demon realm. So he works hard in both the martial realm and his realm to try and avoid the Demon apocalypse in his world from the future. 
When I stopped reading it. The apocalypse in his own realm just started and he was pretty strong in his realm but still kinda weak in the martial realm. 
I also remember he became the diciple of a female cultivator in the martial realm. One of the 3 saints I think. 
If anyone knows what I'm talking about I'd be grateful. Would love to re read it.

I'm searching for a short manga I read on the internet a few years ago. I loved the atmosphere and would love to dive into it again. Here's what I can remember:

It's set in a dystopian future where all of humanity has become androids, suffering from this condition. They are obsessed with becoming human again.

The story follows a human boy, probably the last of his kind, on his quest for survival in an android city where everyone is hunting him to acquire parts or all of his body.

There's an android that help to defends and hide him. This android looks like a detective or something and is the secondary character of the story.

As the story progresses, the chase becomes more intense, and the boy is convinced he needs to turn into an android as well to defend himself. Meanwhile, his android protector tries to convince him not to do it.

In the end, >!the boy surrenders himself to the android boss of the city, wanting to gain power. The android boss sees an opportunity to become human again, so they attempt a transfer. The manga ends on a cliffhanger, but it's somewhat implied that the android boss died and the boy is now the new android boss.!<

Is the Pokémon manga worth starting ?,"Hello,   


I read mangas a decade ago. I sort of stopped when I moved away from my parents and I'd like to rekindle with them.   


I know that Pokémon has a manga that is something in Japan, I've seen some pages online left and right.   


Is there anything I should start with ?   


Suggestions of... generations to read ?   


I've been told it was a bit darker than the anime, not being super gore or strange but like... less kid-friendly at times.

another details I remembered:

# The heroine is human, not an elf. The Dragon definitely doesn't have a human form yet, I think it's because he is a young dragon at the start of the story.

This part, I don't think I remember them correctly:

I think one of the accusations against the heroine is that she is a witch because no ordinary human would get close to dragon like she does.

"stuff similar to ""The Lone Necromancer""","I know this is pretty much a Solo Leveling clone. those arent the aspects im looking for more of though. although i dont necessarily want to avoid them, im more looking for the following aspects.

1. MC isnt the strongest. in this, he's definitely OP. but so are other characters.
2. Other characters still grow and develop.
3. The characters are developing the world around them (building communities, clans, etc)
4. MC is not ""chosen"" or special. they had the same opportunity as everyone else, and either worked hard or got lucky.

OP MCs seem to be the most popular for a lot of stuff right now, but its always been boring to me. ive found a few good ones where they develop the characters well, but very few actually take the time to do it. any suggestions that might be enjoyable?

others ive read and really enjoyed.

The image, roughly translated, says this:

>This is FANZA doujin support, thank you for your continued support

>Thank you very much for registering your work.

>We apologize to the circle, but

>In accordance with the copyright owner's wishes,

>We are refraining from handling works that parody the following elements.

>■Parody element: Frieren at the Funeral

>We would like to inform you that due to the reasons above, the publication status of the work in question has been suspended

>Thank you for your continued support of FANZA Doujin.


Truth be told, I don't know if this is newsworthy enough for the subreddit, it's just something you don't see too often nowadays, at least for bigger series. I don't know if it’s limited to R18 doujinshi, but considering FANZA is the only place we know of that's been hit with this, it could be. And I don't know if the copyright holder, Shogakukan, is the one pushing for this, or the author.

I'm uncertain if other distributors are affected",False,manga,1707243837.0,1akgldt,NEWS

Looking for a specific manga (details in body),"So these are the main points to find it:

1. The main character has ancient tech hidden in his body (arms) that shows up at times and he had to learn to train to use them
2. This tech has a core that it runs from/like a battery and if destroyed, it deactivates
3. There's a fighting competition where they fight, and at some point they are on a floating island that starts breaking and falling out of the sky
4. There's a female character with tentacle/octopus powers and she is quite strong
5. There is a character who can fly using tech in his shoes, I believe and he uses explosives as well
6. There is a character who has a power where a dragon type creature hides underground and that's where the core is. He is apparently a murderer or the son of a murderer.

Red hair fox girl manga/manhwa??? help?,"I just wanted to say thanks again to the person who helped me on my previous post :)). But anyway, this one I also need help with as I forgor and is similar to my previous post that ive been looking for this for quite awhile now xd. The front cover was a cliche big booba woman but she is a fox girl and has red hair?? I thought at first it was a slice of life but no it was modern day fantasy superpowers kinda genre/gimmick. The MC was a dude who was a completely normal guy until he met this woman in distress and decided to take action by literally slamming a dude's head with a fire extinguisher (I am just explaining this in memory of the chapters I can still remember and this is just coming out of my ass so im sorry if im wrong).  


They regrouped at his house, the woman decided to live rentfree with him (damn) although he was kind of opposed to it. Cant remember the rest but I remember him dying and turning into another version of himself that has super powers similar to Black Flash in JJK it having black and red colors but evil, until such time the fox woman convinced the evil version of himself to come back to his original body that was stuck in the bathtub..? iirc, when he revived he had new super powers that were more blue than red and was now considered an orphan since the public records counted him as deceased.  


One other character I remember on that manga/manhwa was an astolfo kinda guy (a trap), he wore a wig on one mission to lure out their prey with the mc and their super powers were purple claw energy.",False,manga,1707233420.0,1akcg3h,

[Harem] Is there a manga where the mc has a harem of girls older than him ?,"Hello everyone,

I know this title seems a bit weird, but lately I've been reading and watching some popular harem series ( megami no café terrace, the mikodono sisters are surpisingly easy to deal with, we never learn etc... ) and this question crossed my mind.

I know that the harem trope is pretty famous and has a wide variety of settings, but is there a serie where a male mc somehow gets a harem of ""older"" girls than him ?

What I have in mind are relationships like the one in we never learn between Yuiga and his teacher, or the ones in Oregairu between Hachiman and his sensei, or even with Yui's mother.

I don't even know if such a serie exists, but considering that there are many different kinds of plots out there, even really questionnable ones with degenerate series, that maybe a ""classical"" plot with a young boy seducing different senpais of his might exist ?

If anything comes to mind, I'd like to hear your recommendations, fanservice/ecchi is okay but I'm not interested in hentai.

Furthermore, even if it's not harem, feel free to share any romcom or romance manga with a man and his senpai, that could interest me aswell ! ",False,manga,1707951861.0,1ar0k3q,

So, what am I looking at is a Shonen/Seinen (I think) that's... Really, anything. It doesn't have to follow some scrict guidelines.

Story-wise I'm open pretty much to everything, but it MUST have that ""name your move"". If that makes any sense.

I don't want to tell what I already read because if you suggest something I've already read that scratch that itch I'd re-read it without any problem. Ofc don't suggest Naruto/Boruto/Fairy Tail/100 Year Quest :P

After faking his death, the boy goes to live with his grandfather who trains him to take revenge. His grandfather was very rich and one day the protagonist finds out that the reason his family was poor was because his grandfather found out about Her daughter's pregnancy threw her out on the street, then our protagonist kills her grandfather and inherits his entire fortune (the protagonist gained her trust and made sure it was in the will and then killed him) after that she plans an elaborate revenge against the 4 girls and the girls are harassed for having killed a family. Then in the future the boy returns to his city to take revenge.

If you want a deep story there isn’t here my friend, or at least for the first 3 volumes. The characters are relatable but sometimes they are just really annoying for no reason than other to be annoying, but I might have adapted to that humor by the 3rd volume because I was laughing so hard at this volume, that my mom was giving me looks.

Looking for a 4 panel manga strip that might've been recently posted here,"Edit: Solved, Art of Defense, linked by Xanirran

I'm not sure if I saw it here or somewhere else, but I feel like I might've seen it here-

It's a funny 4-koma of a random guy approaching a couple, demanding the man hand over the woman, with the man constantly screaming ""please leave her alone!"" while giving him a [censored](/s ""BJ"") in the second panel, and doing [censored](/s ""say gex"") with him in the third, with the final panel leaving the random guy drained and collapsed on the ground, while the man urges the woman that they should flee while they can, where the woman screams in shock, ""what was that?!""

Apologies if it's inappropriate, but as of late I wanted to use it as a meme response to people and I couldn't seem to find it while attempting to retrace my steps",True,manga,1707875455.0,1aqb4kg,

My Top 10 Overpowered MC Manhwas," 

**My Top 10 Overpowered MC Manhwas**

I’m by no means a writer so bear with me, but I can’t contain my love for this genre inside me anymore. 

I personally find it almost therapeutic coming into a manhwa from the start knowing that for the most part, the Main Character is going to be just fine and they’re just going to be pulling off crazier and crazier feats. Is that ‘good’ writing?  Who’s to say, but it suits my tastes just fine at the moment.

Whether they’re a returner with special magic from 4000 years ago, or solo-leveling ranker with the power of the gods, there is something great about witnessing the journey of a character who’s just *better.* They may not be incredible immediately, or maybe they are, but one thing this genre has guaranteed me is many moments when I audibly say “ GODDAMN THAT WAS SICK”.

Also, I read a bunch of them in a short span of time so if I’m misrepresenting anything in the post, feel free to let me know.

**THE LIST:**

**10 - Doom Breaker**

**Story Class:** Returner

>!This is a classic returner story where our hero meets his end as the last human standing vs the demons and then wakes up at the beginning of his journey, with the “assistance” of the Gods.!<

This one places particular emphasis on the MC being resourceful and efficient, both with his time and his available opportunities. Information has higher value than raw strength, at least at first, but as they say, knowledge is power.

**PROS**: It  has a pretty nice class fantasy setting with great art and a nice somewhat grounded feel to the world.

&#x200B;

**9 - Duke Pendragon: Master of the White Dragon**

**Story Class:** Returner with a twist

**Thoughts:** This returner story has a pretty interesting twist that makes it a bit different from other similar stories.

One word I would use to describe this is smooth. The whole story just flows from start to finish. You'll finish it in the blink of he whole story just flows from start to finish. You'll finish it in the blink of an eye. *smooth* . The whole story just flows from start to finish. You'll finish it in the blink of an eye. 

**PROS:** This might be a strange thing to say, but the MC of the manhwa is gorgeous and so are many of the supporting cast. That said, don’t get it twisted, there is a good dose of well-drawn action, surprisingly better action choreography than most, actually. The art in general is great; it brings to life a classic fantasy world excellently. I loved it.

**Caveats**: Some may rate this higher, but the ones higher just had more unique stuff going on / are longer so have had more time to show off more stuff. 

&#x200B;

**8 - Skeleton Soldier Couldn’t Protect the Dungeon**

**Story Class**: Returner with an amazing twist

**Caveats**: Yes, we’re starting with caveats first. To read this you have to be okay with the MC getting a ton of ridiculous power ups very often at a point. Deal with it, or not, but it’s worth it.

The art …changes, and not for the better, in my opinion, along the way. It has such a unique style at the beginning which I’m still mourning. Oh, also it’s another game-UI manhwa.

It’s also not *super* bombastic compared to others in the genre.

**Thoughts:** >!Okay, this is basically Groundhog Day/Re-Zero on steroids.!<

>!The MC dies and gets revived in a spot, and whenever they die, they get stronger and revive in the \* same spot \*. Sounds simple enough, yeah? Well, due to the character’s they meet, and goals they set, the different lives the MC lives go in very different directions.!< It’s good stuff but won’t be for everyone. 

**PROS:** Really cool art for a while. Story really pushes its premise to the limits, and I mean that.

&#x200B;

**7 - Return of the Disaster-Class Hero**

**Story Class:** Returner..kinda?

**Thoughts:** This one is just pure, unbridled, *FUN.* The MC is one strong dude and he knows it and he isn’t afraid to show it. I will say no more. READ IT, IT’S **GODLIKE**.

**PROS:** Fantastic art, fun characters, high power level.

**Caveats:** It’s short. I cri evertim

&#x200B;

**6 - Level Up With The Gods**

**Story Class:** Returner / Ranker (I promise these are not all returners)

**Thoughts:** The cover art really doesn’t do this one justice. I almost didn’t read it because of that. It’s dope!

>!As with a lot of ranker stories, there’s a tower. Well, our hero, as well as many other mythological legends such as Hercules and Sun Wukong, reached the summit. Only to realize there were “others” and those others were impossibly strong. Our hero was sent back in time as the sole hope for all those calling the tower their home. !<

**PROS:** The MCs reputation really precedes him, and he lives up to it. The characterization of the mythological characters is great and not cheesy at all. Very nice art.

**Caveats**: The beginning is not terribly exciting, but luckily also not terribly long.

&#x200B;

**5 - The Legend of the Northern Blade**

**Thoughts**: Hear me out. This starts a bit different from how you would think it would, in the best way. The story takes its time to show the tragic beginnings of the MC and also shows how he lives his life for a decent bit before his “glow up”. 

The way the story and certain characters evolve is fun to see as well. Highly recommend it if you like Murim (Chinese Martial Arts World) manhwa, or haven’t tried ‘em.

**PROS:** Unique art style, lots and lots of cool characters and action shots, good scale up, vicious combat.

**Caveats:** The fight choreography could have been better / story kinda wanes later imo.

&#x200B;

**4 - Nano Machine**

**Story Class** \- OP MOFO

**Thoughts:** What happens when you cross Murim Manhwa with NANO-MACHINES (son) ?

No shit, you get ‘Nano Machine’. 

>!The weak, no-martial-arts MC is almost killed and gets saved by getting nano-machines implanted in his body.!< How? Who cares, you will quickly forget as you keep reading because frankly the plot is just that damn interesting. That’s the highest praise I can give this: it’s just interesting to read. 

You’ll enjoy reading about his journey to gain strength, the challenges he faces, the comrades he gains along the way, the rivals he defeats, and the threats hidden in the shadows looming over. It’s good stuff.

**PROS:** Good art, good story pacing, interesting world, interesting character moments, more vicious than you might imagine.

**Caveats:** The way he gets stronger is sometimes…egregious, but it’s fine.

&#x200B;

**3 - Elceed**

**Story Class:** Super Humans

**Thoughts:** Okay Elceed kind of shocked me, because it’s very different from what the cover art paints it to be. 

It’s a modern and vibrant story that follows an honestly darling super-powered MC, while showing how his life changes after certain events lead him to be exposed to the world of the Awakened. 

**PROS:** Great main characters, Good side characters, great art, nice pacing. Super Speed.  It’s just damn good and also really, really CUTE sometimes. Cats. Lots of Cats.

**Caveats:** Nothing worth writing about tbh.

&#x200B;

**2 - The Beginning After The End**

**Story Class:** Re-Incarnator/ Isekai

**Thoughts:** My personal GOAT. If Solo Levelling is what introduced me to the genre years prior, TBATE is what sucked me back in for good.

>!The story starts with the MC from “childhood” after he dies as a king in another world and wakes as a baby in another fantasy world with more magic than his own. It then follows his life from a child prodigy to his journey growing up and navigating the world, as well as the tumultuous happenings that shape him along the way.!<

Honestly, it’s better than I can describe it. Just read it.

For anime watchers it’s kinda like Mushoku Tensei but less grounded, less character focused, and less creepy. Also with the MC using their powers way better.

**PROS:** Badass MC, So many sick moments,  Cool characters, Generic world, which is actually a good thing because it’s executed so well.

**Caveats:** This one is kind of a big one. At some point the art nosedives in quality. Shockingly so tbh. It’s still worth reading regardless.

&#x200B;

**1 - Solo Leveling**

**Story Class:** Ranker

**Thoughts:** Solo Leveling. What can I say, it’s the first one I, and most, probably read of the genre. 

It’s a typical ranker story about going into and clearing dungeons, just executed to the nth degree.

The most interesting thing about Solo Leveling is how gradually the story ramps up and how crazy it actually gets, imo. That, and the frankly incredible art. It also makes pretty good use of game UI, which is big praise from me because I usually hate game UI. 

Check it out, it’s good.

**PROS:** Great art, Cool characters, nice plot progression. Unique and well-done main gimmick. MC is pretty badass sometimes.

**Caveats:** Okay, this is important, because I almost dropped Solo Leveling because of this, once upon a time. 

When the MC gets a little bit of power, the poses they choose to draw him in are super edgy and super cringe. However, to combat this you must cast your old self aside and embrace your new edgy, cringe-immune self, and carry on reading. Or else. \* teleports behind you \*

&#x200B;

If you made it this far, I really appreciate it. Gold star for you  ☆ 

Feel free to recommend some that I haven’t read! (Though, I’ve read way more than these but there’s only so much time to write).

Forgotten Manga about a Fantasy Magical School... and Zombies?,"Hey, so this has really been plaguing my mind for ages now, but a couple years ago, I read this short manga set in a medieval fantasy academy which was split into the something like the knight course and the magic course. The protagonist was this red-haired kid in the knight course who wanted to join the magic course since I think he had this special salamander and wanted to learn how to wield it or something (I'm not sure about this part?) and he ends up befriending a boy and girl from the magic course who were also interested about the knights. Anyways, I think someone accidentally opens this evil magic potion jar which ends up causing people to become zombies, >!so the protagonist and his friends end up teaming together and seal away/get rid of the curse.!<

It's a pretty short story and low stakes >!(since I don't think anyone actually dies and the setting is restricted to the academy)!< so I don't think it garnered much popularity but it was a nice story and it irks me that I can't find it anywhere. I tried Baka but I think I keep putting the wrong tags because I can't find it, and if I'm too vague with the tags, I have to look through almost 70 pages worth of series.

Do you know the name of an isekai manga about a girl herbalist/healer in a beautiful forest?,"I am searching for a manga/webtoon for a month now, cannot find it anywhere! I started reading manga/manhua/manhwas a few months ago. I was SO excited to read everything, I would bookmark as I found them.  My bookmark didn't save and I don't remember the title.  

I was hoping someone may recognize the story. 

It seems the novel is recent, gorgeous (full color) artwork, mostly nature and forest scenes. The opening page has a symmetrical double waterfall with beautiful green forests and trees. Very sparkly. 

I read maybe 5-6 chapters before I lost it (I didn't write down the name).  It is about a teen/young adult girl (possibly red/purple hair) who is wandering the forest.  She is a herbalist and healer and of the last of her tribe (something like that).  

It is NOT: 

• ""the golden forest"" manhwa

• snow white, ""Akagami no Shirayukihime"".

• Manta's ""Under the Oak Tree"", haha. 

She comes across a large tree where she meets two beautiful men (who are actually forest spirits disguised as their human form), also on a journey.  

One of the men has dark black hair (possibly long ponytail hair) he is well-dressed (traditional), very pretty. The manga may be slightly historical, I am unsure. 

The men stopped because the black haired one is sick (or got hurt, I forgot). He is very quiet and also stubborn. 

She makes a herbal medicine for him, cares for him overnight while his friend is searching for help. The black haired man gets better in the morning as his friend returns. The friend is very surprised at her talents. 

In the morning they properly introduce each other and all join forces on their journey. That's all I remember.

So I've read up to about halfway through and my thoughts are, it's a very strange book, there's no gratuitous violence or nudity, there's no big baddy reveal in the first few chapters, it's just a regular guy going through life, with the occasional weird occurance/incident thrown in to make you ask questions, it's definitely a slow burn, and like I say I'm only half way through and I've got so many questions, questions about ""friend"" who definitely seems like the villain of the series. Every time I put this book down, I want to pick it back up again and continue reading, like I say its a slow burn, but it's written really well and I highly recommend it.",False,manga,1707854203.0,1aq2txi,

Does anyone know what Otomo's original manga for Stink Bomb and Cannon Fodder were called? (Stinkbomb and Cannon Fodder were segments from his film Memories (1995) based on his own manga),"I recently watched Otomo's film Memories and loved it. After watching it and learning that each segment was based on a manga he wrote, I wanted to read them. I was easily able to figure out that Magnetic Rose was based on his manga called Kanojo No Omoide..., but I've had no luck with Stink Bomb or Cannon Fodder.

I've combed his Wikipedia page and didn't seem to see any of them mentioned there. I saw that Kanojo No Omoide... was turned into a short story collection that got localized as Memories. I figured that the stories had to be in their, but upon closer inspection they don't appear to be. I was able to find a video on YouTube where someone flipped through the book and showed off a bulk majority of the pages. None of the titles in that collection match with theirs, and it doesn't seem like any of the other stories follow their premise. This has lead me to believe that Stink Bomb and Cannon Fodder aren't in that collection at all. Especially when MAL (My Anime List) gives a complete list of all the stories present.

The search for these manga has just made me want to read them more, so I ask of you. If you know what their original names were or even what collection they are in, please let me know!",False,manga,1707849389.0,1aq0thb,

Based on one-shot by Tatsuki Fujimoto

Synopsis: A heart-wrenching single-volume story about the struggles of being an artist, from the creator of Chainsaw Man.

The overly confident Fujino and the shut-in Kyomoto couldn’t be more different, but a love of drawing manga brings these two small-town girls together. A poignant story of growing up and moving forward that only Tatsuki Fujimoto, the creator of Chainsaw Man, could have crafted. (VIZ)

I don't want the typical bad boy, or the super handsome and popular cool womniser senpai.
I don't want the introverted nerd who gets closer to the FL and she sees a unique side of her either.
Sign of Affection and Condition Called Love has a ML that doesn't fall under either of those categories for example. (Granted Condition called love ml isn't really calm and collected but you get the point)

Redo of the healer - a little disturbing at beginning then just nudity all of the time  


metamorphosis - I cannot read this, i am fking weak.  


midori - a fully disturbed creation by a disturbing individual (i believe)  


blue literature - it was pretty good and might considered a 'hidden gem'  


serial experiment lain - i really do wonder why is this thing banned in several countries (it was pretty good tho)  


and the question that i have is 'Why make something so sadistic like redo of the healer and masochistic like midori and 177013 ? Why would writer go out of their way to make a creation that no one asked for ?'

He brings the girl and her friend a boy along. The boy gets trained to be a swordsman and the girl as a magician. The girl is later revealed as some kind of prodegy witch who can use all elemental aspects of magic and was using only nature magic because it strengthened the bindings she had on her soul or something.

Manga where a girl learns that her recently deceased grandmother could bring drawings to life.,"I'm trying to remember the title of a manga where a young black haired girl with is visiting the house of her grandmother (a mansion, more like) who has recently died. I believe said grandmother was the primary person who encouraged the girl's artwork. Somehow, she comes upon a secret space in the house, where she finds drawings by her grandmother, and she manages to bring them to life. One of the drawings is actually of her grandmother, which lets her get some answers about what is going on. She also winds up animating a former servant of her grandmother, a female demon, who served the grandma but then tests the young girl to see if she's worthy. There's a secret society and fighting with drawings. I think the demon drawing was red riding hood demon or something similar. The girl herself is also very talented at art herself.

Find manga?,"I have been trying to find this manga I read more then 10 years ago. It is NSFW and has a lot of sex in it.
It is about a high school boy who is rumoured to have started a relationship with his step mother. His father caught them and left so now the boy and his step mother live together. The boy likes to be under some stairs outside and look up girls skirts. One day he sees a popular girl(maybe the class president?) walk down them and realises she isn't wearing panties. He blackmails her and they start having sex. She calls him a pervert but actually likes it. At the same time he starts a relationship with his physics teacher. I remember a scene where he is listening to music in class and the teacher catches him and takes a headphone to also listen. The girl finds out about the teacher and they have a alteration. The manga ends with the boy coming home to his step mother, confirming the rumors.

It’s a supernatural shounen-ai.

It focuses them later. Boy B lives with his one remaining friend (the one girl he wasn’t really friends with before) and is extremely insecure. This one athlete (I think they were both in baseball) came onto him and later lied saying Boy B tried to harass him.

He has an affair with a girl who turns into a giant cat, she tries to kill him at first but he manages to calm her down. I think they call her the ""hatred cat""  They begin a love-hate relationship.

I also remember that he had a friend who I think was from the ox family, I remember a scene of her killing demons with her father.

Manga Similar to Mato Seihei no Slave – Search Recommendations,"Hi,

I would like to know if you had manga of the same type as Mato Seihei no Slave to suggest to me.

As someone who never read manga, I found this one in November and there are several aspects that I like. For example the fantasy genre, which I often read as a novel, the very well-realized characters (to the point that it is not easy to choose a favorite character), the varied powers, the uniforms (I find them so classy), the universe, fights and history. The principle of rewards is, of course, a big bonus, but ultimately it's the whole thing that I really like. The ecchi and nudity side is quite balanced without taking up too much space.

It's a relatively specific manga and I don't know if there's anything even remotely similar. I don't know if there's anything else that would interest me as much, but you never know.

Forgotten Middle School Manga,"[ SOLVED, It was Arata: The Legend] Please I need help finding the name of this manga I once read in middle school. It was about two boys who swapped worlds. I think one was a prince in a magical dimension and the other was just a normal high school boy. I remember at the start of the book on the fantasy side before the swap the prince was pretending to be a princess to dodge a ceremony or something. Maybe he wasn’t a prince but that’s why I think he was. The fantasy side was about magic swords. I forget if it was kind of like soul eater where people were weapons or if a person just had a strong weapon they were bound to but for some reason the normal boy who’s now in this world is going around fighting these people who rule with their swords and I think he gains their power once he defeats them. I believe the name was only one word but if any names ring a bell please let me know. 
It’s just been nagging me recently. I only read them physically rented from the library and I remember this one kid always pointed out and flipped to the pages where the series had ecchi fan service pages and he always mashed the name with something inappropriate but I forget what it was.

In Praise of Comedy (also recommend your favourite comedy manga!),"I am someone who doesn't really do lists or rankings, but some of my friends were talking about their top 10s, 3x3s etc, and I thought, what the hell, let's give it a shot. At first I caught myself trying to make a ""perfect""/ ""objective"" list, and looking at it I just knew it wasn't really MY top 10. So I decided to just go through everything that I have read and rate them honestly based on my enjoyment, and it struck me how much of what I truly love is unexpectedly in the comedy genre. Thing is, I love ""heavy"" media (for lack of a better term) that have layers of themes and meanings with rich and complex characterization and relationships, something that you can sink your teeth into and analyse, pick apart and philosophize about endlessly. Weird and experimental stuff is also totally my jam. So you would think my Top 10 would be filled with drama with some highbrow artsy stuff sprinkled in...

But this is what I settled on:

Grand Blue

Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun

D-frag!

Chainsaw Man

Daily Lives of Highschool Boys

Monster

Angel Densetsu

Berserk

Machida-kun no Sekai

Vagabond

I surprised myself, but then thinking about it, it makes sense. While the intellectually challenging stuff is great, it is a ""luxury"", in the sense that I can only fully enjoy them when all the basic needs are met, i.e. when I am in a good state of mind. If I am feeling down and depressed on the ride home, I can't just crack open Berserk or Monster and just start reading and appreciate them fully. That's where the comedy manga comes in, open it up anytime, anyplace for a pick-me-up and to push the darkness away. And it's like, while analysing and philosophizing gives its own kind of happiness, nothing can beat the pure delight that a good comedy manga can give. So this is just a post to appreciate these gems which I feel I have underappreciated due to my snobiness.

I know someone here will have an answer.,"Maybe my brain has turned to mush, or I'm seriously confusing multiple stories into one. So here it goes... I'm trying to remember the title to a story about a FL, that reincarnated/regressed into her past. I believe in her past life she was married off to her first husband for political reasons. I think her first husband went to a war? She eventually remarried another man who was a mage and had a son with him. The husband took the son and disappeared. Which obviously made her very sad. 

She eventually married a third time which according to her memories he was distant and rarely spoke to her. I think he may of been known to her for many years though and seemed to genuinely care for her. I remember she ended up in a dungeon and either dies at her own hand or someone else. The third husband seems to rush to her side at the last moment. Possibly asking her to wait. 


In her current time I believe she is attempting to help her third husband for a bigger revenge story arc. Her third husband also possibly has or had a stutter. Possibly why he was distant towards her in the previous time line. She may of also of been pregnat at the time of her death.

Pandorahearts Book Summaries,"Hi!

I'm reading my first ever mangas and it's the pandorahearts series. I've read 1 and found it enjoyable, although learning to read manga (I.e opposite directions to what's standard for me) was and still is difficult.

I've just finished book 2 and I feel a bit confused. I sometimes find it hard to follow. It jumps between past and present a lot. I find this hard to be on track with, and I often find it hard to discern who's talking or what order I should follow the panels. I really want to like this manga, but still very confused.

I noticed there's a lack of summaries of each book and I feel like they would help me memorise the important details. I found a guy on reddit who summarised the first book and it helped me a lot to understand, follow and appreciate the book. I can't find any for 2, making my memories of what i read a bit jumbled!

I will start 3 today, hoping more pieces of the puzzle are given to help me string it together. 

Would anyone care to direct me to, or summarise themselves book 2 and maybe 3 for me? This'll help me I think, but it's totally coop if it's too much to ask.

Is the Tokyopop translation of Ikki Tousen *actually* bad?,"I started reading series recently and I’m surprised to find myself loving it. I’m asexual, so the fanservice doesn’t do anything for me, but I’m actually pretty invested in the plot and the characters.
 
I’ve been reading the official English translation, since I’m pretty sure that’s the only one available, and have really enjoyed it. It’s genuinely funny and I feel like the way the characters talk adds to just how shameless the series is. Every now and then, there will be a reference that I’m pretty sure doesn’t exist in the Japanese version, but I’m assuming they’re adding those in place of other references that English audiences wouldn’t understand. Certain people in this community love to go on about how localisation is a crime against humanity and absolutely nothing should be changed, but those people don’t understand how translation actually works.
 
However, I just found out that apparently people generally agree this is a bad translation, and makes *lots* of unnecessary changes and jokes that there aren’t equivalents for in the original. I can’t read Japanese too well and I don’t know about other translations, so I can’t confirm this for myself. I realise this is a pretty niche series, but I was wondering if someone could weigh in on whether it’s really that bad? It would be a shame to drop the series, but so would reading a watered down product.

Searching for a forgotten manhua,"It's a Chinese manhua, where a girl dies, and in the afterlife, she meets angels that states that they can allow for her to return to her original world if she does a test run for reincarnation for them. She has to make the male lead of each world fall in love with her, and it is also a completed series, but I forgot what name of the manhua.

Slight spoilers, but content to see if it helps in finding it:

\-The male lead of each world turns out to be the same guy the whole time, just in a different body, but he doesn't remember the previous world, and by the end, it turns out that both are from the sam original world, and they meet each other not long after returning, and became a couple.

The reason for this thread's existence is the fact that both requests and suggestions became kind of stale. It's supposed to bring out more manga that is not RTed or recommended. Also, it's quite useful for the discussion of not so current titles.

Also, not a rule or any kind of criticism, the more interesting part is not the list of the stuff you read, but your impressions of it.

The mc doesnt like how his class works but still does it because he doesnt see any other way of getting stronger because without killing his party he remains at level one, in other words he needs to constantly get a new party to kill, he isnt the only one of his class that exists, there seem to be many of them and they seem to be trained since childhood.

"Looking for the manga that I read 6-9 years ago, please help me find it.","( I'm not good with english so sorry in advance if my grammar is not correct, thank you)

I was browsing in facebook and suddenly remember the manga i read years ago, I think I was 10-12 years old when I read that manga, i'm not really sure since that was long time ago.

So about this manga I will only tell the scenes that i remember, it's not clear tho so it's not accurate but i hope you can help me find it since i really want to reread it again.

There is a male lead, he has dark hair i think and wearing glasses, i think he is still a student and he has a brother (im not sure), he is just walking and then suddenly he passed by in a street where someone is fighting..... (fast forward, i don't remember the next) , he met a girl who is good with katanas, the girl was raised up in a dojo, and is still living there, i think the girl is also his classmate that don't go too often in school since she go out and fight most of the time ( again, im not sure sorry, lets fast forward the story ), he has superpowers ( i'm not sure if he knows, he hide it, or he don't know, i don't remember sorry 😭) his super powers is super strong, maybe its already obviously since he is the male lead, sorry i don't remember what power he has ( fast forward again ), he met people that has super powers , ( i think i remember now, he can imitate the powers of others, not sure again ),  so the people that i remember that he met is, 

1. The girl in wheel chair (not sure if she's really in wheel chair
2. Man with apple head
3. The cat in a suit/clothes
4. Immortal man ( i think he is wearing a military clothing)

That's all i can remember, there is more but i don't remember now

So the last chapter that i read that i remember tho im not sure again is when they formed an alliance with the people he met, then they have war, he fights , that's where i remember those character , the cat with clothes , the man that has immortality power, and the girl in a wheel chair

That's what i remember, sorry if my story is not clear, i'm not really sure of the story since i read more manga and i think my mind was messed up and im confused,  so im not really sure about it, but i hope you can help me, thank you ❤️",False,manga,1707660599.0,1ao8s3d,

Can't find this villainess manhwa again,"Edit: solved!

I read a story a while back that was in early chapters and I guess I never added it to my mal or bookmarks cuz I can't find it again

It's a villainess manhwa about a girl getting reincarnated into a tragedy she read, and the character she becomes is this little girl with purple hair who gets adopted into a powerful family where the potential heirs are encouraged to destroy each other to prove their worth. The protagonist was adopted to prove to the biological children that nothing is guaranteed, and if they don't quit acting entitled then an orphan off the street might take their birthright

I think she also gets some kind of power that makes her eyes turn red.

There were only 11 chapters when I read it so that's all the identifying details I've got. Is anyone familiar with this one?",False,manga,1707658051.0,1ao7xzh,I Played The Role Of The Adopted Daughter Too Well

So, the protagonist is an alcoholic model with silver hair and a terrible character. He's despised by everyone and hated by his co-workers. He meets a brown hair guy who owns the hotel where he is taking pictures (almost drawn in the swimming pool due to the heat).
Those two are gonna expose the protagonist's boss who is obsessed with him, his muse (Actually, he took the protagonist as a model because his father, the real muse, didn't want to do it. But they look alike). The art tends to make an excessive set of teeth when the protagonist is upset (often).

Finding a manga,"Back in 2022 or ‘23, a manga was on my feed on tt. I remembered about it and decided to read it but I don’t remember what it was called. 
  The manga was about  three childhood friends (2 boys, one girl) together but the one boy went away. Fast forward, the boy in the group liked a new girl , but turns out the boy that went away was their friend. He transitioned to a girl. The manga was about the boy having a sexuality crisis since he liked a girl who was a guy. The trans girl proceeds to go for him and have these feelings type for him? I just know that there was a shower scene which was pretty weird. The girl liked the boy before he transitioned and asked him why he did it. In the end of the story the cis boy and trans girl like each other in the end. 

   That’s all I remember. But idk if this will help. Ik it’s some physiological thing since I heard it you give you a type of identity crisis. Anyways I hope you can help me. Please and thanks :)",True,manga,1707623414.0,1anysbj,

Also she put on cursed equipment that would usually give you a status debuff but gave a status buff for her instead.
Healing spells also got reversed I think i.e. she took damage instead.

It was very gory, it was a group of dudes that investigated crimes, the most prominent feature that i can remember from them was that one had a Punk looking hairstyle,a bdsm ball on his mouth and would kiss the dead to find out how they died.


Last thing i remember from it was the end of the first volume,where the group was brought to an island at night where there was a lot of people performing a ritual of sorts,they got their faces covered and after taking the hoods off everyone else on the island was dead on a pretty gruesome scene.

I cant remember much but the story was about a girl and a guy who go around helping people with their problem. The genre is horror/mystery.

One of the story that I remember was there was this girl who wanted to be pretty so that she can confessed to her crush. The MC gave her an apple, and told her to bite and and it will make her pretty. But she must keep the apple even tho its gonna be rotten. Long story short, the girl becomes pretty and was about to kiss her crush. But then, her mom saw the apple that she been keep on her room, and destroyed the rotten apple. Because of that, when she about to kiss her crush, her face becomes ugly and melting.

Im sorry if its kinda confusing since english its not my first language.

Hajime No Ippo Creator Speaks Against Anime Studios Tweaking The Original Plot Of Manga,"On February 7, the author of popular manga Hajime No Ippo, George Morikawa, reaffirmed his unwavering support for the rights of people who created their original creative works via a Twitter post.

In the post, he expresses that it is important to preserve the author’s creative vision, and they will always believe that they will always have a final say in it.

He also highlights that the purpose of the laws is to protect the proprietary rights and authority of the original writers in their work.

Morikawa states that although readers, editors, and adaptators could shed light on previously published materials, only the original creator knows the future of the story.

For this reason, they should have complete control over their work.

He further states that the original artists might be given the freedom to exercise their legal rights to the unrestricted maintenance of their intellectual properties.

Morikawa, however, also indirectly targeted anime studios for changing or adding their interpretation to the manga creator’s work.

***“The reason is absolute because the original author is absolute. Just as before, this message is also for aspiring manga artists. Despite facing backlash, authors have continuously asserted their absolute authority. The rights of primary creators, including manga artists, novelists, and screenwriters, are protected by law. And what’s crucial is that only the original author knows the future. That’s why it’s absolute.***

***Everything that editors and adaptors, including readers, see, is already in the past. Only the original author knows what the future holds. This is even more true if the series is still ongoing and unfinished. Any alteration, intervention, or adaptation of the past will erode the present and affect the future. That is why it is important to discuss and give your opinion. What is needed is respect, gratitude, and courage, not an overbearing attitude. The future that the work and its readers look forward to should not be ruined or lost because of the bending of others who only know the past. Only the author can protect the work’s future.”***",False,manga,1707564190.0,1ane7su,

He also ends up getting a little demon girl on his team but demons are killed so they hide her horn with a ribbon. This is possible spoiler but he finds out if you kill the demon king the world is reset and he doesn’t want that to happen so he doesn’t kill the demon king.

Manga Collecting,"Wassup reddit, this is my first post ever and I wanted to ask y'all if you have some recommendations for me!  
I started watching anime a few years ago but I only started reading manga on 2023.  
I've watched a few anime (Berserk \[90's version\], Hellsing ultimate, AoT, Demon Slayer, Inuyashiki, Undead Unluck, Jjk, Mob Psycho 100, 91 days, Chainsaw MAn, Death Note, Deadman Wonderland, Banana Fish, Biao Ren and many others...) but because I've only started reading manga a couple of months ago my collection is still slim. I've got all of Death Note Black editions, Monster 1st vol. , 3 Tokyo Ghoul Vol., 3 jjk Vol, One Punch Man also 3 Vol. , Gannibal 1st vol., Uzumaki, Chainsaw man 12 vol., and a couple of more mangas that were translated to portuguese (samurai and shinobi stories like 'O preço da desonra' and 'Butterfly Beast'). I've tried to get my hands on Dorohedoro and Inuyashiki but it's hard. I've read all the mangas I have (except I'm only now finishing Monster vol.1).  
I've read Fire Punch online and I absolutely loved it. I also love Chainsaw Man.   
So, you've seen I kinda like R rated mangas and gore and stuff like that, so do you have any recommendations for me?
