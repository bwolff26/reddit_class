"Birthdays, blood types, and measurements",Discussion,"Supplementary information like this is often available about anime and manga characters: birthday, blood type, height, weight, favorite food, waist-hip. It’s not always described by characters explicitly, but often listed in blurbs next to chapter titles, or at the start/end of tankoban/LNs; sometimes from other sources (games, ads, licensed snack foods…) but still presumably from the mouth of the author/creator(s). I don’t think the majority of anime do it, but compared to Western media I think they do it much more often.

I want to get into an anime because I'm trying to learn Japanese. Are there any you would think even somebody like me would enjoy?

I watched Homunculus on Netflix, live action of an anime I think I seen. I thought that was an amazing movie despite poor reviews. I like Psychological Thrillers, but not into romance and action.
I love Mystery and trippy movies like Baeu is Afraid, or David Lynch films. I like great dialog. i watch boring movies with little talking and action such as No Country For Old Men.

"I watched ""Gegege no Nazo"".",Discussion,"I watched it 3 weeks ago and was great.

The movie is a prequel explaining how Kitaro was born.

Gegege no Kitaro is very famous Youkai anime in japan. It aired its first season in 1969 and its sixth in 2018. The character designs change with each season, and the story also changes with the times. I love season 5 especially. 

The movie had an eerie and unique plot in the first half and many battle scenes in the second half. I especially like the first half of the plot!!

You don't need any prior knowledge of Kitaro to enjoy this movie, so be sure to watch it when it starts streaming. The movie was a very big hit in Japan.",False,anime,1708436730.0,1avhzoi
Question for JJK fans.,Discussion," I haven't seen JJK but am fascinated by the people who are positive in the fandom. I love the music from the show and the characters seem interesting just based on the amount of memes, videos and things I've seen about them.   
But I do have a question. How do you handle being attached to these characters knowing they are going to die and nothing is guaranteed as far as seeing them go on to the next season? What makes you stick around. What keeps you invested? This is purely out of curiosity. I personally couldn't handle watching something and getting attached to a character knowing they are going to die if I'm a manga reader or seeing characters die every week as an anime only fan.   
Feel free to spoil me with your thoughts and feelings. I don't think my heart could handle watching the show so I'm happy to listen to other people talk about it openly. ",False,anime,1708436391.0,1avhv9w

He befriends a women on the island who had her arm cut off by one of the original guys , therefore she can never leave the island .

Should I watch oshi no ko?,Help,"I've been a fan of manga/anime since I was a little kid & I'm 30 now. Still, I try to avoid animes with female characters who try to be cute so I tend to just watch fighting ones with a male mc. I tried watching oshi no ko ep 1, but couldn't finish it. I could feel my interest leaving my body with each second. However, I've been humbled many times when judging manga/anime for their first ep/chapter. Since this series is so popular, does it get better? Will it get dark and serious? Is the mc's charm just being aloof & 'cute'? Is it only popular because the fanbase is made up of mostly male viewers? I've heard that it's one of the animes with the best 1st ep, but I felt like it got more and more boring with each second. Please tell me, should I watch this & endure? If yes, why? What's so good about it? (NO SPOILERS.)",False,anime,1708427276.0,1avf4ya

Looking for a tall girl x short boy anime name,Help,"The show came around with Komi doesn’t communicate and The Dangers in my Heart I think. Could be H, or not. I’m pretty sure the setting was in school. And the girl could be a gyaru. Nevertheless her inner monologue was bubbly. 

I remember when the girl first sees the boy she gets real flustered and thinks something like ‘oh crap, this is bad, I wanna bone him!’ And he thinks the same thing. They might be the same age? But the boy was really short. I’m not sure what else happens in the episode but that stuck on my mind clearly.

What are the weirdest interpretations or fallacies you've heard about your favorite shows?,Discussion,"
We've all seen some very strange interpretations or claims about different anime shows...from popular shows like Naruto to Jujutsu Kaisen to Attack on Titan to One Piece and so forth...that you sometimes shake your head and wonder how people came up with these.

I'll start:

JUJUTSU KAISEN:

""The power system in Jujutsu Kaisen makes no sense"" - No, it makes sense. Everything form domain expansion to innate domain to domain amplification to simple domain and so forth is properly explained in the show. If you don't understand an explanation simply rewind and rewatch the scene till you get it


NARUTO:

""Naruto became bad or should have ended after the Pain arc"" - No it shouldn't. A lot of plot points remained unsolved. Even neverminding the inconsistencies of the war arc, after the Pain arc we still had good arcs like the 5 Kage submit, the Naruto training with Killer Bee and taming the 9 tails. Even the war arc had some 10/10 moments and some poor moments too...


ATTACK ON TITAN:

[Attack on Titan spoilers] >!""Eren became a bird"" - 😂😂😂 I still laugh anytime I see this. I'm still not sure if they're trolling or being serious. Literally the most basic symbolism in the show to show that Eren became free in death and is watching over his friends suddenly gets interpreted as Eren became a bird...wtf!<


[Attack on Titan spoilers] >!""Eren doesn't know why he did the Rumbling"" - I wonder what he was saying to Armin the entire conversation then. Imagine having an entire 10 minutes worth of conversation explaining about 4 different reasons for the Rumbling...and then someone misinterpretes a random line where he talks about not understanding the reason his nature is one that seeks freedom...How TF do you ignore 10 minutes worth of dialogue and come up with this?!<

""Attack on Titan should have ended after the basement reveal"" - No it shouldn't. Season 4 was literally the best season storywise. Just because you don't like the change in genre doesn't render the whole story pointless


ONE PIECE:

""One Piece gets good after 200+ episodes"" - No that's false. One piece is good from the start. It only gets better and better. You don't need 200 episodes for it to get good.",False,anime,1708423447.0,1ave65b

"I just saw this ""strongest isekai characters so far in 2024"" ranking and omg it couldn't be more wrong...",Discussion,"So, there's five people on the list. Yogiri from Sokushi Cheat..., Usato from Chiyuu Mahou no Machigatta Tsuikata, Yumiella from Ura Boss Level 99, Misumi from TsukiMichi, and the protagonist if Ishura. I'm seeing all of these except Ishura (sorry I forgot the dudes name). The ranking I saw, from 1st to 5th, goes like this. Yogiri>Soujiro>Misumi>Usato>Yumiella.

I get Yogiri topping them all. He's insanely OP with that ability of his. I maybe get Misumi being above Yumiella, he's also pretty damn OP. But HOW do you put USATO over Yumiella??? Like, bruh, Yumiella's magic is insanely destructive and she herself is stronger than Rose (physically speaking), and if you say Usato has healing? Yumiella can grow back an arm!! She's also good at using it on others!! Removing the Ishura guy, I'd rank them Yogiri>Yumiella, Misumi (they're pretty even matched imo)>Usato.

What do yall think?",False,anime,1708421880.0,1avds1b
Why does fanservice on male characters make them look so cool?,Discussion,"Since I've started watching Solo Levelling, I cannot help but feel like the MC of the show has some of the coolest glow-ups that I have seen in a while. After he gained some muscle through rigorous training, I saw plenty of close-up ab shots of his body to show how far he had changed physically from the first episode to the latest episode . Those scenes make him look extremely cool.

When some of my favorite male characters do sexually suggestive poses voluntarily, it does give me genuine excitement which I don't get from boob/butt fanservice of female characters. Is it just me who falls into this experience when it comes to fanservice?

However, I am hooked! I haven’t watched anime since I was a teen, which was many years ago. I stopped watching because I felt like the anime I was watching didn’t deal with mature themes. Here’s what I would like to look for in an anime:

- Something for an older target audience 
- Something with complex social, psychological, or gripping themes 
- Not something that has like 100 or more episodes. Something realistic I can finish! This was a huge bonus finding out Death Note only has 37 episodes.
- Something with good pacing and doesn’t slog their plot lines 
- Preferably either no, *or light* supernatural themes (Although this criteria can be excluded if the anime is interesting enough - I’m just not generally too into supernatural or science-fiction)",False,anime,1708421213.0,1avdmbi

Last year I've watched pretty much all recent anime movies on Netflix and outside of it.

I've watched all the biggest hits: all Ghibli movies obviously, Words Bubble Up Like Soda Pop, Fortune Favors Lady Nikuko (in my top 3 anime movies of all time!), Drifting Home, House of the Lost on the Cape etc.

A few days ago I've stumbled upon ""Chie The Brat"" from 1981 and really, really enjoyed. I therefore decided to maybe watch some older anime movies from the 80s & 90s similar to the once mentioned above.

Would anyone have any recommendations of anime movies like that? I'd really appreciate some suggestions :).

The scene started with a soldier on a battlefield and everyone is dead. He hears an enemy giant talking and the giant tells him something along the lines of “you’ve beaten us now something even worse will come for you” he kills the giant and then hears a woman talking it’s his commander and she’s dying propped up against a rock. They talk and she says something about she’s failed again and then an angel appears and hurls magic at them about to kill the two and she leans in and spits a marble into his mouth. 

Then the clip ended. If anyone can identify it and let me know if it’s worth the time thank you.

I really just have no interest in the characters except for like two and the actual fights which everyone raves about really aren’t that great to me.

The animation is amazing but just the actual powers and everything is really hard to be hyped about.

Anime where MC reincarnates into the future (same world),Help,"Hey, I've been searching for this anime I watched and I cannot remember what it's called and everything I try to look up ends up being reincarnation into a different world.

It's been a while and I can't remember the exact specifics, but I vividly remember a scene where I want to say the love interest is kidnapped and taken to a mountain, and the mc has to come save her. If I remember correctly, the mc has some sword or power from his dead wife or lover from a past life (I'm 75% certain it was a past life and not just in his past). I think he was a hero or a king in his past life and he gave up his life or something to seal away the enemy that comes back and kidnaps the girl in the scene i remember. It's set in a fantasy world 

Edit: I may have mixed some anime together in my head, but I know specifically I am looking for a show I know I watched where the main character some how gets powers from a dead lover/wife/girlfriend that I'm pretty sure manifests as like a golden silhouette.

Looking for an anime movie for 10 years now,Help,"Hi I created this account only because I’m very desperate. I watched this movie on YouTube when there was no copyright moderation about anime on the platform and I only have blurry memories. The graphics were great and not in an old style like ""Perfect Blue"" but more like ""When Marnie was there"". 

The scenario unfolded in a futuristic Japan where everyone had some kind of system in the head that prevented any kind of trauma (like if someone bleed they won’t be able to see clearly and their vision will be blurred or glitched). Then an unknown organization hacks the system and triggers a wave of su!c!dal and hyper violent behavior among everyone. 
We’re following the pov of a japanese girl who lost her best friend an european girl (maybe russian) in a double su!c!de (in high school) where she was the only one to escape because she didn’t take enough medecine (she feels very bad about that because she was in love with her bff) 
She seeks to discover who is behind the massive hack and realize that it is her bff who didn’t died and wants everyone being traumatized because in her childhood in Russia (not sure) she’s been rape and torture by soldiers. 
I don’t remember the end but I remember a scene where a friend of the main character sticks a fork in her eyes because of the hack while they’re brunch.

Crest and Banner of the Stars 25th Anniversary Rewatch Announcement,Rewatch,"# Crest / Banner of the Stars &mdash; Seikai no Senki 25th Anniversary Rewatch Announcement

I will be starting the first of two 1999 sci-fi rewatches in mid-march: the romance / war epic series Banner of the Stars! In one sentence, I would summarize it as Spice and Wolf crossed with Legend of Galactic Heroes.  After several centuries of disjointed colonization and the rise and fall of petty empires, the galaxy has become divided into 5 major powers, who are in the process of annexing the last remaining independent systems.  Major conflict is inevitable.

Seikai no Senki, aka Banner (or Battleflag) of the Stars, is a light novel series by Hiroyuki Morioka. As a contrast to 1990s epic Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Banner of the Stars remains focused on a particular pair of participants: Lafiel Abriel and Jinto Lyn.  The existing animated materials follows them from their meeting, through a number of campaigns in intergalactic war, and wrapping up at a nice stopping point with an epilogue / coda.

The series is also notable for its extensive world building.  Unfortunately, not much translated material, mostly hosted on fansites, remains after 20 years. As anime-only viewers, we are limited to what the show presents to us. However, if world building is your thing, are rabbit holes to follow: the Abh nation, history and culture, the physics of interstellar travel, and Morioka's constructed language of Baronh.

The first series, Crest of the Stars, was shown on G4/Tech TV and was very popular in North America, leading to Bandai making and releasing two additional 1 cour adaptations.  Tokyopop picked up the light novels, but tokyopop being tokyopop, didn't follow through. (Hey! I did my part! I bought my copy!) This would have been our best record of the background details.  I hope source readers will pop in with details not in the anime.

This show has something for everyone!  However, if you're looking for just one thing, the show many seem unfocused. By the time we get to the second season, we have a vastly expanded cast.  We have exciting battles in space! But throughout it all, we also have extended conversations between two or three people.  The show is very talky.  In some ways, it's a well animated radio drama.  (I have several such CDs. They are much like a condensed audio track of the TV series!)  Ultimately, the show is focused on the characters and not the greater events. And yes, [there is a couple.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oSIr4r9Cv4)

This will be my first rewatch in quite some time.  I will provide extras from my DVDs where applicable, although so far they seem to be basic details already presented in the anime itself (and somewhat prematurely).

I'm also not one for long series and long rewatches, but this one is worth it. I had only intended to run a rewatch of the first cour, from 1999, but somebody in the interest thread asked about the others.  My two responses to this were, ""why not"" and ""why wait""?  We should watch it all in one batch.  The entire series runs 39 episodes.  Here is how it breaks down:

###Rewatch Dates:
March 18 - April 30

###Series Discussion:
April 30

###Posting Schedule
Index tables will be in the reminder thread.  As a gift to our European friends, I will attempt a **2 pm PDT** posting time, as allowed by my working schedule (previously I was posting at 3 pm). The USA will be on daylight saving time after March 10.  That is 9 pm UTC, and 10 pm CET. I think I'll wait until March to figure out the Australian time.

###Availability

Banner of the Stars was re-licensed by Funimation after the closure of Bandai Entertainment, so Crunchyroll is probably the go-to place for streaming.  No promises that Funimation will still be streaming in March.

* [Crunchyroll Franchise Link](https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GVDHX8QXW/crest-of-the-stars)
* [Funimation Franchise Link](https://www.funimation.com/shows/crest-of-the-stars-/?qid=)
* [Amazon Season 1](https://www.amazon.com/Crest-of-the-Stars/dp/B07KMKDSVD) (marked as unavailable to me)

Crunchy and Funi mark the OVA as a prequel and slot it first into season 1...it is best watched after the first season.  Since it is a side story, I've moved it to the otherwise anemic season 4 discussion.

Thanks to Vaadwaur for suggesting the start date, it works nicely.

Anime and music synchronisation ?,What to Watch?,"I recently realized how much I was susceptible to this specific thing in anime where the music syncs up perfectly with the scene I'm watching (it doesn't have to be in a fight exclusively but generally), and I just get this powerful rush of emotions that gets me to watch the scene again and again. 

This feeling is what makes me like MHA so much, here it's the general feeling of epicness with a powerful OST, voice acting, emotional build up that really works on me. Although the animation isn't as good as other shonen like Demon slayer or JJK, it still gets so much more points for me because it does it a little bit better than them.

"Anyone else think Revenger (2023) took the easy way out, instead of being a truly good anime?",Discussion,"I don't really see this one being talked about a lot, but the show is quite solid. And yet, my only problem (which unfortunately is a big one) is on the Revengers' philosophy. 

There are pretty much three ways to see what ribenjis are doing:

1) Coins are sacred. We are God's men, and it is our duty to satisfy His children's grudges, and take on their sins.

2) This is literally a formality, all I care about is being paid and to look cool while doing it.

3) Revenge is wrong. People can change, if given the chance.

None of these views can coexist. It's fine to progress from one to another (Soji), but believing whatever is convenient at the time will not suffice.

However, that's exactly what the show does at the end. There is no correct answer to the question ""What to do with Kurima Raizo?"". You either honour Yui's pain and hatred and kill Raizo (1). Or kill Raizo cause you were paid and don't care much more than that (2). Or decide to spare Raizo because he repented, and decide to ignore the church (3).

And yet, the show decides ""It'll be fine"" and says ideas 1 and 3 can coexist. Spare Raizo, spit in the face of Yui's hatred because they believe he changed and repented, and that the church is wrong. But also keep working for the church because the hatred embedded on the coins is sacred. 

And they do this throughout the show. White-hair dude seems like the most devout worshipper out of all of them, and yet he's happy to shield Raizo on his own discretion, lie to the church and so on. Sometimes the gang will accept that a coin is just a coin and it doesn't matter who bit it, sometimes they'll say the grudge matters and using a loophole to have a random guy bite the coin so they have an excuse to serve revenge is wrong.

Instead of making the characters face a tough choice, they get away with not having to make any. Some random kid kills Raizo, and I guess there's that. ""What goes around comes around"" what a sick joke. The gang keeps doing revenges as though nothing happened, promising to never 'cheat like this again' (??? it doesn't work that way).

Such a bafflingly half-assed solution to a fascinatingly well crafted premise. It's like they knew what they were supposed to do without understanding why they were supposed to do it. It's not over whether Raizo survives or not, it's whether the characters decide Revenge is right or not.",False,anime,1708379882.0,1auzzz6

I like JDM cars and the culture around them. One thing g that keeps coming up again and again in that scene is how many people watched and were inspired by initial D.

Recommendations for my son and I (new to the genre),What to Watch?,"I have a son (15) who I think would enjoy anime movies/shows but hasn't really ever been into watching TV or movies (at least not since being a little kid, once he discovered video games he was on that path pretty much alone). I am hoping to get some recommendations for anime that we could watch together and see if he likes. 

In general he likes Japanese culture so I think it will be a good fit... but admittedly a lot of that is because of his love of the food. He loves RPG video games, but primarily western ones so far (he doesn't like turn based stuff as much yet so I might try and see if he likes some action RPG ones), for example, anything Bethesda Game Studio. In the past he did love Ni No Kuni and has played pretty much all the Pokémon games (but not as much lately) as well as the Zelda games.

When he was into Ni No Kuni I had him watch a couple of the Studio Ghibli films with me and they were ok for him, but I think he was a little young still at that point. I could try again.

I watched some back in the day, like the older Studio Ghibli stuff before the early 2000s and things like Vampire Hunter D and (I think it was called) Record of Lodoss War, but it has been a long time.

Gushing over Magical Girls is well-written,Discussion,"Tl;dr in advance: Don't judge a book by it's cover. 

Ever since Gushing over Magical Girls - or Mahou Shoujo ni Akogarete - started airing, it has been the subject of many heated discussions, but I've seen one take about this show that I consider to be wrong and that is: ""This anime is just porn. It's not well written and people only like it because it's ecchi.""

First of all, no, this anime is not ""just porn"". Aside from the ecchi content there is a lot to like about it. Whether it's the story, the characters, the themes, the comedy, the voice acting or the fun subversion of the magical girl genre and it's tropes, Gushing over Magical Girls has a lot of good things to offer, but I want to focus on the writing in particular, specifically the character writing, which is usually the first aspect fans of the series mention when they talk about what they enjoy about Mahoako. 

The term ""well written"" is pretty vague, but I'd say a character is generally well written when they are:

* **consistent and believable**, meaning their actions make sense in the context of how the character was previously established. If a character has clearly established beliefs, goals or motivations, then their actions have to align with those or the character won't feel believable or ""real"". 
* **invoke emotions in us**, whether it's love, hate or more conflicted feelings, if a character makes us care about them, I think it's a strong sign that they are well written. 
* **serving the story they are in**, meaning they fit into the story and make it more engaging for the viewer. They don't necessarily have to have depth or complex motivations. If the character fits into the story and if their presence and interactions improve the work they're in, then I think that's another sign of them being well written. 
* **relatable**, meaning we can look at them and see at least some part of ourselves in them or find some traits of them relatable, whether they are good or bad. I think this point is more important for the protagonist of a story and not a requirement for every character to be considered well written.

The characters in Gushing over Magical Girls fulfill all of these criteria. They are all interesting and engaging and their dynamics are enjoyable. All of them have clear, discernible traits, such as strengths, weaknesses and personalities that define them well. And the main character Utena isn't just consistent, entertaining and relatable, but she also has layers, meaning she isn't one-dimensional and more than just a sadist who likes to humiliate Magical Girls. The latest episode, episode 7, presented her complexity as a character very well. 

And even though the story is mostly character-driven and the beginning is episodic, there is also a good plot and even some intrigue about the mascot character and their role in the story. There are also interesting themes in this anime, like the theme of self-discovery, which the characters are going through when they explore their various kinks. 

And last but not least the comedy is genuinely great too and there are a lot of people who watch and enjoy this anime mainly because it's funny. Writing and executing good comedy is not easy, so the author and the anime staff deserve some credit for making Gushing over Magical Girls as hilarious as it is. 

Now, this should be obvious, but Gushing over Magical Girls is definitely not for everyone and I would never recommend this show to someone who dislikes ecchi or who feels uncomfortable with the premise of the story or it's fetish content. However, just because an anime doesn't appeal to you, doesn't mean it's not well written. There are reasons why this series has become very popular very quickly and it's not just because of the excellent marketing, but also because it's a good ecchi/comedy anime with well written characters. 

What's your opinion? Do you agree or disagree with my take? Also, I know this anime is controversial, but please keep the discussion civil.

looking for a good romance anime - i'm picky,What to Watch?,"i was watching a lot of anime years ago but had a long break so please recommend me only anime that came out during the last 4 years, no older as i probably watched them already
- i'd like something with a healthy, mature and wholesome relationship between the main characters + cute scenes that will give me butterflies (i'm okay with GL and BL)
- i want romance to be the main plot so i'd prefer no action, thriller or fantasy going on unless they're really slight
- also no harem & no ecchi
- for the reference, my favorite romance anime are kimi no na wa & howl's moving castle. i also just started ""a sign of affection"" and really like it",False,anime,1708366377.0,1auu5p1
Looking for an anime!,Help,"Hey, so. My girlfriend told me about an anime series she watched on youtube around 2016-2017. The things she remembers are that the protagonist was a girl that could travel around dimensions and that the actual protagonist was a guy that had a big hat with a watch on it. She is pretty sure that the guy also had white hair and a cape.  
The characters were mostly humane, but some of them had tails. That's everything she's told me.  
If by some miracle anyone knows the name of the anime, i'd be beyond grateful. Thanks in advance!!",False,anime,1708366132.0,1auu1s0

The Roboworld people in Redline had a point.,Misc.,"The bad guys from Roboworld are ugly, macho, and obviously designed to look like cyborg space Nazis. But honestly if a bunch of criminals bring heavy ammunition and into a street race that starts in a DMZ and finishes inside a country's top-secret military base, and livestream the whole thing, they have nobody to blame for themselves for getting blown up.

Roboworld is working on illegal biological weapons tech. But that princess alien from Supergrass showed up on their base and used powerful magic. Supergrass hired criminals to sabotage Roboworld's conventional weapons to protect the illegal race, and sponsored racers, two of whom were their own princesses. Its entirely plausible that the race was intended to spy on or sabotage the Roboworld military while less openly breaching the treaty. Roboworld is not the only one breaking the rules of war, and its understandable to want a trump card under the circumstances.

Whenever Roboworld uses lethal force in the movie, its because terrorists are committing crimes on their sovereign soil and refuse to surrender.

Its probable that they displaced people to force them to live on that crappy Moon DMZ. But the settlers there are just called 'refugees', so they might be from other places. Roboworld did respect that you don't bring weapons or soldiers to the DMZ, until a bunch of criminals sponsored by a rival foreign power broke that rule.

That colonel does beat the shit out of Little Deyzuna. But Little Deyzuna did desert his post to get into a barfight with a deserter without permission.

To find the name of an old anime!!,Help,"**Found :** Its Getbackers

**Little context :** It was around the year 2013 when I got know about an anime. I remember watching one episode (or one incident) and remember it well. I watched the episode in 3pg on a 128x160 screen. I liked the episode but couldn't watch the rest because of lack of internet. Don't know how popular that anime was as I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere for year. 

Here is the episode or incident I remember. 
There were 2 main characters. One with orange hair, orange t-shirt, green half jacket, half green pant and he were gloves. The other character was more simple, black hair, white shirt with simple jeans I guess, and he used to were black glasses. 

They had some super powers. The orange guy was able to generate electricity and hence used to wear gloves. The other had purple eye that can make people hallucinate. 

In the episode, the pair went to a warehouse in their car during the night because some group kidnapped a girl and they were taking shelter there. The orange guy rammed through the door with the punches and they got inside. Then the other guy removed his glasses and made everyone hallucinate that the warehouse was and they were too. This made majority of the enemies unable to move, even the girl was effect. After few mins the effect ware off but till then the orange guy saved the girl. 

That's what I remember. I have the mental image of those characters and will be able to recognize them. So if anyone have any idea please do let me know.",False,anime,1708355215.0,1aupg4g

Finding friends to watch anime with is harder than expected ,Help,"
Hello everyone, this is a bit of a rant but I’m also looking for some advice, so thank you if you’re reading.^^

I love anime & manga, I’ve watched 400+ shows and read 500+ manga/lns. I’m saying this because I want to be clear, I’m not new to anime and I’m pretty familiar with even the more questionable sides of the media.

Thing is, anime isn’t very popular where I live so wile I don’t really hide my liking of it, I don’t go out of my way to talk about it with others. 

I recently thought it’d be cool to make some anime-watching friends in my city so that we could go to stores, cons, and movies together. I joined a group chat that I found on Facebook (Facebook is still very popular here) and man… it was rough… 
Among other things there was a 30+ years old dude sending “memes” of naked lolis; a furry dude writing about his sexual fantasies while sending pictures of his furry-costume; a bunch of dudes making unfunny incelish jokes; a lot of “memes” about women having to stay in the kitchen and about how waifus are better than 3D girls; and when they found out one of the admins was a girl at least 10 dudes shoot the worst shot I’ve seen (asking for pictures of her face to “see if she was real”, sending cringe memes about imagining a future with her, askingfor her top10 anime of all time, etc).

I couldn’t take it anymore and left the group chat, I hate the word cringe but this WAS cringe af. I don’t mind being a weeb and talking about waifus or even hentai, but there’s time and place and most importantly CONTEXT, YOU CANT JUST SEND A NAKED LOLI OUT OF NOWHERE.

In your experience, are most anime fans like this? How can I find more “normal” ani-friends? ",False,anime,1708325618.0,1auh031

Yes I know this particular distribution company was widely loathed back in the day for their questionable way of handling anime, but they apparently paid their voice actors very well, so my point is that I can kind of see how they got away with their censorship practices.





In the end, getting anime legally dubbed and uncut is far more easy thanks to sites like Funimation, but it’s interesting to see how much has changed with the way modern anime is handled as again I find it hard to believe how distant the age of censorship feels now that 4Kids themselves have gone defunct.",False,anime,1708317291.0,1auemce

In the 80s on Showtime, there was some anime shows on. In one of them, humans could climb into the cockpit of large human-shaped robots. The one I have been hunting for is there was a young man being trained by a grizzled older military veteran. While training the new recruit, there was one scene where the veteran told the trainee, ""Confidence is your greatest ally, but overconfidence is your worst enemy."" 

Not sure if that was an entirely correct quotation,  as I was on the young side when I saw it. I have not found anything using Google, and it's been a little nag trying to find the title of the show. The robot was white, as far as I recall. If anyone could provide an answer, it would be very much appreciated.  Thank you for your time.",False,anime,1708310407.0,1aucg0n

Looking for Tactical & Strategic Anime Recs without a godlike MC,What to Watch?,"I'm looking for some tactical anime recommendations. Examples like:

* World Trigger  -   where everyone's working with the same tools, there's no sudden powerups to beat an enemy, the good guys not infrequently lose; 
* Kingdom        -      a war anime with excellent politics, tactics, and environment usage;
* HunterXHunter - the way nen works and interacts, plus some of the fights;
* Log Horizon   - 	where exact timing is another factor in gaming the system, each class has similar/same skillset, there's a smart MC but he's hardly the only one;
* Weak Hero     -      not an anime/manga per se, but a fighting webtoon where the weak MC uses tools to get around his lack of strength and his allies/enemies are frequently just as strong or stronger than he is;

More anime (not including above) that I've seen that kinda sorta fit this pattern: One Piece \[pre-timeskip\], Haikyuu, Hikaru no Go, Promised Neverland S1, Boku no Hero Academia \[ignoring later seasons\], Jojo Stone Ocean

Some things I really would prefer not to watch: Overpowered MC who beats everyone by breathing, whether in brains or brawn (or both). Even if the MC starts out weak, if they end up with more power than God by the last episode of the season, \*especially\* if everyone around them doesn't level up as well, it kind of ends up being boring in my book. Truly and completely boring. Unless it's One Punch Man. That guy rocks. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR -  I'm a huge fan of smart and strong ensemble casts, where strong internal (sometimes magical) rules have been created and both enemies and allies attempt to use those same rules, bend them, and/or think outside the box.

Mine are the Dynamic Togashi Duo of Yu Yu Hakusho and Hunter x Hunter (2011)

And also, if you're wondering why I chose 75 episodes as the bench mark, it was ~~to say fuck you in particular to fans of Monster and Chihayafuru who have a measly 74 episodes~~ because it feels like the cut off point between a medium length anime and a long anime.",False,anime,1708304074.0,1auaaih

Trigun - Anime of the Week,Weekly,"Welcome to the weekly Anime of the Week Discussion Thread! Each week, we're here to discuss various older anime series. Today we are discussing...

## Trigun

Vash the Stampede is the man with a $$60,000,000,000 bounty on his head. The reason: he's a merciless villain who lays waste to all those that oppose him and flattens entire cities for fun, garnering him the title ""The Humanoid Typhoon."" He leaves a trail of death and destruction wherever he goes, and anyone can count themselves dead if they so much as make eye contact—or so the rumors say. In actuality, Vash is a huge softie who claims to have never taken a life and avoids violence at all costs.

With his crazy doughnut obsession and buffoonish attitude in tow, Vash traverses the wasteland of the planet Gunsmoke, all the while followed by two insurance agents, Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, who attempt to minimize his impact on the public. But soon, their misadventures evolve into life-or-death situations as a group of legendary assassins are summoned to bring about suffering to the trio. Vash's agonizing past will be unraveled and his morality and principles pushed to the breaking point.

Welcome to Chaos - Interest Thread for a Dorohedoro Rewatch,Rewatch,"#***[Welcome to Chaos!](https://v.animethemes.moe/Dorohedoro-OP1.webm)***

-----

[What's up, r/anime?](#michaelwink) 

I’ve wanted to host a rewatch for this series pretty much since I first watched it, but put it aside as a “save for when a sequel is announced” sort of thing. Well, [a sequel *was* finally announced last month](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/192ai0e/dorohedoro_sequel_anime_announced/), and the only reason I didn’t jump on this *sooner* is because I was in the middle of hosting my Gundam Build rewatch at the time. 

Now that my schedule’s clear, it’s time to put that dream into motion!

[](#rengehype)

#***What is Dorohedoro?***

>Caiman is a person who has lost all of his memories after being transformed into a lizard-headed man by a sorcerer. Living in a grim urban region called Hole, he now hunts magic users in search of the one responsible for his metamorphosis in an attempt to recover his past and his face. Extremely strong and immune to magic, he has the help of his best friend, Nikaido. She is an agile fighter who runs a small restaurant at Hole. Their continuous slaughter of magicians calls the attention of a powerful sorcerer named En. He has his two best hitmen, Shin and Noi, target the lizard-man and his ally. As Caiman delves deep into the search for his former identity, he starts acquiring odd clues that lead him into the bizarre magic world.

[Dorohedoro](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38668/Dorohedoro) is a 12-episode horror/comedy/action series from [Studio MAPPA](https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/569/MAPPA), and when I say “comedy”, I mean this show is fucking *wild* from start to finish, and I assume it only gets crazier in the source material past where this leaves off. My go-to example of how wild this show can be is [the third ED](https://v.animethemes.moe/Dorohedoro-ED3.webm) (oh yeah, this series has *six* EDs despite having only twelve episodes, with all of them + the OP being from [(K)NoW_NAME](https://myanimelist.net/people/42050/KNoW_NAME)) because, I mean, just *watch* it. 

If you’re interested in having a fun time, now’s better than ever to hop on the Dorohedoro train if you haven’t already!

#***Wait, what even IS a rewatch?***

Rewatches on this sub are effectively the weekly airing discussion threads, but for older shows and usually paced at one-per-day rather than one-per-week. These are open to both people who haven’t seen the show before as well as those who have – any discussion of events past that day’s given episode *must* be spoiler tagged [using r/anime’s spoiler tag format](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/q28ulr/announcing_changes_to_spoiler_tags/), so as to not ruin the first-timers’ experience. Reading their reactions or having those reactions yourself is half the fun of a rewatch, you know? 

As an example of what to do if you’re too lazy to click on that link:

    [Dorohedoro]>!I want to eat gyoza.!<

Becomes [Dorohedoro]>!I want to eat gyoza.!< when you don’t break the formatting on purpose like I just did.

As for how to participate, just pick whatever you’re comfortable with. Some people do bullet point live reactions, some people write essays, some just show up to share memes or fanart and then dip, some solely respond to other participants rather than having a top-level comment on their own – anything goes as long as you’re not being rude! 

So, plan ahead on what you’re going to do, watch the episodes each day on your own, and be ready to jump in any time after the threads get posted!

#***What’s the schedule?***

The plan is for the rewatch to start a month from now on **March 18th**, with a thread for the specials on March 30th and the overall discussion thread on March 31st. I intend to post the threads each day at **6 pm ET**, the same time I posted this discussion thread (although depending on your timezone, it might be a *little* different when the rewatch starts since Daylight Savings hits mine on March 10th).

#***I’m in, where can I watch this show?***

Dorohedoro is available for streaming on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80991903), including the specials! Those are listed as “Episode 13 (OVA)”.

----- 

I look forward to eating gyoza with you all in a month!

Ping Pong The Animation 10th Anniversary Rewatch - Announcement,Rewatch,"[_Enter the hero! Enter the hero! Enter the hero!_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v6iOVhw6mQ)

### Intro

Hi everyone! There was an amazing response to my [interest thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1atc6xj/) yesterday so this thread serves to officially announce the Ping Pong the Animation rewatch!

Based on some feedback I got yesterday I've decided to adjust the thread times to be a little later so it's more convenient. Now the plan is to post at **2pm PDT (5pm EDT, 9pm UTC)**. The interest thread didn't actually account for US daylight savings time yesterday, but I think the conversions are correct now. If you live in a different time zone here's a [handy converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20240411T210000&p1=tz_pt).

There was also enough interest to include Tekkon Kinkreet as part of the rewatch so I've confirmed it into the schedule. That said, I couldn't find any legal streams for it. I think the Blu-ray / DVD is available on Amazon (a mix of new and used options). If you do know of any legal streams please let me know. Otherwise...

Anime That Share A Specific Element With Frieren,What to Watch?,"I have been having trouble finding more anime to watch as of late so I took a break for a couple months and am in the mood to watch some more shows. What oftentimes makes it a chore for me to find new anime are things like excessive fanservice, female characters being written poorly, generic main characters/characters in general, and repetitive plots. Frieren is a breath of fresh air as while the world itself is typical medieval fantasy, the characters are just so much fun to watch. The way the cast bounce off each other throughout their journey makes for some of the best television I've seen in a while! I am looking for more shows that feature characters with great chemistry with a well paced plot that is serialized. Some examples besides Frieren are: Record Of Lodoss War, The Legend Of Vox Machina, Avatar The Last Airbender, The Owl House, The Vision Of Escaflowne, Magic Knight Rayearth, and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.

Why you should watch School Days,Discussion,"I just recently rewatched it for a second time and feel like I had to speak out about it.

First of all, im bias because its my favorite romance ever but I learned recently that there’s a common opinion on the internet that it’s so bad that its only good for tricking your friends into watching it.

I’m also bias in a sense that I first watched it when I must have like 14, which has to be the real target audience. It’s a little dated and deserves critique for its cringe fan service camera shots, but it’s mostly only prevalent near the beginning and you can ignore it as it gets more plot focused very soon and stays that way till the end.

With that out the way here’s why you should watch it:

- Very short. Only 12 episodes long. Easy to follow. Unforgettable, even if you don’t end up enjoying it. The ending is famous and because it’s getting old, there’s plenty of new anime fans who don’t know about it and I think should.

- Very unique for what you get. Don’t you love anime that makes you feel? Anime that makes you cry hard? Feel hype af? Well School Days makes you feel anger, and I think it takes not only a unique motivation to want to make your audience feel that way but also takes a special talent to pull it off.

- Some like to watch anime like Overlord, Death Note, and Saga of Tanya the Evil because it does something different and the protagonist plays a villain type role. Well School Days is a romance that looks at other romance like Your Name or maybe Toradora and goes the opposite of that cute route and shows you that sometimes romance can also be really ugly.

- Some like Bocci the Rock, or maybe Komi-San Can’t Communicate because it’s the cute type of cringe people like to relate to. Well School Days will bring back that ugly cringe you wish to forget but keeps you up at night once you remember that thing you did. That might sound like a weird reason to recommend this show, but whether you relate or don’t, it’s the truth that teenagers are actually really dumb and the show uses this as a premise and takes it to the extreme so well! 

I’d love to discuss what people think of the show too! Just mark your spoilers so we don’t ruin it for anyone looking to try the show now ^^

I'm looking for an anime about friends just hanging out with each other or some cool romance.

Preferably it would be during school time but it could be at work too.

If it's possible I'd like to just give two points I don't like.

* Annoying characters like Taiga from Toradora (I don't mean Tsundere, I mean the girl who blames and attacks the main character for things he didn't do. E.g., like some girl hugs him or accidentally sees her underwear. Well that girl's fault)
* Without the MC who is a soft noodle. I mean where he doesn't run away at the sight of underwear and especially when a girl touches his hand. I understand that I gave school times where this may be normal, but maybe school times during high school, not elementary or middle school.

btw prefer without drama, at least without BIG DRAMA, small is accetable.

Edit 1. Prefer anime like 2015+ (maybe 2010+), i dont like old graphics

What's the weirdest/funniest plot you've ever seen in a anime,Discussion,"Bored, so lemme ask you a question: 

What's the weirdest or funniest plot you've ever seen in a anime? (short synopsis would be appreciated!)

To me personally it's probably ""Akikan!"". Remember watching it with a couple of friends and a lot of beer back in 2009/2010, had a great time! Here's the synopsis from MyAnimeList, I don't think i have to tell you why I love everything about it:

""Hobbies are often a great way of meeting new people, but how could  Kakeru Daichi, who collects rare juice cans, have ever suspected that  he'd meet a fascinating new girl when he attempted to DRINK her? Naming  her Melon, because she's got great melon... soda, Kakeru quickly learns  that she's an Akikan—a beautiful girl who's also a special can created  to fight other Akikans in a strange experiment to determine what kind of  container is better: steel or aluminum! Will becoming involved in this ridiculously twisted research project gone amuck complicate Kakeru's life incredibly? Of course it will, but  because Melon's steel body needs carbon dioxide to breathe, he's now  stuck with her since she's too CO2 dependent! And when his wealthy,  attractive, best childhood friend Najimi gets HER own aluminum Akikan,  the trouble really begins!""

Help me figure out the name of this anime ,Help,When I was a kid I remember watching this one anime. The main Character was a little girl who had a magical wand w/ a streamer at the end that would turn her into a grown woman. I believe she’d turn into a superhero and go on her missions then when she’s done she would turn herself back into a kid. Other details I remember were that there was some type of tragedy in the the beginning. Like a plane crash and the parents of that young girl were on that plane I think. She also had these cute little animal friends that followed her around. This was soooooooooo long ago so it’s an older anime. I’d say about 90s or early 2000s ,False,anime,1708285799.0,1au2ym5

"What Have You Watched This Past Week That is NOT a Currently Airing Show? [February 18th, 2024]",Weekly,"Title says it all - talk about the anime you watched this past week that are not a part of this Winter 2024 season (like **Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun 2nd Stage** or **Dungeon Meshi**), or a show that's continuing from previous seasons (like **Sousou no Frieren**).

With regards to Fall 2023 shows, however, it would be fine to write about them as long as you only began them after they finished airing. For example, it's fine to talk about watching **The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You** or **Arknights: Perish in Frost** if you started them after the final episode aired. Obviously, use your best judgement on this.

**Please use spoiler tags**; it's super simple stuff. An example below:

        [KonoSuba Ep 9] >!""THIS WAS A VERY BAD EPISODE, DARKNESS DID NOT DESERVE THAT!<

comes out to be [KonoSuba Ep 9] >!""THIS WAS A VERY BAD EPISODE, DARKNESS DID NOT DESERVE THAT!<

Who's your ideal anime boyfriend?,Discussion,"Anime fans often find themselves drawn to **shoujo stories** filled with **romantic clichés** that evoke feelings of excitement and giddiness. These stories frequently feature **handsome male characters** who embody ideal boyfriend qualities.

While the anime world offers a vast pool of potential anime boyfriends, only a select few truly resonate with individual preferences. These characters may be prominent figures or prefer to stay in the background, but they all contribute to the abundance of desirable anime boyfriends that viewers can't help but wish for in real life.

**Now, the question remains:** [who is your favorite anime boyfriend?](https://www.yualexius.com/2022/02/best-anime-boyfriends.html) **Choose wisely, as you can only pick one!**

What in the world happened with Horimiya?,Discussion,"Just finished it last night. Disjointed is the best word I could use to describe my experience with the show. Episodes 1-7 had me locked in with Hori and Miyamura's relationship. Mature, genuine, funny, and emotional. Then they become side characters, we see more SOL fluff of people we really don't care too much about, and the pacing is just light speed. It's not God of High School bad, but it sure isn't up to par either. I thought this had a shot to break into my top 5-10 Romance/Drama/RomCom series with the start, but that quickly blew up in smoke.

Can anyone spoil me on if Horimiya: The Missing Pieces has any more worthwhile relationship moments for the main couple? If it is just rotational SOL scenes for every character, I will probably put in on hold for a while. 

Is it still worth watching? Yes. The first 7 episodes are at least. I just don't understand why we were robbed of a 2 cour timeline for this show. SO much more room for it to breathe would've done wonders.

Watch Guide for Ranking of Kings + The Treasure Chest of Courage,Discussion,"Ranking of Kings (ROK) is a great anime with great and multifaceted characters, a complex story and a unique art style. The anime is based on the manga of the same name, although some content has not been adapted. The Treasure Chest of Courage (TCC), which was released in 2023, is a collection of mini-stories from the manga as well as anime canon stories that were shortened or omitted in the adaptation. Each episode consists of up to three mini-stories. Most of them are really not of great importance and rather insignificant.

Still, there were mini-stories and two whole episodes that I think were important and definitely helped me understand the characters better and fill in the gap at the end of the story.

I have therefore created a Watch Order of when you could watch which of the mini-stories from The Treasure Chest of Courage (at the earliest). If an episode has several mini-stories, the following numbering applies: 5.1 corresponds to the first mini-story in episode 5, 5.2 corresponds to the second mini-story in episode 5 and 5.3 corresponds to the third mini-story in episode 5. I have also highlighted the TCC mini-stories that you should check out!

\------------------------------------

* ROK 1-2
* **TCC 8.1 \[01:50 - 09:26\]**
* ROK 3-4
* TCC 5.3 \[16:39 - 21:19\]
* ROK 5-7
* TCC 1
* ROK 8
* **TCC 8.2 \[09:32 - 21:19\]**
* ROK 9-10
* **TCC 7.1 \[01:50 - 12:20\]**
* ROK 11
* TCC 2-3
* ROK 12
* TCC 5.2 \[12:57 - 16:34\]
* ROK 13-17
* **TCC 4, 5.1 \[01:50 - 12:51\]**
* ROK 18-23
* TCC 6, 9, 7.2 \[12:25 - 21:19\]
* **TCC 10**

\------------------------------------

But if you want to avoid stopping in the middle of the episode (at least almost), and you don't want to be pulled out of the plot too much, this would be my recommended Watch Order:

\------------------------------------

* ROK 1-8
* TCC 8
* ROK 9-10
* TCC 7.1 \[01:50 - 12:20\]
* ROK 11-17
* TCC 4, 5.1 \[01:50 - 12:51\] (5.2 and 5.3 can be watched too)
* ROK 18-23
* TCC 10
* Everything else

\------------------------------------

**The only problem is that**

1. **the Intro \[00:00 - 00:20\],**
2. **the Opening \[00:20 - 01:50\] and**
3. **the Ending \[21:19 - 22:49\]**

**of The Treasure Chest of Courage are spoiling the end of the story**, both with subtitles and with its images. And for some episodes there is the problem that only the first mini-story should be watched, because the following one is a mini-story that takes place much later and thus spoils everything.

**To avoid the problem**, I have given the time stamps very precisely. I hope that this will help.

I hope that I was able to give a few people a slightly better watch experience of Ranking of Kings.",False,anime,1708277636.0,1atzlt1

Anime similar to Kusuriya no Hitorigoto,What to Watch?,"This one has really caught my interest in ways I didn't expect as it's just a niche story disregarding all the wars and bigger conflicts going on outside the walls.

I love the setting and ost. The romance is very subtle, there are unexpected comedic moments as well which is great. I saw some comparisons to Kaichou wa Maid-Sama which I also enjoyed. 

If anyone can recommend similar, please let me know. Can also be chinese historical setting in general as long as political intrigues are the focus and not so much the battlefield.",False,anime,1708272040.0,1atxc3m
Which anime always drops the OP/ED during a scene?,Discussion,"I'm chasing the high from the latest episode of Dangers in My Heart's amazing transition into OP and ED during the last scene. I don't know why but I always find these scenes hits harder when the OP/ED is being played, then cues the credit scene.

For instance:-

* Most of [Mushoku Tensei S1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIOEnV7eztc) and [S2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcuziiPjm3I)
* All of [LycoReco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ5SFZU5fUc)
* [Hunter x Hunter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9jaHMnaUI) (Spoiler)
* All of [Oshi no Ko](https://youtu.be/Swy3v44GR0I?si=9DlGUXh1nYFU1_lb&t=11) (Big spoiler)
* [The Irregular at Magic High School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLPo7v16Y84)

Is there any other anime with similar style?

How taboo are spoilers?,Discussion,"I saw a Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation “fan” AMV that halfway through systematically spoils the rest of season 2 and some comments say season 3 also WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN AIRED YET

The AMV isn’t focused on fight scenes or fan service no it’s just plot points and twists one after another 

I was perplexed at first I thought they somehow stole the anime like it was already made but now released but no they animated it themself 

It will be years till the anime moves past this I know every pivotal part of the upcoming story for an anime I love I’m genuinely upset this is a literal worst case scenario for me my favorite anime was maliciously spoiled there will be no suspense or shock or revelations it’s gone

I saw this anime in my dream and i want to ckeck if its actually real,Help," 

The title is pretty self explanatory, but it's the second time I've seen this anime in my dream and I got too curious.

So the art style was very Neon Genesis Evangelion-esque, and it was about two guys, one I'm positive was named Hannibal (inspired by Hannibal Lecter, not Barca) but again I am not completely sure, and I don't remember the other guy's name. I'm sure that they had a romantic/sexual relationship, I believe that's what the anime was even about. I don't remember any of the plot, I just have pictures and faded clips, buy I'm 100% sure that it was like a dark romance BL kind of thing. It was pretty dark in general, most of the clips I remember are literally in absolute darkness or candlelight, but the other clips I remember are pink? I distinctly remember scenes with baby pink as their dominant color. I think the government is also involved in the plot one way or the other, the first episode actually started in like government head quarters or something. Generally, it was a serious anime, it wasn't comedic in the slightest. I know this sound a lot like NBC Hannibal, but I SWEAR it had a different plot; no cannibalism was involved. 

I don't recall looking it up after my first dream, but i find it suspicious that I saw it a second time. My dreams never make sense and perhaps this is my brain fusing media together and I'm tripping. Though Im almost certain that something similar to this exists. 🤷🏻‍♀️",False,anime,1708265029.0,1atusnm

Why are people outside Japan so against classifying anime by the Japanese imperial eras?,Discussion,"I actually had a discussion with a Japanese friend on how anime is classified in Japan after one person replied this to me as i want to see how a Japanese person thinks of anime being classified by the Japanese imperial periods and he told me that in Japan, most people classify anime by the Japanese Imperial era, and this guy thinks it's NOT an anime era and is not OK when clearly the Japanese people classify anime by Showa, Heisei and Reiwa and he also told me that the ""Gaijin"" way of classifying it is not wrong, but not correct at the same time

Not exactly looking for sci-fi/dystopian just honestly anything that has a similar art style/feel would be nice, but I'd totally love some more Japanese sci-fi.

Id like them to be movies because I kinda don't have the time to really watch full on shows but please also send some series if you think they're worth it!

Thank you<3

Edit: Also I forgot to add this but I'd prefer it if the animes had English dub. I know that's not possible for all animes so please feel free to still send ones with English sub but I'd like it if they can be voiced in Eng.

Level 1 anime enjoyers got absolutely gut punched watching first romance anime,What to Watch?,"I was doing just fine. Completely fine. Watching Dragonball z growing up, followed by Naruto (never touching Boruto btw) and more recently One Punch Man, Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen. And apart from the main characters, I will not be able to tell you the names of anyone else and… I only watch dub versions.

Then one day my girlfriend, who watches even less anime than me and more so doesn’t like action/fighting series in general requested we try a romance anime, as she likes romance shows.

After a little search we found HORIMIYA. Cute plot summary, very cute art style, let’s go. We ended up binging the entire show + season 2 and felt like we were robbed when it ended so quickly. So much so that we had to read the manga just to fill in more of the hole Horimiya left in our hearts.

It was amazing. It felt realistic. They are 17-18 year old high schoolers, they study and worry about tests, they hang with friends, they get sick, there’s rumors and love triangles, they get embarrassed by dumb stuff, the first kiss feels special and they fall in love naturally and quickly like teenagers do, they even have implied sex (I don’t care for sex scenes but both my gf and I were gasping when they hooked up and glad they didn’t feel the need to show more or shove it into our face - my girlfriend hoped for more sex is that normal?)

We like the ending, it was just over too quickly and WTF are the writers doing not giving THE BEST GIRL YUKI a happy ending with THE BEST FRIEND ANYONE COULD ASK FOR TORU. Hello??? Limbo state??? No. Make them an official couple immediately.

We rewatched it in Japanese just to have an excuse to watch it again and it was even better.

Anyway, long story short, it moved us. I even made a Reddit JUST let it out cause never felt like I was robbed of happiness before. And now we just need more shows like it. We are already on a YouTube binge of top romance anime’s to watch.

So, TL:DR question to you is, any anime suggestions similar to Horimiya PLEASE!?",False,anime,1708251905.0,1atr3jr

First of all I don't think I've met a single person who actually knows as anime exist and I will be very happy when I do because this is one of my favorite animes

You're such a unique twist on like sci-fi and the superhuman tropes of anime as well as has like amazing characters and character growth as well as an amazing and interesting story 

Also I'd like to mention the first opening is literally done uverworld And it is my Uverworld song Cuz it is just so good

As well as for a anime that's based off of a manga That's like from possibly like the '60s I don't know when but I know it's a pretty old manga It has beautiful animation

As well as I watch it dub and the voice acting for this anime is amazing It is so good

But yeah this is an anime I would say more people need to know about cuz it's kind of hard to explain what this story is about without spoiling it But it's a very interesting anime especially if you are a fan of sci-fi",False,anime,1708243429.0,1atp10e

How I got my brothers into anime,Discussion,"I wanted to share a funny story about how I convinced my three brothers to watch anime. They used to mock me for watching ""cartoons"" and say that anime is for kids, but now they are hooked and watch more than me!

It all started when I was watching Naruto and they walked in. They saw the fight scenes and the cool characters and they got curious. They asked me what I was watching and I told them it was Naruto, one of the most popular anime of all time. They were skeptical at first, but I convinced them to give it a try. I told them that anime is not just for kids, but for anyone who enjoys good stories, action, comedy, drama, and more.

They agreed to watch the first episode with me and they were hooked. They wanted to watch more and more, and soon they were binge-watching Naruto every day. They even started talking about their favorite characters, jutsus, and arcs. They became huge Naruto fans and they didn't thanked me for introducing them to anime. 😞

But that's not all. One of my brothers, who finished Naruto, wanted to watch more anime. He asked me for recommendations and I gave him a list of some of the best anime I have seen. He started watching them and he loved them. He watched Death Note, Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, One Punch Man, and more.

My other two brothers are still watching Naruto, but they are also interested in other anime. They sometimes watch other shows with me and they enjoy them. They watch My Hero Academia, Demon Slayer, Haikyu, and more. They also started collecting anime merchandise and posters.

So that's how I got my brothers into anime.",False,anime,1708241108.0,1atofsa

It's been over a year and I still haven't gotten over Renai Flops,Discussion,"I have no idea why this was so underwatched and so hated when it aired meanwhile other harem ecchi shows were praised to the ground. If you haven't seen it already, Renai Flops is a ""typical harem romance with ecchi"" with a billion cliches and stereotypes, however halfway has a gigantic switch which I won't spoil here.

The shift halfway was amazing, done so well, and I often rewatch past episodes to see if I missed any hints. The actual switch left me chills and I was so uncomfortable during *that* scene. Seriously one of the best episodes to air in 2022 and nobody recognized it.

Not counting the half mark, the first few episodes were fucking amazing. People kept trashtalking it and calling it degenerate and trash but it was one of the funniest things I've ever watched. If you like absurdist humour like Nichijou you would love the first few episodes. The humour was executed so well and dirty jokes weren't cringe. Each episode brought development to our cast and provided heavy foreshadowing for later.

After the insane plot twist and cliffhanger, we have a genre switch into a [Renai Flops]>!Sci-Fi!< type shit and also becomes a massive tearjerker while explaining every single shit that happened in the first few episodes. It was perfect and amazingly executed.

The last few episodes broke me. Look, I rarely cry in anime. Anohana, KimiUso, Angel Beats, they barely teared me up (though I do admit crying to K-On, Kakushigoto, Takagi-san), but Renai Flops made me cry in a way I've never done so before in fiction. I was fully invested in every second.

If you don't like ecchi stuff then sure pass this show on but it really is a gem. I admit some parts aren't executed the best, but it is incredibly satisfying and emotional. I was a changed person after watching it.

Renai Flops is NOT:

-a stereotypical harem

-just a dumpster fire ecchi

-a show with no development

-trash



However, Renai Flops IS:

-an emotional and well writen drama

-a hilarious comedy with appropriate amount of ecchi

-a show with lots of developments, advancements, high stakes, plot twists, and heart

-amazing



Do not be fooled by the cover. I never expected this show to hit so hard. If this post convinced anyone to watch the show, do it. It was worth it.",False,anime,1708232108.0,1atlzol
Yumemiru - Why are we so used to watching rom-coms that only get real in the last three episodes?,Discussion,"I´ve just finished watching Yumemiru Danshi wa Genjitsushugisha, also called The Dreaming Boy is a Realist. This is one of the animes you give the three episodes rule but even though you don´t like it quite enough, you just get curious and keep watching it. Although it is not even close to being a conclusive story, somehow it manages to bring a handful of likable characters, but there lies the problem: this anime is a perfect example of a painful standard that happens to many animes, especially rom-coms.

Since I first started using Reddit for anime watching, I just love to see episode discussions after watching each one of them, and it´s funny how common it is to find side characters being way more liked than the FMC, at least till episode 10. In Yumemiru, there is a clear reason for that.

Instead of developing the romance with the main girl Natsukawa, this anime focuses on continuously introducing new girls, that eventually start liking the MC. It´s not that bad and kind of what people expect watching school based animes, since harem is literally everywhere. But the standard of filling the 12-episode length with almost five other girls only to finish with a predictable main girl return is kinda disappointing. Don´t get me wrong, the main girl is perfectly fine, but why invest so much time with side characters if it just doesn´t add up in the end?

That´s why 1to1 animes, like Boku no Kokoro (The Dangers in My Heart) are so good to me, because there is always some progression along the episodes, and even though the end is predictable (we all know eventually they´re gonna end up together), it is worth watching and a great experience overall.

Besides that, authors never surprise us with a side girl route! No matter how good a side girl is, in the end, out of nowhere, the main girl will take her place! What do you guys think?

Are there are anime series that go from racy to mature in storytelling?,What to Watch?,"So basically I had an idea for an anime series that stars a protagonist who just wants to hit on women, but then slowly matures into a proper hero as suddenly the story takes a mature turn into something very interesting.




Like basically the concept is that the protagonist is very sleazy and the story is a racy tale that over the course  of the series learns to evolve into something richer where the racy humor is still there, but it gradually shrinks as the series goes on, so if this kind of show has a specific genre that it falls under, please let me know as don’t get me wrong in that I do enjoy anime series with fan servicey elements, but it’s just that lately I’ve been interested in seeing a series that goes from saucy to mature in storytelling is basically what I wanted to seek.",False,anime,1708227773.0,1atkpxw

Does anyone know this anime?,Help,"It’s about a small town that starts experiencing these killings right when some American workers/exchange students move in. Everyone lives in this apartment small complex and this woman has a son that stays in his room, someone finds him and he is covered in mold or spores, dead. These deaths continue and the towns people think it’s the Americans and the Americans think it’s the towns people. It ends up being this spore goddess that dies in the end but has been killing these people for like a sacrifice or something. In the end we find out the people in the town have been stuck in time, specifically 2009, I think. But every now and again they will get new items that have different time stickers on it. I think the first scene was a girl running with her friend through this hallway and this crazy guy is trying to kill them. He’s big as hell but if I remember correctly he’s super nice gentle and great with animals so I think the spore goddess got to him.

trying to find a mid 70s anime movie,Help,"Hi, I already posted this in another group but thought I should try to expand outside the box. To start off my mom’s trying to find the name for this one anime movie she saw when she was 10 years old. p.s. I made some changes after asking her again for clearer details. 
She doesn’t remember much other than the few details she has given me are:
- it was a movie, not a show 
- the main character was a girl or atleast someone on a quest. She mentioned there may have been a prince as well. 
- A blue and white flower (she also mentioned that this flower was to save someone’s life, like Tangled) 
- High up in the mountains.
- She has said it definitely came from Japan or atleast overseas, that the art style was very Japanese, and that it was dubbed in English. 
- She definitely remembers a line, “a flower of life, a flower of life, bring the life of ‘(someone’s name)’ back”  and has mentioned the name could’ve been ‘shin-shin’ she couldn’t spell it but said it sounded like that. (plus the dead character was a male and definitely Japanese, black/brown hair)
- She mentioned that the title could’ve been “(characters name) and the flower” or something similar but definitely was clear on the relation to the story. (I tried suggesting Mary and the witch’s flower but she said that wasn’t it) 
- that the art style was between realism and the well known 60s anime style. 
I was showing her some pictures of 1970s anime and she has said it was like the roses of Versailles kinda style (she said she has never seen any anime in 80s other than voltron but any suggestions from the 80s could be helpful)
-  likely mid 70s

thought I would add those in as well: she watched speed racer, kimba the white lion, and tobor.  
I never seen any of those except speed racer so maybe there’s an episode in one of those that could be a distant memory? 
She also has seen most of the studio ghibi movies so maybe there’s a movie with a similar story that she could’ve mixed up with. 

so far she has said it wasn’t Lun Lun the flower angel, Heidi alps, or the 5000 leagues in search of mother. 

Any help is greatly appreciated and thank you!",False,anime,1708218689.0,1athssz

Love & Left-overs: Why you should watch NieA_7,Watch This!,"[MAL](https://myanimelist.net/anime/800/NieA_Under_7) | [AL](https://anilist.co/anime/800/NieA-Under-7/) | [WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NieA_7) | [A YOUTUBER'S OPINIONS](https://youtu.be/yNidRSwwKSg?si=kc6l0Qfis1A_uk6x&t=2607) | [PICTURE OF A CAT](https://imgur.com/dqIAJBl.jpg) | [NO RELATION](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Yoko_Taro_cropped.jpg)
 

### The shortest pitch I can give (tl;dr) 

NieA_7 is a 13-episode comedy/slice of life from the year 2000, following the impoverished student Mayuko and her habitually useless alien roommate NieA through their daily lives. Some of the humour still lands and some not so much, but this show has a heartfelt side that's only gotten better over the years. If you'd like a mixed-tone work somewhere between *Aria* and *Ika Musume* and can accept a somewhat-scuffed production, absolutely give this a try.

### The longer and shorter of it

Alright, I lied. The actual shortest pitch I can give, at least to some, would be ""this anime is *in some sense* like a sister-show of *Haibane Renmei*, which remains well-liked"" - but this just begs you to ask ""in what sense?"". In one sense...: that Haibane is the dark-haired serious sister always trying her best, and NieA_7 is the anime-blonde gremlin creature causing problems on purpose. Which is apt, as NieA_7 (or ""NieA Under Seven"") is a story about [Mayuko](https://i.imgur.com/IDVDhDG.jpg), a serious dark-haired student working part-time jobs to make ends not quite meet, and [NieA](https://imgur.com/7CrJ6zE.jpg), her freeloading trash alien roommate, a general [rascal and nuisance](https://imgur.com/PAit9uW.jpg), two levels worse than the worst kind of alien, etc. So right away you've got the basis of a rough *boke* and *tsukkomi* pair, and the oddball hijinks that ensue as they try to keep their home (a room above an old-fashioned bathhouse) afloat in a struggling economy. 

By itself those are common enough, but NieA also brings a deeper well of emotional warmth that's as hard to describe as it is rare to find. You can really feel the struggle with poverty, Mayuko working multiple jobs while also trying to keep up with her studies, and the difficulty in not lashing out at those around you even when you know they're the ones most pinned under the same boots. This show was made following Japan's ""[Lost Decade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Decades),"" and it has only gained relevance as economic recession and hopelessness have lingered and grown wider spread. But this kind of dark foresight perhaps shouldn't surprise us, given the people behind the show.

### From the Stars

... And in another sense: we start during the production of the iconic *Serial Experiments Lain*, a dark psychological anime with an enduring reputation. Aiming for something a little less heavy to work on next, producer Yasuyuki Ueda picks out a cute alien from character designer Yoshitoshi ABe's notebook. ""Make this a manga,"" [the story goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbadywNSKTs), ""and we'll make an anime out of it."" I have to wonder what working with the guy was like; it sounds a bit intense! Well, NieA goes from notebook sketch to doujinshi to serialised manga, and Triangle Staff picks it up to adapt. Many of the staff from that project also work on this one; in addition to those noted above, I'd call attention to Youta Tsuruoka the sound director, who brings a similar focus on ambient sound and limited but lovely usage of background music when needed. Lain's, ah, *eccentric* writer Chiaki Konaka is notably absent here, though [a certain alien-loving technology-enthusiast Chiaki](https://imgur.com/Ka8Fswm.jpg) appears in the story in what I'd consider a loving cameo. 

There's also a fair few staff overlapping with the creators of *Haibane Renmei*, the next work by Yoshitoshi ABe and Yasuyuki Ueda. The shift to Studio Radix means there are more changes, but they retain talent like director/storyboard artist Tomokazu Tokoro, and the effect on the result is evident in the two having a similar ""half-iyashikei"" mood - where here, the ""healing type"" refers less to the fluffier, cute girls doing nothing genre (though it has a measure of that), but rather to a kind of gentle and wistful reflection on [loss and time](https://imgur.com/p4YZ6sG.jpg).

I also want to mention the opening theme, [*Koko made oide*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6zM_jcnkWA) by SION (Hideki Fujino). The absurdly croaked vocals are at first a little funny, but I grew to really like them - it has a kind of warmth and humanity about it, and the way that stands out against the electric instruments and the synth sounds at the start, it just really fits the spirit of the show.

Right, so, in conclusion... Am I forgetting something? Oh, right, yeah, in this story aliens arrived on Earth a while back, it was a thing-

### Addressing the [Allegations](https://imgur.com/MU7ACUI.jpg): Aliens, Stereotypes, Politics

okay, so. If you already know you don't care about this kinda bit, just skip it. But yeah, we oughta talk about there being aliens, and sometimes ""aliens"" means visitors from outer space, but sometimes it means people from one country who live in another. In NieA_7, they're the former type. You can see their giant, [classic-UFO mothership sitting in the skybox](https://imgur.com/4grQmDf.jpg) all jaunty-angled. So aliens from space are here to stay, after a lot of social discomfort and paperwork and being assigned a kind of rating system of personal merit by the governmen- *god damn it*. okay. They're both kinds of aliens, in a kind of extended but not omnipresent metaphor.

But, alright. The allegations. Yeah. There's some not so great stereotypes of actual ethnic minorities (in Japan), or, more specifically there's [Chada the Indian Alien](https://imgur.com/XMvxxNu.jpg), speaking the language badly, eating perilously Ethnic Food, being overly familiar with the women... basically a South Park character. Now, there are three points one can make. Firstly, he is an alien-Japanese person, not an Indian-Japanese person; is this talking about Indian people, or about *perceptions of them* by a kind of Universal Cultural Outsider? And then secondly, there's the episodic post-credits live action bit - an idea that would sadly never catch on - with [Dalgit the ""Alien Chada Image Consultant.""](https://imgur.com/bY78Hxx.jpg) I genuinely do not know if this is, like, extremely tasteless humour at the guy's expense, or if they actually ran the script past him to make sure it wasn't crossing the line. 

Thirdly, though, and most importantly -  as discussed above, NieA Under Seven has, at its best points, a sense of compassion about it that goes beyond didactic lesson-of-the-day stories. I like that there are immigrant stories that see them as, essentially, model citizens that just happen to look different, and I'm glad to see more like those. But I also like to think there's space for saying - well, so what if someone's literally the stereotype? [They're lovable anyway](https://imgur.com/BiHOHMP.jpg). 


### Identity

So, what *is* NieA_7? Is it a comedy with some iffy jokes? Is it a lesser-known *iyashikei* from the tail end of the genre's first peak? Is it politically-thematic sci-fi with denpa elements? I don't know. I think of it like an omelette made with whatever you have in the fridge. The flavours can seem a bit strange together; the bottom's a bit burned because there wasn't enough butter. The imperfection of it tells a story about when and how it was made that a more refined, restaurant-quality dish never could. I hope you'll give a thought to trying this show or something like it in the future.

Ping Pong The Animation 10th Anniversary Rewatch - Interest Thread,Rewatch,"
[_Enter the hero! Enter the hero! Enter the hero! Chant these words and I'll come to you..._](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v6iOVhw6mQ)

### Intro

Hi everyone! Seeing as the 10 year anniversary of Ping Pong The Animation is coming up I wanted to organize a rewatch. I have been a long time participant of /r/anime rewatches and have wanted to host one myself for a while. Given that this is a show I really adore, the timing of the anniversary, and that the [last rewatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/rewatches/rewatch_archive/2020#wiki_ping_pong_the_animation) was in 2020 I thought this would be the perfect time to host one.

### Background

You may be wondering ""What is Ping Pong The Animation?""

Originally adapted from the seinen manga by Taiyou Matsumoto, Ping Pong The Animation follows the lives of a number of  high school table tennis prodigies and the people around them as they learn to navigate the harsh climate of competitive sport leading up to the inter-high tournament.

The anime adaptation is directed by [Masaaki Yuasa](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=6940) of [Devilman: Crybaby](https://myanimelist.net/anime/35120/Devilman__Crybaby) and [The Tatami Galaxy](https://myanimelist.net/anime/7785/Yojouhan_Shinwa_Taikei) fame. He has an extremely distinctive style and consistently collaborates with a core group of producers, musicians, animators, and artists to craft an anime watching experience totally unique to the medium. In particular I'd like to shout out the now beloved composer [Kensuke Ushio](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=125625) who's first solo anime soundtrack credit was for Ping Pong and would go on to compose music for [A Silent Voice](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28851/Koe_no_Katachi), [Chainsaw Man](https://myanimelist.net/anime/44511/Chainsaw_Man), and the previously mentioned Devilman: Crybaby.

But apart from my words of praise, check out what other users of the subreddit have said of the show! From [2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2w34qj/wt_ping_pong_the_animation/) to  [2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/xejet4/wt_why_you_should_watch_ping_pong_the_animation/) Ping Pong the Animation has remained [extremely well regarded](https://old.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/lc26je/ping_pong_the_animation_thursday_anime_discussion/). It is ranked within the top 100 anime on MyAnimeList with over 200,000 users who have completed the show.

### Rewatch Details

I'm hoping to run the rewatch with 1 episode a day starting on the anniversary on April 11th (A little over 50 days from now). Threads would go up at 1pm PST (4pm EST, 7pm UTC) but I'm open to adjusting the times if you have suggestions.

Also, I thought it would be cool to include the [Tekkon Kinkreet film](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2154/) as part of the rewatch. It's another anime adapted from a manga by the same author of Ping Pong, Taiyou Matsumoto. /r/anime hasn't held a rewatch for the film yet so it could be a good opportunity for us to discuss it for a first time. What do you all think? If we include it we could discuss it on April 24th.

Preliminary timetable:

| Date     | Episode           |
|----------|-------------------|
| April 11 | Episode 1         |
| April 12 | Episode 2         |

I have watched some shows like Welcome to nhk, Mob psycho, vinland saga and idk that focuses on mental health.

I watched an anime in 2021 and now i can't find it.,Help,"I would have posted this in r/findanime but for some odd reason,I can't post there so here it goes. In 2021,while i was watching an anime in a popular site,i came across an ova with little views that caught my attention. I decided to give it a go and it was actually pretty decent. It was less than an hour and was made in the 2000's.
I searched up it's title and it resulted me finding out it had a blu ray release. I forgot about it until 1 year ago and now i can't seem to find it.
More details on the story would be that there was a war going on(for reasons i can't recall) and the first 20 minutes of the anime were filled with pretty much action between the two sides. I remember that there were fighting at night,on land and that there were a castle on the first side. The next detail i can recall is that one side had a secret ""weapon"",a woman of colour dressed very lightly who came into the battlefield dancing very eerily that either distracted them or killed them(i can't remember which). 
Something to note is that the cover of the ova was black and white with 2 women on each side. Does it ring a bell to anyone?

So what happened after JJK S2 Mappa Controversy?,Discussion,"Did MAPPA promise to fix the problems and improve their working conditions, and maybe pay more than a Mcdonalds salary to the overworking animators? I did some digging but all I can find are the old news of the animators breaking down during the production of Shibuya Incident Arc. Isn't the government of Japan or some anime-manga artists guild or some big shot mangaka are supporting the artists or speaking against MAPPA? 

I've just finished s2 episode 17 and while my mouth was agape during the entire episode -because holy hell that was probably one of the most brutal episode I ever watched on TV- I couldn't even criticize the obvious drop in the animation quality because of the poor animators suffering in a metaphorical hell in Mappa's Domain Expansion: Malevolent Workplace. I hope they unionize and sue the shit outta Mappa or something. I know that Mappa is probably just a part of the problem and the main issue is the entire animation industry but it could set a good precedent for others to follow.

Can someone living in Japan let us know if there have been any updates regarding this topic?",False,anime,1708198868.0,1atacb0

What long awaited anime adaption disappointed you?,Discussion,"We've all had one manga/LN that we waited years (if not decades for) to be adapted into an anime, and unfortunately it may not have come out the best. For me, it was Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer.  


For a lot of people, this was *the* Mizukami series we wanted to see adapted, and when the series finally got announced it, it felt like a celebration all around. That was until it actually aired.  


https://reddit.com/link/1at9e7v/video/dswyvezrz6jc1/player

The series was unfortunately rushed, and the clip above is just one of the many moments of QUALITY animation the series had. The VAs did a great job with the characters, but overall the adaption left a lot to be desired. After the first few episodes aired, the initial immense hype the series had was gone, felt very strange to see after years of people hoping an anime would be announced.

Hi guys, Hope you are all fine.

Just wanted some suggestion for anime. I want to start a new anime which has some decent sad story, nice devopment and good graphics. Just to mention I watched violet evergarden a month ago and it kinda felt like i should change myself.  
Want to get a similar type of anime maybe not the same category but sad story, character development is all i need for now.

A little emotional kind of story.

Movies can also be suggested if you feel one that is good enough.",False,anime,1708193168.0,1at843y

I want to get into amine, but whenever I've tried in the past I've only enjoyed niche shows or if I was watching with friends because of the social aspect; I watched Trinity Seven with an old roommate which was hilarious, and the first arc of Demon Slayer so I could see Mugen Train with friends in theater - though I haven't revisited the series since then. I liked Bleach as a kid, but tried rewatching as an adult and couldn't get into it. I like Fate/Stay Zero, but couldn't get into the other entries, and I enjoyed Hetalia Axis Powers, but that's not really a show of substance. 

I couldn't get into Naruto or DragonBall, but I liked yugioh and pokemon as a kid. Some cartoons I have enjoyed (as both a kid and an adult) are Teen Titans, Batman Beyond, Avatar the Last Airbender, Legend of Korra, and Invincible. 

One of my favorite shows of all time is Firefly but I couldn't get into Cowboy Bebop, though I'm open to retrying it, and a friend of mine recommend Castlevania (didn't hook me) and Blue Samurai (haven't watched) on Netflix. I will say, when Star Wars released the non-canon one-offs I enjoyed the episode about The Ronin, and I enjoyed the vintage Clone Wars, but I couldn't get into Samurai Jack.

I've accepted I probably just don't like anime, because where it seems like I'm picky my tastes still don't line up... But if you have any recommendations at all please let me know!!",False,anime,1708188827.0,1at6ell

The /r/anime Trivia Contest Starts at 1800UTC/1200CST Today!,Concluded,"##We're having a trivia contest! Details can be found in [the thread that was posted a week ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1aoo0w1)! We'll repeat some of the information here for ease of access. It starts at 1800UTC (2 hours from now)/1200CST. 

#Thanks everyone for joining! You can watch the [VOD here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2065576084) if you missed it! Join us next time!



***

#To join:

Go to https://play.blooket.com and enter the code that appears at https://twitch.tv/Dr_JWilson (we'll update this post with the code when we're live). Wait patiently for the game to start, and answer the questions to the best of your ability! Win those prizes! Which include...

A **$100 [Sentai Filmworks](https://www.sentaifilmworks.com/) Gift Card for the winner**, and a **year subscription to Crunchyroll Premium** for the runner-up!

***

#Participation Details

The trivia contest will be hosted today, February 17th, 2024 at 1800/UTC1200CST. This will be a **live** event! We will be using [Blooket](https://www.blooket.com/) in order to deliver questions and process answers, and the entire thing will be streamed [on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/Dr_JWilson). You don't necessarily have to tune into the Twitch stream, but you'll be able to see how you're doing on each question compared to your fellow trivia players, and most importantly... be able to  [**trash talk in chat.**](#trololol).  

&nbsp;

Also, if you couldn't make it into the lobby, we still encourage you to play along—that also goes for people who missed the event entirely and watch the VOD!

Blooket handles up to 300 players, which hopefully is more than enough. It'll be a first-come, first-served basis, and we'll start promptly on time with however many players were able to join. **You must use your Reddit username as your nickname**. This will be used to validate account requirements as well as be the final delivery means for prizes. And of course, **you may not cheat**, either by looking up the answers, discussing the questions with others, or impersonating someone else. Any evidence of this is grounds for immediate disqualification and potentially a ban from the subreddit. Let's keep this clean and fun!

Once again, the trivia contest will be hosted on February 17th, 2024 at 1800UTC/1200CST. Another post will go up the day of to remind people to join for a chance to win some great prizes!

#Prizes

How can we afford prizes you ask?

##[We've got Reddit money](https://files.catbox.moe/1vwh05.png). 
[](#shutupandtakemymoney)

The Reddit Community Funds program has afforded us the opportunity to experiment and try new ways to keep the subreddit fun and give back to the community. If this goes well and people have a good time, we hope to do this again!

First place winner, the one who successfully conquers the gauntlet of arcane and mostly useless (sorry) trivia knowledge, will receive a **[$100 Sentai Filmworks](https://www.sentaifilmworks.com/) Gift Card.** You could spend it immediately, but Sentai often has absurd sales, so you could get quite a lot of bang for your buck!

[](#seasonalhype)

Second place runner-up will receive a **year subscription of Crunchyroll Premium**! Crunchyroll has a great catalogue of shows and a number of good pick-ups from season to season. A year subscription is an $80 value that could free that money up for other anime endeavors!

#Eligibility

Now for a bit of disappointing news. Since these prizes are funded through Reddit, there are certain regional restrictions. Namely, in order to be eligible for prizes, you must be a legal resident of **the United States of America, the United Kingdom Australia, or Canada (excluding Quebec)**. You must also meet /r/anime's new account restrictions, namely **be an account older than 8 days and have more than 10 karma**. You must not be banned from /r/anime (duh!) and must be in good standing with the community.",False,anime,1708185653.0,1at578k

I can only remember this anime from this one clip I saw ages ago. Care to help me out?,Help," 

It was in a snowy area under a blizzard. There were 2 characters in this scene, one was male and the other might have been a female (they were wearing trapper winter hats so it was hard to tell). One of them was experiencing frostbite, so the joke was the other one would be peeing on it. They show the golden stream of pee spray, might not have been but possibly, on the face of the frostbitten person. From what I have remembered, this show was supposed to be a comedy series but with a very serious undertone at times.

Who's Your Favorite Anime Characters with Masks,Discussion,"&#x200B;

Anime characters with masks have always intrigued fans with their mysterious and enigmatic presence. But what is the purpose behind these masks? Is it purely for the plot or does it serve a deeper meaning? Furthermore, who do you think is the best-masked anime character? 

It's quite hard but it is definitely Zero for me.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xr2pkz10o5jc1.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2db743490b9752476e1f31a4279429477ceaf58

Zero from **Code Geass** is one of the [most iconic anime characters with a mask](https://www.yualexius.com/2023/10/anime-characters-with-masks.html). Also known as Lelouch Lamperouge, Zero is a master strategist who leads a rebellion against a tyrannical empire. His sleek black mask not only adds to his mysterious aura but also conceals his true identity, allowing him to operate in secrecy and manipulate events to his advantage.

•theres one scene at then end of the episode(dont know whic episode) where mc and his female friends need to enter a lift but theyre reach the limit so they have to take off their clothes (so only underwear remains) to they use the lift

An unexpected hero in Violet Evergarden,Discussion,"I especially like animes with deep themes that I can think about during and after watching. The more I notice the good planning and thoughts behind it, the more I like and appreciate it. \_I realised something about a character after the final movie (and this is just my perception):\_     

&#x200B;

 < Dietfried, Gilbert's brother, is seen as a villain at first. However, in the later parts a few more things are revealed. He refused to take on the role of a major, soldier, or just anyone in the army that his father had expected of him. In order to protect Dietfried, Gilbert took his place in doing what his father required. So, in the end Gilbert distanced himself from Violet because he took on full guilt of the harm that he caused in war, especially towards Violet, saying that someone like him did not deserve her. When Violet writes her last letter to him, in simple circumstances I think he might have just cried and let her go away.  

&#x200B;

Dietfried, who has started to have a changed heart when experiencing Violet's love towards his brother, voiced to Gilbert that he himself would carry the family name so that Gilbert would be free of his feeling of guilt, just as he had told Violet to be free. After this, he tells his brother to ""go"", almost like dismissing him from his previous role and encouraging him to leave his cage of guilt for love.  

&#x200B;

What exactly went on in the men's minds in this is a bit difficult for me to understand, or why the Dietfried's short statements were powerful enough for Gilbert to see them as authoritative. Maybe this is because Dietfried claimed his role as leader in the army as it actually should have belonged to him in the first place. Then, Gilbert would have acknowledged his brother's right to take his rightful role back. This would mean that he would respect an order from his brother, even if this order was to be dismissed of his position.  

&#x200B;

What I do believe is that if Dietfried had not said that he would account for the family's actions as this was his initial job, Gilbert would have lost the person whom he loves more than any other. The simple statement enabled Gilbert to start believing that he was allowed to be happy. From being complacent and planning on rotting alone in sorrow, he sprints after Violet with pure resolve and desire to be with her. Violet and Gilbert reunite and stay together for life, as it is implied in the after-credit scene, and as it says in the last LN that they get married.

A CHALLENGE FOR PROS! Looking for the name of an old anime,Help,"Hi, guys!

This will be a very strange request, but I'm looking for the name of an old anime. I watched it on TV with my dad when I was very very young (around 4/5, so it must have been early 2000/2001) but it has kind of stuck with me as a fond memory of a time we spent together and I would really like to find it and rewatch it. I don't remember many details but there was this petite girl with dark hair and everything was happening in the forest/mountains. I wouldn't be surprised if it's  a studio Ghibli anime, cause it had some very aesthetically pleasing nature scenes. I remember that there was a boy as well, but he was sick or injured and she had to take care of him. One particular thing I remember is that she had to feed him, but he couldn't eat on his own, so she had to chew the food for him and spit it in his mouth - I guess it grossed me out a bit as a child, so that's a prety vivid memory. 😅 I guess they were running away from something/ someone evil or there was some kind of danger and she had to save him.

Anyways, I hope that would suffice and your superpowers and deep knowledge of animes would help a poor girl in need. 😁 Thanks in advance!",False,anime,1708165246.0,1asyu7i

Am I a fool for expecting there to be a reason for a character to be reincarnated into other world?,Discussion,"There are quite a few isekai where the character is reincarnated into another world (as opposed to being directly summoned) but sometimes I feel Iike they just never explain why. 

When the explanation for reincarnation is never given, I usually give the show the benefit of the doubt and assume the reason will be given in a part of the story that the anime hadsn’t adapted yet, or maybe hasn’t even been explained con the source material yet either.

The thing is though, it feels like some of these shows aren’t interested in ever giving a reason. There’s no hint at an answer ever being revealed and nothing to give me the idea that the reincarnation into that specific world is anything other than a huge coincidence.

 I read the synopsis earlier for an upcoming anime where a girl gets reincarnated as the relative of a character in a story she was writing before she died. It’s too crazy of an occurence not to feel like it should have some meaning but  I wonder if it will. 

Am I just missing some Japanese cultural context of the widely known (over there) belief in reincarnation and when there’s no reason given in an isekai story for it I’m just supposed to be satisfied with  inferring myself that “it was totally normal reincarnation that just happened to put the character in that particular world”?

Shows like 7th Time Loop Villainess (granted, it’s not over yet) or ones where the character goes into the world of a game or book they have a special relationship with put the character in a world with highly specific circumstances relating to the protagonist which seem like they NEED to give a reason for why they were brought into that specific world but some just don’t seem all that bothered with that part of their story and you’re just supposed to accept it and move on.

And then, the kid would be having an internal monologue like, ""Alright, my mom was a bitch, but at least now I know she really loves me after all. I (sorta) forgive her for all the emotional and psychological shit they put me through for most of my developmental years.

bannana fish
cowboy bebop

solo leveling
moriarty the patriot
Ajin demi human
the dota show

I don't remember much all I remember is that people were fighting and dying I think. It was on the ""Starz"" channel back when Starz had anime on it.

Welcome back!


**Questions of the Day:** 

**1:** For those who played music in a group, do you have any fun prank or gag stories? 
 

**Comments from Yesterday:** 

 - A very large number of people linked Reina's little moment to Homura's hair flip. I should watch Madoka. 

- /u/Gaporigo [shares a comparison between the recap movie and anime episode versions of Rydeen](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1arszzf/rewatch_2024_hibike_euphonium_series_rewatch/kqltcu6/). In case this comes up: no, this rewatch will not cover the 2 recap movies. 

- /u/nintendomasterno1 and [a few of us really liked tired but satisfied Kumiko looking up at the sky at the end of the episode](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1arszzf/rewatch_2024_hibike_euphonium_series_rewatch/kqltdgk/). what a shot. 

- and then this was definitely the marching band people's episode! I present to you band stories and anecdotes from: /u/gamerunglued with [a lot of interesting details and trivia](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1arszzf/rewatch_2024_hibike_euphonium_series_rewatch/kqlu40l/); u/byroned on their more [modest marching band practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1arszzf/rewatch_2024_hibike_euphonium_series_rewatch/kqm15di/); and /u/mecanno-man on [turning corners during a march, as well as percussion instruments in a marching band](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1arszzf/rewatch_2024_hibike_euphonium_series_rewatch/kqm15di/)

- /u/zadcap dives into [Reina and Kumiko's body language during the budget-smile sequence](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1arszzf/rewatch_2024_hibike_euphonium_series_rewatch/kqnzwrt/)

**Spoilers**

As usual, please take note that if you wish to share show details from after the current episode, to use spoiler tags like so to avoid spoiling first-timers:

    [Spoiler source] >!Spoiler goes here!<

comes out as     [Spoiler source] >!Spoiler goes here!<

Please note this will apply to any spinoff novels, as well as events in the novel that may happen in S3. If you feel unsure if something is a spoiler, it's better to tag it just in case.

Please help me find an anime that made my mom really mad back in 2004 but was probably made on or before 2004.,Help,"I have no idea what anime this is and I can only recall a specific scene from it.

What I know:

* Aired on TV in the US, most likely had an English dub
* I don't remember seeing it anywhere else or ever again
* The scene I remember consisted of a woman standing outside of someone's apartment (or house or trailer), and the door was probably shut in her face (not angrily), and it seemed to be night outside, and possible raining
* The woman in the anime had longer hair, probably brown, or black, or blue, or green (some darker hair)
* The door was not slammed or violently closed, but rather, closed normally or gently
* The woman did NOT have blonde, white, silver or light hair
* She seemed relatively confused and/or hurt
* After the door was shut in her face and/or just shut by the person inside, the camera/frame focused on her, and she sighed
* The person shutting the door to them was male, most likely
* I don't remember any fantastic elements or sci-fi elements in this scene - seemed contemporary, but does not rule out those elements
* It seemed pretty serious, or at least not silly
* This had to be made some time before 2005, because the place I saw it I moved out of in late 2004/early 2005.
* We had satellite (DirectTV) at the time, and I remember seeing anime on several different channels, including a channel or two dedicated to anime, a channel related to TNT, and some others
* This aired during the day, and while possibly it was in the Toonami block, I don't see anything in Toonami that resembles it
* The show did not seem to be for kids, and maybe YA at the most
* My mom was REALLY ANGRY at this scene - she told me ""no, you're not watching that, it's so stupid, no, you can't see this, you're not allowed to watch this"", etc

That's all I know. If I recall other details, I will post them.

**Edit:** Some of the suggestions are good so far. Thanks for everyone who is helping me. I know this post looks kind of suspicious, but any help is appreciated. Narrowing it down, slowly but surely.

**Edit 2:** I found a website that lists all dubbed anime by decade. I don't know how accurate it is, but I'm going to start with the 1990s and 2000s. Site:  [A list of all Dubbed Anime ever Released in the United States | EDAL (english-dubbed.com)](https://english-dubbed.com/worth-reading/a-list-of-all-dubbed-anime-in-the-united-states/)

**Edit 3:** There were only several channels on satellite at that time that would have been airing anime: G4tv, Cartoon Network, and Sci-Fi (SyFy now I think). If anyone can think of any other channels that would have aired anime back at that time, it would be helpful.

**Edit 4:** This list includes candidates that Redditors have suggested. It is divided into two parts: Correct Memory and Incorrect Memory. Correct Memory assumes that I am remembering everything exactly. Incorrect Memory assumes I might have mixed something up or a made a mistake.

**Edit 5:** I added Rurouni Kenshin to the list because one of the characters looks similar to the scene I mentioned. Also, there is a chance it took place in older times. I distinctly remember there being no sci-fi or outright fantastical stuff.

*Correct Memory:*

* Love Hina
* Fruit's Basket
* Please Twins
* Macross
* Ayashi no Ceres
* His and Her Circumstances
* Burst Angel
* GTO
* Tenchi Muyo
* Ranma 1/2
* Maison Ikkoku
* Ai Yori Aoshi
* Elfen Lied
* Devil Lady
* Full Metal Panic
* Tenchi Muyou
* Excel Saga
* Rurouni Kenshin

*Incorrect Memory:*

* Rumbling Hearts

Oreyaba (Dangers) OP2 is really amazing the more you watch it,Discussion,"I feel like out of all the pretty darn good OPs we've gotten in Winter'24, Bokuyaba (Dangers of my Heart) OP2 is just on a different level for me.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0tKGpKOU4Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0tKGpKOU4Y)

The themesong by Atarayo! is obviously a big component of it, and it's rocking.

But Araki Tetsuro directed the animation for OP2, and OH MY GAWD the animation on this OP is truly something else.  Araki is best known as the series director of S2/S3 of Attack on Titan, and it's kind of amazing what he can do with a short 1:30 for a romcom. 

The small details get me.  

From the start of the OP to 0:53, almost every scene's color palette is darkened, both Yamada and Ichikawa in each scene being depicted primarily in shadows, with slightly melancholy expressions even in scenes when they are smiling.

The exceptions are very deliberate, such as several cuts where for example, Ichikawa is clearly Learning about Yamada's life as a model, and she, in Ichikawa's mind, is depicted smiling and in very stylish clothing and poses at 0:32).

The movement and animation are subdued.  Animated movements like Ichikawa pressing his hands against his face in shame (to the lyric about self loathing) are subtle.

Yamada and Ichikawa are depicted primarily alone, or seemingly alone even with other characters in the frame.

As the music enters the key line ""君の全てに救われて"" (my everything was saved by you) and the two singers voices begin singing together marks a huge transition.  The transition from 0:53 when Ichikawa says something to Yamada (sure seems like a confession), and the shadows and dark matted colors shift as the sunlight changes the color palette, multicolored flower pedals fly, and the wind blow back Yamada's delighted and surprised face.

Everything gets kicked off with Yamada taking a huge leap down a slight of stairs, seemingly floating in the air as the music takes a quick pause for a breath and your anticipation builds.

Then everything is well lit, covered in sunshine.  Ichikawa and Yamada are running through a seemingly multicolored spray of flower pedals, 

You transition to Yamada and Ichikawa dancing on a platform surrounded by all their friends, except at 1:08 - 1:13 when they wind up to make a heart together with their arms, the background pans around the gym that until a moment ago was filled with the rest of the cast is suddenly surrepiticiously empty, symbolizing a private moment together.

Which sets the stage for the final moment on the bench together, both slightly tense but clearly in love with each other, nervous about something that's about to happen.

I just love everything about this OP, I think OP director Araki hit this one out of the park.",False,anime,1708113547.0,1ashz3g

Need help finding a show I watched yars ago.,Help,"Sup, 

Recently I've been trying to find a show I watched a couple years back, but I can't remember it's name.

All I recall is that is that main character was a normal dude who's class was a villager, his childhood friend's class was hero, and his rich classmates' class was demon lord.

From what I recall, the episodes generally went like this:

MC would talk to his classmate, giving her general advice.

Classmates would have some wild interpretation of the advice to enact some long term evil plan.

The plan was seen as helpful by others much to her dismay. For example, I remember she gave everyone free air conditioned bus rides, and bottled milk from a farm she started in school because she wanted to contribute to global warming.

The hero friend would see through the plan and thwart her, only to get in trouble.

Every time I try searching for this show on Google I keep getting results about shows from recent years.

I'm stumped and am now asking for your help.

Thanks.",False,anime,1708108054.0,1asfrgp

Oresuki - Finally getting to know the meaning of flowers in the anime,Discussion,"It´s been 4 years since the release of Oresuki anime, but I´ve just finished watching it.

After going through all the episodes and the OVA, I read a comment on a Reddit discussion section that got me thinking about how I didn´t realize it till the end of the series: 

Oresuki is a complete flower metaphor!

First, all girl's names are based on flowers: Pansy, Cosmos, Himawari, Sasanqua, Asunaru

Then, what I thought was just a way to mention Oga-kun's shining personality, also has a meaning about teaming up with water and helping flowers to grow: Sun-chan!

And last but not least, we have the water supply metaphor: Joro means watering can, as shown in the anime beginning and Hazuki Yasuo - Hose (that was easy) indeed means hose. So, it basically means that although the hose can get a bunch of water to many flowers, it can also hurt them, by doing it on the wrong amount. Joro is different, it may look weaker, and way less efficient, but it just makes it all work by doing it carefully and thoughtfully, as the MC does till the end of the anime.

For me, that realization was pretty cool, and I thought about making this post to show my love for this anime even after all this time. 

That being said, Sasanqua best girl fr!

So , Looking for animes like the above where the world has altered history , some authority (world government/Holy Sol Temple ) controlling the world and preventing others from discovering secrets of this world which would impact the whole world and change whole perspective of that world.

I really like how you slowly discovered one and other plot point and you can theorize what could have happened and see the mystery revealed slowly as the plot progresses and compare with new plot reveals.

Another think I like is environmental storytelling too[like some clues about ancient world which aren't outright told but we can see in background like in paintings , carvings etc or some conversations between characters that take a whole new meaning when you come back to that part with more mysteries solved ]

There was this anime (Not sure whetever it was japanese but most likely it was) that was on television during early 2000's ( maybe 2007/8) in an Italian channel (italia1) but they stopped airing the show so  drastically.  
I was absolutely in love with that show but i cant remember the title.  
Both me and my brother have this memory so its not something i imagined.  


Plot:  
The main charachter was a young kid who was living in an advanced hi-tech society.   
He was wearing a cool watch that let him go into a another dimension.  
He was piloting  a huge robot that could talk.  
When the robot was transforming it was  sprinting through some rails like a train. (mario kart rainbow road vibes).  


This kid and his robot started to defend the planet Earth while fighting against some evil bots that had some ANIMAL features. I clearly remeber a robot looking like a Shark.  
Once these enemies were defeated in combact, they get purified and  become allies.

What to watch next with my friend?,What to Watch?,"Hey guys so I need some of your help & recommendations.

Over the past few years I've (23M) been watching a few great anime shows with my good friend (23F) and introducing her to some of my favorites in the medium. It's been great for our relationship and it's something I wish to continue. 

So far we've watched:

* Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood
* Death Note 
* Attack on Titan

We're currently on the last leg of Attack on Titan so I am now starting to think about what we could watch next. All of these stories are great, human, and with a deep emotional core that resonated with us and helped her connect to the shows and characters. That is why as I start to look for our next show that is something I am keeping in mind. 

Basically I'm currently thinking of undertaking Hunter x Hunter next as it has a super cool world and strategy element to the combat but primarily because of its beautiful core friendships and relationships between the characters. My question is do you think this is a good next step? HxH is a bit longer than the rest of these shows and isn't really truly complete but it is one of my favorite shows regardless which is why I'm leaning towards it atm. 

If you've got other suggestions I'm completely open to them as I'm here to look for inspiration. However please keep in mind that these should be aimed towards someone who doesn't typically watch anime so if we could keep ""anime-ism's"" to a minimum that would be amazing please. I'm specifically referring to fanservice and random s\*xual scenes popping out of no where bc I can't stand them and neither can she. 

Thanks in advance for all your help!!",False,anime,1708076061.0,1as4o26
What do we call New-Gen anime when they aren't new?,Discussion,"People call Black Clover, JuJutsu Kaisen, My Hero Academia etc. 'New gen' anime. Presumably because they are popular shounen anime that started after series like Fairy Tail, Naruto and Bleach. Also after One Piece got hugely popular, but that manga will outlast My Hero Academia by years at this rate...

&#x200B;

The Holy Shounen Trinity was the new-gen about 20 years ago, relative to Zeta Gundam, Dragon Ball, North Star etc. 

Within a decade the new-gen will likely end and be replaced with some other anime. There are always new spirit detective shows like Yu Yu Hakusho, Bleach and Jujutsu Kaisen.

I was wondering if there’s anything out there sort of in between Bunny Senpai and Jobless reincarnation. Does not have to be an action anime as JR kinda is.

Anime that have a Western appeal are better in dubbed. ,Discussion,"
When it comes to anime, anime not just set in japan but also set in every corner of the world including western world or european-esque fantasy setting, when i was watching anime on western european or american setting, i just watching it on english dub than japanese.

but there something that bother me and think of it example when watching something like Princess Principal, Vinland Saga or JoJo , where every character speak japanese even when speak to foreign and they are understand people like Chise or Horikawa or in episode 6 of Vinland Saga when Thorfinn was take care by English women and her granddaughter and when the viking invade the village Thorfinn was trying to warn the people, but they are not understand english (although everyone speaking japanese ) and there something like Appare-ranman where when the two main character in america everyone can speak japanese. Black Lagoon is another high class dub with western influences. Cowboy Bebop and Trigun are both influenced by westerns and sci-fi so the dubs were better. 

i think the english dub of that anime will giving an opportunity like using an right accent for the character in the setting or foreigners have some create unique than what japan just use some sophisticated dialect on noble or rich character and if the anime is set on non england or america they  may not use accent but they could use some phrase of that language example like Maria the virgin witch and Jojo part 5. 

so in my opinion i like watching anime that set in western with english dub for the better unique authenticity",False,anime,1708057479.0,1arzrb6
I’m trying to remember the title of this anime that aired on local tv when I was a kid.,Help,"I have been watching a lot of anime ever since i was a kid. Back then, I did not have any resources to watch anime that I like. I only have our tv to watch anime on. So there are things that I watch but don’t remember as vividly because it was such a long time ago. I remember watching a fantasy anime about this guy that has a tattoo (?) and gems (?) on the back of his hand and he summons his sort of like familiar wind spirit through that. This wind spirit has white hair (i think) and wings. The setting was I believe medieval because if I remember correctly, the backdrop of this show has a lot of houses and castles from the olden days (much like the ones on Nanatsu no Taizai or Claymore). Another thing that I remember is this main character guy had acquired a fire spirit of some sort and he had 2 gems on the back of his hand, 1 green for the wind spirit and 1 red for the fire spirit. This anime aired on local channels back where I’m from around early 2000s. 2005-9ish? That’s all I can remember to be honest. I hope someone can help lol I just want to watch it again for nostalgia.

The gist is that it's a scene where two people are fighting, and one of the outside observers comments on the two fighters' difference in ability.  Another says that they can't really tell the difference, but the former comments that to the layperson, all people would be seen as ""strong"" after a certain point, but for those who know what's actually going on, they would be able to see the details and difference in abilities (or something like that).

All I remember is that:  I first saw it in a manga and there's one panel where there person who's giving the explanation, and in the background has a person with a sprout on their head looking at a boxer shadowboxing thinking that they're ""strong"".

I would probably only be willing to acknowledge a handful of portal fantasy in the eastern hemisphere. The rest are probably worse than anything western YA authors could ever create. The oversaturation is understated. If I weren't aware of audiences subscribing to turn their brains off, I'd have thought it was anti-intellectualist propaganda. It feels like there's less and less competition in these literary/animated markets because people will consume anything. We are getting fewer and fewer compelling works of art. I've been looking around for well written mangas that could potentially get animated in the future, but most of them are works written in the very early 2000s. It just saddens me that the market is in such a state. I'm not free from the blame either.

Thanks everyone!



It was half animated, half live action- maybe with puppets? It's not ""X Bomber/Star Fleet""

I keep thinking the word ""Gemini"" is important.

The characters may have traveled through some kind of tunnel or tube system in a ship or craft.

There may have been a few different smaller adventures/adversaries within the overall plot.

It was likely not a series.  Just a standard movie format.

Any thoughts?

Why do people say Ghost in the Shell is philosophical?,Discussion,"It's been a couple years since I've seen it. I'm only a young adult and not very well versed in philosophical teachings and political theory but uh....I watched the movie, SAC s1 and half of s2. I don't remember it ever really diving into any philosophical topics. It felt more like just an older sociological piece. The philosophical counterpart to me would be something like Lain. Is there anything that flew over my head or is the ""philosophical"" label a bit misconstrued/exaggerated when it comes to this series? A lot of people use that label. I don't really remember it ever diving deep into the characters or ideas in the existential sense (also i know there are different categories of phil so please let me know if theres anything deeper to focus on that may have flown over my head).",False,anime,1708046043.0,1arvza3

LF Anime with a particular bracket system in a tournament,Help,"Hi everyone,  
Today I was discussing with my friends about tournament arcs and I remembered something from my childhood.

It was a strange tournament format where partecipants could vote for one of the other partecipants. Now I think i remember that they had to vote for who they wanted to avoid fighting and the most voted would end up directly in the finals. Maybe the mechanism wasn't exactly this but something quite similar. In fact the brackets ended up being very asimmetrical and some people had to fight all the way to the finals while someone else got direct access to it.

The most feared was a badass, I remember only that.

Oh and the anime is quite old, probably more than 10/15 years old.

If anyone knows the anime's name, please share.

Thanks in advance

  
**EDIT:**

I watched both the 1999 and the newer version of Hunter x Hunter and i don't think that's the one i remember. In particular in Hunter x Hunter the exam final tournament brackets are chosen by the president according to the partecipants' strenght, abilities and attitude.

What is the worst English dub voice you've ever heard in any anime?,Discussion,"For me it's Stephanie Nadolny's Goku.

Listen to how she raises her voice when she says ""I've ever seen"".) Her Gohan, while also not good, was at least able to avoid this issue, hence why I consider that her better role. There's other issues too, like her creepy Woody Woodpecker/Krusty the Clown laugh and how she just can't act very well at all. Her reaction to Krillin's death in DB is infamously terrible.

Help finding anime I watched as a kid.,Help,"I remember as a kid watching a show on one of the British kids channels. Now I can’t remember which one but it may of been pop? They used to air Pokémon from time to time and various other anime like shows. All I can really remember about this anime is the three characters. One being a tall blonde boy, a brown or ginger haired boy? (I remember him with spiked hair as such) Then a girl I’m sure her colour theme was pink or purple? Her hair either being brunette or purplish. It was sort of a Pokémon type esc show, they all had sort of creatures as pets and would battle with other people. I remember one distinct episode with the trio being on a ferris wheel, and that’s about it.
I did think this was digimon for so long, but it’s not the same.

Vinland Saga Season 2 Thoughts (completed),Discussion,"In my opinion, season 2 was a vast improvement over season 1. Not to say that season 1 wasn't necessary to build the foundation for season 2, but the execution of season 2 landed much better for me.

The most common criticism of season 2 is that it's boring, but I personally appreciate the slower and more introspective approach that season 2 takes, giving the characters space to reflect and develop. Thorfinn in particular. His multi-episode transformation from an empty, passively suicidal husk, into someone who has found a new purpose in life, was handled quite well. 

It was a very smart decision to move him from living amongst the violent oppressors to experiencing the other side of the conflicts that he participated in, but in a way that removes him from the trauma enough for him to make a genuine friend, touch grass, and reflect on his life. It gives him the chance to experience kindness from his enemies and see them as humans, but doesn't fail to later remind the audience that what his enemies are doing is fundamentally fucked (looking at you, Ketil). 

Only after Thorfinn has had time to grow does the series thrust him back into the more violent side of his reality, now equipped with the tools to at least start trying to find a better way to navigate the world. The stance he ends up taking is naive, but the series effectively communicates that his new perspective is largely informed by PTSD (fighting at this point is a constant reminder of the 10+ years of killing people that he just got out of, and is clearly something that triggers him), and isn't necessarily ideal, but better than what he was doing previously. 

Canute works as an effective foil to Thorfinn through this season, as someone who has developed in the opposite direction. Their confrontation at the end of the season makes for an excellent culmination of what the season was building up to, resulting in neither side overtaking the other, but rather a middle ground between the two opposing ideologies that these characters have adopted at this point. 

I love that the end of the season sees Thorfinn finally returning to Iceland with Leif, and I think it resolves the character arc of the first two seasons in an excellent way.",False,anime,1708017107.0,1arkhdt

Burnt out on anime to watch for a few years and need help!,What to Watch?,"Hey all! I started watching anime when I was 15 and was (still am) a total Dragon Ball fanboy. But being 23 now and trying to get back into the medium, I feel as my options are slim but I know that's only because I hate the idea of picking through millions of different things that I might not realize I don't even like until the third or fourth episode. 

Here's a list of some anime that I've finished or seen a bit over the years:

death note - all, dragon ball - most, dbz - all, dbgt - some, dbs - all, orange - all, btooom! - all, noragami - all, noragami aragoto - all, fma brotherhood - some, akira, cowboy bebop - some, neon genesis - some, tokyo ghoul - seasons 1 and 2, opm - season 1, Saint oniisan - only bits from what I can find online, berserk - all of the movies and some of the 97 show, so basically the golden age arc, naruto - tiny bit, one piece - tiny bit, aot - some, my hero - didn't like, jjk - open to watching more, demon slayer - big maybe

I practice martial arts and so I tend to gravitate towards those shows more. I'm not opposed to over the top power scaling, but if there's a grounded martial arts anime I'd love to see it. After watching Berserk, I knew I wanted more. Vagabond stood out to me but there's no anime to my knowledge.

I'm open to anime with religious themes as well; Saint Oniisan was so interesting and funny to me when I first found it, so it's a shame I couldn't find it all. I'm open to being told ""just finish this one"" too since I know a couple of these that I haven't finished are big names. I'm just so lazy when it comes to finishing something that I just write it off as it not appealing to me in the end.

Thank you all so much!",False,anime,1708006665.0,1argf78
Has anyone watch Detective Conan lately?,Discussion,"I haven't because the last time I watch it was around I can't remember. I just got tired and dropped it.

"Now we're halfway through Winter 2024, how are we feeling about the shows so far?",Discussion,"Alright! Happy new year and happy new season. Now we're finally halfway through the winter season of 2024, I wanted to ask you guys how your anime watch experience is going! What have you watched that isn't currently airing? And just how have you guys been now so many things are happening all over the world (good and bad).

Honestly, when browsing what shows to watch this season, I initially thought this was going to be a dry season. I still think it is, but it's just dry in name as there are not a lot of big IPs going around. We got Solo Leveling and a couple of others, but not quite the juggernauts of previous seasons. But even then, I found myself watching quite a few more shows this season than the previous one. And that's with school. A lot more surprises, a lot more action, romance and a lot more-

**So gushing over magical girls is a thing....** I honestly went into this show expecting almost nothing. I knew it was gonna be a lewd take on the MG genre, but since the PVs were quite tame (In comparison)... I was just.... My jaw was just on the floor the entire first episode. This was the very first show I watched this year and that alone gave me the message. I was not to take this season lightly. This show I'd say is best described as what if a Chef made a recipe with the main ingredients being slice-of-life, comedy, Mahou Shoujo and Bocchi the Rock... Then dropped in chemical XXX. It's absurd and degenerate to its absolute core, but you know what? I ended up loving this show so so much. I wouldn't call it my favourite show this season, but I do find it the most fun I'm having. The characters have so much charisma (Utena has negative charisma which turns back to positive), the magical girls are all adorable and funny despite the things they're put though, and while the production isn't really keeping up with the intense action, the lewd scenes deliver.... The studio absolutely COOKED with this one. The Opening and ending are also really cute. Check em out. I'm giving this a solid 8/10, honestly. I didn't expect to like this show as much as I do. It's also hilarious asf.

But *surprisingly enough* Gushing over magical girls isn't the only *tits out* Anime airing this season, **Mato Seihei no Slave** is another one that... unfortunately I don't think is as good as GOMG. I remember watching the first episode and feeling like something was missing. That the show felt like it was lacking. Sure enough, when I checked out the manga, I realized what it was. The anime pretty much sucked all the life out of the manga. The Mato world isn't as ominously fantastical rather just a baren wasteland. The monsters are CGI abominations rather than scary monsters, and unlike Gushing Over Magical Girls which does around 45% action to 55% fanservice, Mato slave does like 85% action to 15% fanservice. Because of this, you really feel it when the action can't keep up. Production-wise, I'm really not feeling this show and I think I'll just continue off with the manga. Also Tenka overrated. Never really saw what made her special. 6/10 anime, 8/10 manga. Also, come to think of it, isn't this also an isekai? It only crossed my mind as was typing this out.

Well speaking of isekai! I'm only really watching one isekai show this season, and I think that's for the best. Cause... oh boy, this breathes a ton of fresh air to me. Let me tell, you **The Weakest Tamer Began a Journey to Pick Up Trash** is unironically one of my favourite isekai I've seen for a while now. With a title like that, I almost skipped this show cause I didn't think it'd be worth watching. But when I saw the PVs (and eventually the show), it turns out that it wasn't a ""generic powerfantasy isekai,"" this title just so perfectly represents the show when I'm so used to ""The weakest X"" actually being OP asf. Just seeing Ivy adventure and find her place in this world with Sora gave me such a euphoric feeling. THE PRODUCTION! DEAR LORD! What the actual fuck went behind the scenes of this show? it looks beautiful. Episode one gave me the same vibe as when I first played Genshin impact. Such a vibrant world it just touches and cleanses your soul. It's a completely different type of aesthetic compared to something like say Frieren or Mushoku, but it's by no means lesser. The animation isn't out of this world (but still really really good), but the compositing especially with the water is just *cheffs kiss.* Although, I do have some minor complaints, don't really think the super dark past felt... not necessarily earned, but felt like it took the show in a completely different direction. The 180 personality shift that was displayed during episode 3 I don't gel with. Instead of feeling ""oh no..."" it jolted my head a bit and took me out of the experience. Still, a good 7/10 for now. I heavily suggest checking out the OP and ED for this one.

Still even if not isekai, there are so many medieval fantasy shows airing this season. **Dungeon Meshi** is one I absolutely recommend. It gave me the same vibes as Campfire cooking in another world, but the dungeon just lended itself to a far more interesting world. The world building in this show is actually just insane and entertaining as all hell. The way they recontextualize all possible monsters into something edible is both hilarious and interesting. Forgive the out of pocket comapison, but it feels to me a lot like Interspecies reviewers. on one hand, the concept of that show is insane, but the way they build on that premise to deliver such an entertaining story and world makes it a genuinely great experinece even without the ecchi aspect. The same goes for Dungeon Meshi, even without the delectable foods, the world is interesting enough to keep me engaged the entire way. Also while I think the foods in Campfire cooking look tastier, Dungeon Meshi's catalog of creatures just puts it above imo. Solid 7.5/10 and has the potential to go higher if the story has something more to offer (Which I'm sure it does.)

I won't dwell much on **Sousou no Frieren 2nd Cour**, I know it's great. you know it's great, let's just watch the amazing show continue being amazing. I think Yorushika's OP vibes with me far greater than Yoasobi's OP. Reading both lyrics, it's clear that Yoasoibi's OP was made for Frieren as in the characters mention in the OP is just straight up the characters in Frieren, but Yorushika's song just sucked me in more. Anytime Anywhere by Milet is a masterpiece, glad it stuck around. Also, unlike the previous cour, this cour is now really honing in on a massive arc. Before just had a lot of episodic adventures, the mage exams are really interesting to watch. Though as of the moment, I do prefer the more mundane slice of life aspects of the show sprinkled with more himmel and occasionally darker threatning threats. The demon arc is still my favourite arc in the show so far. 10/10. 

Since I already mentioned Frieren, I'll do the same for **Mashle -Magic and Muscles- 2nd Season** Since I do think it's just more of what I liked in Season 1. There's no grandiose change that wll leave me speechless, but a fun show that I can just turn my brain off to and enjoy like a giddy kid. I will say, the production in this season looks like a step up from the previous season and..... \[[Click for one of the best Openings this season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=210R0ozmLwg&ab_channel=%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%8D%E3%83%AB)\] Holy hell that blew me away. Another good 7/10. Recommendation, if you have a kid brother, watching this with him might be a good idea. I got a tiny brother, he absolutely loves Mashle.

Next up is a very VERY different type of fantasy. While a lot of medieval fantasy revolves around JRPGs which are mostly inspired by DnD which is mostly inspired by Tolkien's Middle earth which is inspired by Norse mythology and old english epics, **Majo to Yajuu or the Witch and the Beast**, feels like it's taking inspiration from a completely different type or culture of fantasy. I always appreciate it when stories do that. It reminds me a lot of Ancient Magus Bride that it feels inpspired by more celtic folklore which I find to have a completely different flavour from Middle Earth fantasy. The show itself has a really good atmosphere, really good voice acting and while some things are unsettling, it never feels out of place for the type of world the story is set tin. I love all the cast of characters. It breathes so much life into the world seeing so many people operate. Though, since so much is left unanswered (large mystery show), I'm giving it a 7 for now. 

Okay, more ""Fantasy."" I'm putting this one in quotations because uh... this anime is just senseless. I can't make sense of what they want me to think of this world where things are just all mangled together. They have elements of stuff from modern day japan but has the story take place in medieval fantasy and just doesn't explain anything. Though I don't think the show really intends to at all. It reminds me of Alice in wonderland in that sense. **'Tis Time for ""Torture,"" Princess** is a show I did not really expect to enjoy so much. I thought it'd be a fun little show where I'd get tired of the gimmick by like episode 2, but to my surprise, I'm still very engaged and I want to keep watching more. The cast is endearing and it's clear they're not really going for any strong sense of realism here and more just giving the cast a happy time. It's cute and fluffy. I'm enjoying this one over the fluffy isekai too. Giving this a good 7/10.

And ANOTHER FANTASY! Jesus, so many fantasy shows. This one doesn't go that hard on the fantasy aspect though from what I've seen so far. **7th Time Loop: The Villainess Enjoys a Carefree Life Married to Her Worst Enemy!,** this one I really enjoyed the first episode of, but slowly started to lose interest as it went on. I think Riche is a very fun protagonist, but I'm not really getting invested in her as a person. recently I started going on a deep dive on Manwha's and webtoons to find the true villainess show for me, unfortunately this one just isn't it. I also don't think the brooding prince is all that interesting of a character. He looks like a copy & paste of so many other emotionless princes that came before him. I mean, I can't really name a single characteristic about him that makes him any different from the others. I don't necessarily find that to be an issue. I truly believe great execution beats unique concepts all day long- buuuut, I do wish I felt more for his character. Production is good though, that dance sequence was a joy to watch. Kinda sad I don't feel much chemistry between the Prince and Riche. 7/10. AH- I also have come to realize that I don't really like it when characters act so formal towards each other when romantic tension is being established. This isn't just an issue with 7-loop, I found it with so many other villainess shows as well.

.....Another fantasy- OKAY! Another villainess show too. **Villainess Level 99: I May Be the Hidden Boss but I'm Not the Demon Lord.** Okay, bias aside, I have no reason to say this show is any better than 7, loop. In fact, I feel this show is just... way worse? BUT! I'm enjoying this one so much more lmao. The character of Dolkness I just find so adorable partly because of her kuudere but loud in the inside vibe (giving me strong flashbacks to Aharen-san which I really loved), but also because it feels like a villainess show... that meets your generic power fantasy isekai. I love it. Mayu Maeshima also doing the OP puts a smile on my face. Her voice and style of music just resonates with me. 6/10. This still isn't the villainess show I'm looking for though. So far the closest ones I've been able to find were ""I am the real one"" and ""Villains are destined to die."" But they haven't reached it yet. Oh wait, I just realized this is also an isekai lol.

Yumiella from Villainess 99 is a massive gamer, that being a central trait of her character. It was fun to see her talk about how much she's training and grinding and farming for mats and fighting dungeons and bosses... But that is merely child's play compared to this next show. This show In my honest opinion has just pulled it off. THIS SHOW is the greatest JRPG Anime I've seen ever made, **Shangri-La Frontier's 2nd Cour** was an absolutely insane experience. As of right now, the show seems to have concluded its first major arc and... GOD DAMN! I don't think I'll ever find another JRPG Anime that can just top this one. Nothing. SAO's Aincrad, Log Horizon, fucking Shield Hero, any show that tries to implement JRPG elements like Status and all that stuff I find Shangri-La does better. This show gave me the same feeling I got with Mushoku Tensei. I felt like Mushoku Tensei was the pinnacle of your typical isekai fantasy. The basic premise of truck-kun hits hikkikomori and reincarnated to another world without gimmicks, but done to a masterpiece of an execution, I find that logic applies to Shangri-La as well. The greatest Video Game Anime ever made. Maybe I just missed something else massive, but I honestly don't see anything ever topping this for the next many many years. Fucking 10/10. 

I need to take a breather for a bit \[Real time\] as typing out that Shangri-La Segment made me remember the recent ep and it just made me so feel so much hype again just thinking about it.

ANYWAY! There's another show this season that feels very game inspired, but not quite JRPG (since it's Korean). Solo Leveling is really living up to its title as being one of the best powerfantasy shows I've seen in a long time. Most of the time... actually I think this is the first time I've seen a ""powerfantasy"" show where the MC trains...  A LOT to get stronger. Some other PF shows do this too, but a lot of the times, they just skip through or montage the hell out of the training segments. This one though... it SHOWS you and because of that feels so earned whenever Jinwoo gets a power-up. I won't really say this does the game mechanics as creative and as fun as Shangri-La, but god damn this show is a different beast in a differetn Area. A-1 Pictures absolutely killed it with the adaptation and as someone who's been reading the source as the episodes progress, I can safely say this adaptation while not having as good art as the manwha, easily surpasses it in story. The little additions they gave added so much life that I find myself more connected with the characters in the show. Jinwoo's JP voice actor did a phenomenal job and Hiroyuki Sawano absolutely nails the epic soundtrack that this. show. needs. I'll keep my score a 7.5 for now, but only because I know it's gonna keep rising just like Jinwoo himself. Also I heard a youtuber call this an ""alright"" show because they thought it didn't live up to the manwha, I jsut disagree lol.

Right, now we've completely moved on from Fantasy to more sci-fi. in terms of production, Studio Bones isn't holding anything back and we get **Metallic Rouge.** Honestly, while this show just has absoluitely amazing production and vibes, I feel like the story's losing me every episode. The script feels off, the banter feels unearned, and the ""crazy villain"" just doesn't have a presence for me. I don't know what is it with the script, it's just so odd the way things progress, and I'm not sure if its because I'm just not getting it, or something really odd is going on. Naomi and Rouge's banter also doesn't feel that earned. In a lot of ways, they give off a similar chemistry to Takina and Chisato from Lycoris recoil, the only difference here is that I saw Takina and Chisato slowly get close as the series went on so when they eventually talk, I feel so much chemistry between them both. Here.... episode 1 they meet face ot face of the first time, episdoe 2 they're already bantering like siblings who've known each other for a very long time. I mean, they do, but the story just skips over so much of that development that when one feels bad or tries to apologise to the other, I just don't feel it. The villains are also just empty. One villain acts super chaotic and ionsane, but it lacks any kind of scary feeling. He acts a lot like Petelgeuse from Re:Zero, but he just comes off as cringe. I'm not sure if that's because of the direction or the story just not making him seem as scary as he should be. And that's just so damn tragic cause this show feels like a combination of Trigun Stampede, Lycoris recoil, and a third Sci-FI show I just can't name atm. Maybe I'll get a Danny Devito ""Oh... I get it"" once I rewatch it, but Yeah, I'm giving this one like a 5,5 for now.

Next Sci-FI **Brave Bang Bravern!** I... didn't know what I was getting myself into when watching this show. I expected a seirious grim story a-la 86 then suddenly BRAVEEEEEERN shows up outta nowhere then turns Game of Thrones into Eminence in Shadow. It's like if John Wick was running around then he had to fight the fucking power rangers. I can't tell if this is a good show, or just an absolute wack one. Either way, the show never ceases to be funny, I'll give this one an 8/10

Switching up the genre now, **Sengoku Youko** has been a very interesting experience for me so far. This is the only show this season that I didn't start because of the premise of the series, but the behind the scenes look at both the author of the source material and the studio adapting it. I'm sure most of you know by now, but the mangaka for Sengoku Youoko, Mizukami once had another manga that was beloved by fans in Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer (Hoshi no Samidare). He'd been excitedly pushing for its anime adaptation for years even when he started doubting himself thinking that maybe it just isn't possible after all. So when news broke out that it was gonna get an anime adaptation, Mizukami was so happy, there were twitter tweets about it you guys can look up. But it was clear that after a while, he was not really happy with how the production turned out. He was listed as ""Series composition,"" but according to him, he barely had any creative control over the project. Essentially, he just watched his beloved work get butchered right before his eyes. It was tragic. And now the anime has a score of 5.65 in MAL and 49% in AniList. It really was tragic seeing things end up that way. On the other end though we had Studio Whitefox. The studio that once delivered banger after banger such as Steins;Gate and Re:Zero felt like it was on its last legs as it slowly started losing staff. Some moving to Studio Bind to work on Mushoku Tensei and some to Altrei Pondarc (which included the previous director of Re:Zero). Season 2 of Re:Zero while being a massive project they had to put out. After that they just stopped producing anime. For a while, Studio White Fox felt like a dead studio that wouldn't really produce any more big anime much like Shaft was (before the new Monogatari announcement and Madoka movie). So the amount of joy that hit me right in the face when I learned that Mizukami's other manga was gonna be adapted by Studio White fox. And when I learned that this production was a far healthier one which Mizukami himself seemed to be very satisfied with and the studio bringing in very well animated episodes every week. The joy I felt was just... DAMN! This feels unfair to put a rating now since I'm still in that high where I'm judging the show more for the BTS rather than what it is. So I'll refrain from giving a score for now. I still 100% recommend checking it out though..... ALSO ONE MORE THING. Jesus, they should just call this show Sengoku Revival cause the amount of returns this show gave! The Singer of the ED was one of the Lead singers of Kalafina, and she once again worked with Yuki Kaijura to deliver an absolute banger of song. God bless this f'ing show.

My rant there went a bit longer than expected. Next! Keeping things suuuper short. **Apothecary Diaries 2nd cour** is just as good as always. Love MaoMao, love the world building and just her being the best girl boss MC we've seen in anime for a while 8.5/10.

And the last show before I end things off. I have some shows this season that aren't really seasonal shows like Cutey Honey 73, Shin Cutey Honey, Spice and Wolf, and more, but I don't want to make this post any longer lol. Anyway, **The Dangers in my Heart Season 2** is just the same goodness from season 1, but they keep adding more sugar every episode that my heart can't take it anymore! I genuinely do think this show is one of the best Highschool Romances we've gotten in the past 10 years. It's not really comparable to Kaguya-sama since both are very different writing-wise, but The Dangers in my Heart is so damn good. The progression feels natural with no step-backs. The characters grow and mature as the series goes on. The MC doesn't feel like lil loser despite his design making him seem like he is. Yamada is more than just a glutton. It's so damn cute! I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE! 9/10. Could go up.

So... yeah. Overall, this season surprised me way more than I could've anticipated. I expected this season to be so dry, but I was instead met wtih so many unique flavours I wouldn't have gotten if I just stuck by the big hitters. Going in blind is sometimes really really good, huh..

Anyway, that's enough of this, what shows have you guys been watching? what do you think about this anime season so far? what are your favourites, likes and even drops. I'm curious if you guys feel the same way cause this was just a surprisingly banger season to me. Cheers!

I don't normally do anything for myself on Valentine's Day, but this might become a tradition. Even just watching it by my lonesome was nice.

Like yes, I understand what exactly were the faults of the later half for many fans as romantic pairings like Futoshi X Kokoro were suddenly cut abruptly because the current writers decided that it would be a better idea to have her hook up with Mitsuru instead, but my point being is that while I do see the problems that would emerge in the 2nd half, I personally still had fun with the show anyway.




I apologize if this post causes any kind of conflict whatsoever, but it’s just that I was having a moment to myself, and I just simply wanted to express my views on the show itself, and again if that is a problem, please let me know, but I just simply wanted to look back at the show as it’s interesting to see how divisive it became as it went on.",False,anime,1707970188.0,1ar6swz

The pick-up round will be open until the final results of the seasonal salt Fall 2023. Max to three votes per voter.

***

## Mini Challenge: 

* As we now have 41 of the 44 candidates of r/anime ‘s best girl of 2023 (Remaining 3 will be decided by pick-up round result, you can see the candidates from past 3 seasons [here.](https://saimoe.miraheze.org/wiki/Seasonal_Salt_2023)) Make some bold predictions about r/anime ‘s best girl of 2023! 
* BTW, FYI, best girl of 2023 would not be immediately held after fall seasonal salt, it would start in early APRIL because we all know the two major contender show of fall seasonal salt both have two cours and are still airing now, which would very likely make the results strongly skew towards the fall season if we hold best girl of 2023 right in Feb, so I would wait until them to finish airing to enable a more balanced competition.

I'm trying to be less picky with anime, but after watching a bunch if stuff I just didn't really like i want to take a break and hope to find something I will be more likely to like.

I'm looking specifically for something where the MC is some kind of demon, monster, vampire etc like supernatural type creature. Can be part or full that doesn't matter too much. They can become on later in the show or early on.
I prefer more action based and less romance. Don't really care if its dark or kinda silly. 

Some I've watched and enjoy are:
Blue Exorcist,
Tokyo Ghoul,
Yu Yu Hakusho,
InuYasha,
Fairy Tail,
Toilet Bound Hanako,
Rise of the Yokai Clan,
Seraph of the End,
Attack on Titan,
Case Study of Vanitas,
Soul Eater,
Kemono Jihen,
Chrono Cursade,
Demon Slayer,
Seven Deadly Sins,
Bleach,
Black Clover,
Black Butler

I know it's a rather specific request, but I've always loved supernatural things, and I just want to find something else that peaks my interest. I know there are quite a few that are supernatural but the MC just stays human and something about it bores me more than I care to admit.

If you could recommend something I'd appreciate it, can also be manga I'm good reading if its not animated yet.

Future Diary is underrated. Go watch it,Discussion,"I unironically think Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) is an iconic, pivotal, and masterpiece quality anime.

1) Yuno Gasai is THE yandere. She's the character that has become the basis for the archetype of a ""Yandere"" in all of anime. Also name ONE battle Royale anime you can think of that was better executed than Mirai nikki.

2) The story is both engaging and well written. Great premise and combat mechanics. If you're watching Mirai Nikki, every episode is gripping and has you on the edge of your seat. Pacing is great. Minimal slice of life material, and almost everything that happens is relevant to the plot. It isn't predictable at all either, no one saw the plot twists coming.

3) The production quality is top notch. The sound design: the sound of diaries changing is haunting, the sound of explosions, and just sound effects are well designed. The soundtrack is amazing: watch the show and tell me the action scenes aren't hype thanks to the music. Animation is top notch too: great character design, fluid animation, and great shot composition. You at least have to give it that

The REAL reason people hate Mirai Nikki is because Yuno and Yukki are annoying. There's a solution to that: WATCH IT IN DUB.
- Yunos Japanese voice actress comes off as high pitched and whiny. Her American actress is a lot less annoying for American audience. People underestimate how big of a difference this makes. Same goes for yuki
- Yuki is roasted for being the most pathetic, weak protagonist ever. A lot of people mistakenly take this to mean ""bad character writing"". Yuki is SUPPOSED to be a pathetic, edgy, cringy loser. It's intentional for the plot. Notice how every other character has the same reaction to Yuki as we do: he's NOT supposed to be sympathetic and if you watch all the way through you'll see how he pays for choosing to be weak and letting yuno manipulate him.

Anime that is entirely flashbacks,Discussion,"I'm wondering if there is an anime that's entirely based on flashbacks, meaning that a character from the future could be retelling it, or a character recaps the plot, or it's all apart of the character's memory, something like that.

My favourite example for this is Kakushigoto because it has a mysterious aspect to what happened in the future as we get glimpses into how the past is like.

If this counts, Teasing Master Takagi-san seems to be based off adult Takagi's memories sometimes, as we see her going through an album or remembering the past.

I guess Attack on Titan could count too, Armin is basically recapping/retelling to us

Quintuplets might count as the bride's memories because we see flashforwards of the wedding often

Sub and dub viewing?,Discussion,"I watched Campfire Cooking in Another World  last year and it became one of my favorites,  recently, I saw that the English dub was available and I was curious regarding the quality of the translation and the voice acting. Three episodes in and so far the dub has been solid.  The storytelling and humor hasn't been watered down (adding a little extra inner monolog here and there helped)and the majority of the characters sound the way I imagined them in English (special props to the actors for Fel and Sui...they made me crack up all over again).

So...who else has rewatched a series after its been dubbed and do you still enjoy it? ",False,anime,1707939550.0,1aqvq80
What are some more of these warm/bittersweet openings?,Discussion,"What I mean by warm and bittersweet are these openings that use cuts of the characters just hanging out or going about their days to contrast other more serious things happening in the opening. Lately these are shooting up my list of favorite openings when everything is considered and not just the music or animation.

I found that these OPs tend to use gestures very well, which help to break out of the monotonous stock actions you usually see in anime like running, fighting, turning, just standing there, hand reaching, dropping into the water and all the clichés.

Do any of you feel similarly about this? What other openings do you know of that use this technique to help craft this sort of mood?

Looking for Anime that tell a complete story within 36 - 52 Episodes,What to Watch?,"As time goes on, I start feeling like 2 cours just isn't clicking for me.

The ones I've seen like Steins;Gate and Summertime Render feel like reeeeally long movies (in a good way). But they don't feel like... A series, if that makes sense. 

2 cours (20 to 26 eps) just feel like it's not enough to give me that fulfilling experience. I want to feel like by the end of it, I did go through this long story with the cast.

So I'm taking anything that starts at the minimum of 3 cours (36 eps) to the max of 4 cours (52 eps). Max of 4 cours because that'll be an entire year's worth of anime in one Binge. Also also! Good pacing would be much appreciated! I can take slow shows, but **slow** shows I can't. My preferred genre (as of writing this) is the more fantastical adventure ones like Lord of the Rings, so having a more ""fun"" story works great, doesn't have to be mature. I'll take a children's story so long as it can be entertaining for people over the age of 12 (I'm 19). 

This season's Sengoku Youko I've heard will tell a complete story within 37 episodes. That sounds great. 

There can be some exceptions like FullMetal Alchemist brotherhood where it goes for 63 eps, but for the lost part still fits? (I say 52 eps, but if something can seriously give me the fulfilment of the FMA ending, I'd take things that go over.)

Seems like the Precure series all tell the main story within 52 eps, I'll check that out. Any genre is fine really. Horror, thriller, action, Shoujo romance, shonen romance, adventure, fantasy, you name it. I'm open to anything so long as its engaging... But no slice-of-life, at least nothing entirely slice of life. 

Death note can fit here. It really did feel like a long journey with Light.

Attack on Titan fits in terms of the progression I want. It feels natural and the conclusion is one thst feels conclusive instead of the ""open to more adventures"" type of ending, but it goes over 100 eps which is way more than what I'm looking for lmao. If I were to pull something from western works (aside from Lord of thr Rings), how to train your dragon 3 felt like a true ending. I'm hoping for something like that. An ending where the story truly feels like its run it's course. 

I'm fine with long shows, so long as the pacing is okay. The issue in found with a lot of old shows (as in shows pre 2000) is how stiff a lot of shows are. I suffered watching shows from the 60s and 70s.

The show being split into multiple seasons is fine too, so long as they ultimately tell 1 big epic story rather than each season feeling like their own contained season. So multiple seasons telling one big story rather than 2nd season or 3rd season feeling more like sequels than a ""direct continuation."" 

Stuff like One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail, ~~Boruto~~ or really most long running battle Shonen's are out. They all go over 100 episodes and most of the time are filled with filler and padding.

On the common complaints I see against revealing armor and gear in fantasy settings.,Discussion,"I absolutely understand that minimal armor covering and form fitting clothing is less effective if you are only considering the pure protection that gear can offer a person.  If that is the only consideration, then every character should always be carrying a massive shield or just never go outside at all.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ygaqgm0jclic1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba1b118d2fa4ecdd0bbec41f09c2eddb6950a6f9

Consider the most common revealing attire you see people wear in real life, in public.  In my experience, it is fitness clothing.  Sports bras, muscle shirts, spandex shorts, small and form fitting items.  Why do people choose those clothes? Because they are easy to move in, which is also the most common response that characters use to explain their choice.  There is also the pride people get from displaying the fruits of their efforts, in the same way others can get from showing off their expensive fashion or other signs of material wealth.

If seeing any display of the things people are proud of is what makes you uncomfortable, I suppose this line of thought may not be very convincing.  But I think it is important to understand that most things in fantasy settings are metaphors for real world things.  For example, there aren't real dragons atop mountains of gold with a princess locked in a tower. But there are old rich people who hoard wealth and have partners that might appear to be unfitting matches for them.

Just something to consider. That said, I don't really hold it against anyone if certain things just make them uncomfortable.  I just think it is important to try to make sure your opinion doesn't ruin somebodies day and to consider their experience, too.

LOOKING FOR A SCENE,Help,"So there's this anime I watched a while back where I remember a character being some sort of a leader of a cult group and he had multiple clones of himself.

So the guy was maybe watching tv and said something like ""love is a beautiful thing that an incomplete human like me shouldn't dabble in"". something like that

Anyone with an idea where it's from?

For more information, there was also a part where the guy died and the remaining clones were debating what to do next.",False,anime,1707918151.0,1aqn5qq
Recommendation for good cardio anime,What to Watch?,"I’ve found the easiest way to stay distracted on any of the cardio machines is a good balls to the wall action anime.

"Obscure movies like: ""The House of the Lost on the Cape""?",What to Watch?,"Hi everyone,

I have obviously watched all Studio Ghibli movies etc. but in September last year I stumbled upon ""The House of the Lost on the Cape"" I and I was blown away by how good it was.

There wasn't much info about it on the internet and so I wasn't expecting that it'll have supernatural elements in the form of kappa etc. as no descriptions of the movie even mentioned it.

The art style was amazing, animation was incredible, story very good and it had some of the best music I've heard in any anime.

I'm not really into watching any anime series aside of Dragon Ball when it comes out and I really only watch anime when my partner is away, since she doesn't like it at all. She's currently away for a week and so I wanted to watch some good anime movie.

Long story short: does anyone knows about any other obscure anime movies worth watching and maybe similar to the movie mentioned in the title?

I'd really appreciate some suggestions :).",False,anime,1707912811.0,1aqlgy6

Anime Opening / Ending SONG that gives You strong Nostalgic vibes even if You do NOT know (or keep in mind) the context of it.,Discussion,"My picks (I recommend listening to the FULL versions, not the Anime formats):

&#x200B;

**Berserk's** Ending (""*Waiting So Long*""). It's naturally painful (which fits greatly within the context of the final episode, as well). Maybe too depressing, not leaving that much room for the ""sweet"" part in ""Bittersweetness"" that defines Nostalgia. It may seem more like Melancholy, I guess. But it still gives me the feeling of longing.

&#x200B;

**Oban Star Racers'** Ending (""*Waratteta*""). Probably the best one here after Berserk's, for me. Definitely better balanced than Berserk's, though. After the final episode of the show it hits even harder, just like Berserk's. And I'm not even a fan of this Anime ;p

&#x200B;

**Kill la Kill's** Opening (""*Sirius*""). It's so weird to have KlK here - an extremely action oriented over the top comedy show that doesn't have any particularly sad moments in it, but when I've recently started listening to the song separately, without looking at the images, I've realized how melancholic it is thanks to the chorus. 

&#x200B;

**Mushishi Zoku Shou's** Opening (""*Shiver*""). The official Music Video for this song is nice too.

&#x200B;

**Monster's** Ending (""*For The Love of Life*""). A really beautiful, hypnotizing piece.

&#x200B;

**Saint Seiya's** Endings (""*Blue Forever*"" and ""*Blue Dream*"").

&#x200B;

**Saint Seiya Hades'** Opening (""*Chikyuugi*"").

&#x200B;

**Shin Captain Tsubasa's** Opening (""*So Long Dear Friend*"").

&#x200B;

**Death Note's** Ending (""*Alumina*""). 

&#x200B;

**Shokugeki no Soma's** Opening **(""***Kibou No Uta***"").**

&#x200B;

**Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood's** Ending (""*Uso""*).

&#x200B;

**Naruto's** Opening (""*Namikaze Satellite*"").

&#x200B;

**Naruto Shippuden's** Openings (""*Closer*"" and ""*Diver*"").

Did Anyone See Ninja Kamui Premiere?,Discussion,"What did you think of Ninja Kamui Ep.1? Was it what you expected? Will you be watching this one this season? Did anyone else think it felt like a 10 minute short?  I caught the episode premiere by complete coincidence Saturday night when I just found myself wanting to see what is airing on the Toonami block in current year. What did everyone think of this one? Ninja Kamui? I enjoyed the episode though from start to finish. I’m super interested in where the show goes from here! I hope it becomes a big show for the block! For anyone wondering it’s on Toonami and HBO Max.


Also, for anyone interested in what I thought of the Toonami experience in current year:


Toonami looked like it was in a sad state. There’s the popular series to be expected (DS, Naruto, OP) and Lycoris Recoil I’ve seen online, but there were also a couple series that looked like American cartoons being marketed on the Toonami block. I didn’t recognize them. I was disappointed the block ended early. It used to go until 4am CST when I remember InuYasha used to play. It ended around 3am instead. I also remember for a time it started earlier back when MHA was on the block. Going from the usual 11pm to 10:30pm CST. Is this what streaming has done to Toonami? I love streaming, but I feel bad for the Toonami block. I have so much nostalgia for the block even though I was always primarily an online anime viewer and only a sometimes Toonami viewer. It was still an experience to just watch an episode of a show on tv again without context of the rest of the series. I’m not caught up to DS. I only just started the Entertainment District arc. Ep.5 aired that night.",False,anime,1707886660.0,1aqes93

I know that anime will usually have some loli in it and if there’s like an awkward scene or 2 I will just fast forward. 

I watched most of DanMachi and was fine with it if that gives a reference of what I am okay with watching.

"what is the objectively, unmistakenably, officially crowned most weebiest anime ever?",Discussion,"lets scale from normie to weeb to absolutely lost to us weeb. lets find out together:

the formula for it is how big is the fanbase divided by how known it is in the anime scene plus the square root of how many foreign dubs it got&how many viewers the show got in other non japanese countries to the power of how hopeless you are to have watched it in full.

thats how i concluded durarara is about a 6 on the weeb scale, lucky star is a 7 and yosuga no sora is an 8.5

rules are:

1) just being an ecchi or just being a furry anime or the likes of that no matter how extreme isnt a dead giveaway. highschool dxd was still massively popular, just like how beastars is also pretty big
2) itd be too easy to just go on mal and go to the bottom of the top anime list. instead anime that are just blatantly obscure, look like lost media or had 0 effort in them and like a 100 viewers in general or are just really old dont count. you should still be at least somewhat able to make out an audience somehow

Whats a mundane anime moment that you just can’t seem to forget?,Discussion,"To elaborate on what i mean. Whats a moment in an anime that is completely normal, nothing really happens in the scene that significantly impacts the story or the characters but something about the scene just permanently etches itself in to your memory for whatever reason.

In my case and if we are talking recently. I can’t seem to forget the scene from the dangers in my heart season 1 where ichikawa buys this matching keychain thing with his sister because he intended to give it to yamada as a souvenir from his trip but his sister thought it was because he wanted to have a matching keychain with her. Long story short his sister found out he wanted to actually give his side of the matching keychain to yamada and she leaves her keychain with him so they can match after she realized that he gave his keychain to yamada even though his sister was already using the keychain and was happy to share it with her brother.

Two things made this scene so memorable for me. The sadness that his sister might have felt (i know its a headcanon because it isn’t directly implied that she was sad) knowing that it wasn’t meant for her or just how good of a sister she is for letting them match.

I know its a stupid thing to think about but i just cant seem to forget it",False,anime,1707870822.0,1aq9hzs

opinion on ''rushed'' anime?,Discussion,"a lot of anime adaptions are unfortunate enough to be rushed, for a variety of reasons.

&#x200B;

while i do find it annoying that a really great manga just didnt get the adaption it deserved, i also contradict myself by enjoying them regardless as a ''alternate story''

&#x200B;

an example of this is Akame ga Kill

&#x200B;

the anime was pretty rushed imo, with a lot of arcs not appearing whatsoever in the anime, and i'll call the anime the ''bad end route'', whereas the manga finished the story, had a ''good end route'' and also got a sequal.

unfortunately, if you only watched the anime, the sequal manga would NOT make sense at all.

&#x200B;

and that takes us to the next point, and where my greatest irritation lies...

&#x200B;

glorified ads for Light Novels.

&#x200B;

there are SO many manga and anime that has ended short because they were just commercial product to get people interested in the Light Novels, one that i was so dissapointed was treated this way was ''Chivalry of a Failed Knight'', with the anime getting an even lamer treatment (aside from obvious good production value), i just find it annoying that a good story thats come far is now axed because they dont need it to commercialize anymore.

Why do anime characters immediately assume tears of happiness indicate pain or distress? Are they stupid?,Discussion,"“Wh-What’s wrong?” 

“Does something hurt?”

Bruh seriously, you just did something nice for the character, and they teared up because of that good deed. How can you not see the connection? It's pretty clear they're emotional because of the positive action, not because something's wrong.

lf animes with a very specific edgy vibe,What to Watch?,"don't exactly know how to explain it other than edgy and pretentious highschoolers daydream but in the best way possible. Cringe culture is dead <3

examples I can think of are code geass, pycho pass, death note, tomodachi game, no game no life, akuma no riddle, angel of death, banana fish, madoka magica, magical girl raising project etc

animes like monster also fit here,but I am looking for something that requires less braincells and more entertaining

basically edgy, smart and morally questionable mcs or those that are  narcissists with god complex (but also the type of character that will be worshipped on tumblr).

bunch of mind games, better if the mind games involve life or death situations, doesnt actually have to be smart or well written just should be important for the characters

generally dark and angsty vibes, better if the genre is horror but not necessary. 


also it would be great if it has some form of friends to enemies, enemies to friends/lovers, or some heartbreaking betrayal

if you read so far,  it would be great if you can drop some animes down. I do watch anime often, so more obscure or older titles are welcome.

Its okay if the anime is incredibly sexists or has weird stuff in it, I am used to it sadly. However I would appreciate if no excessive lolicon, no game no life was so hard to watch.",False,anime,1707862648.0,1aq6a7e

ANSWER TODAY’S QUESTION(S)

What is your favorite bottle episode of anime where it mostly takes place in one setting?

What do you think Maniwa has to say to Mrs. Ikari?

If Maromi is indeed Shonen Bat, how much do you think Tsukiko knows?

Bonus) If I had a nickel for every time Ikari has gotten isekaied, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird it happened twice.

Askeladd's back must hurt from carrying season 1 of Vinland Saga,Discussion,"Askeladd? More like Askechad. This man is the real main character of season 1, having more personality and depth in his fingertips than Thorfinn does in his entire being. Sad that he dies, but I understand why the death was necessary to revive the flat line that was Thorfinn's character arc throughout this season. Second half of the season was definitely better than the first, but I'm still wondering why they chose to make the protagonist the single worst character. The emotional beats of that death scene don't really hit when the protagonist has been insufferable the whole time and there's no reason to really care about his journey in the aftermath of the far more interesting character's death. Season 2 may pleasantly surprise me, but I'm not expecting much.

Option A) Light kills 10000's of criminals with a some innocent dying. But he stops all wars and 70% of global crime = millions of people are saved.

Option B) Light does nothing. Our current justice system puts innocents in prison/on death row (4% estimated on death row), wars continue on and the crimes continue on. 

Also our current justice system doesn't convict politicians or people who start wars. Light would.

I remember the characters having to use a watch gadget (could be sth else)to transform into their battle suits, their suits looked kinda like a mix of kaimen rider and power rangers, i seem to remember they were mainly white costumes.

I also remeber one of the episode plot was a concert/roadshow was under attack and one of the main characters lost his/her gadget and had to scramble to find it, and then the team arrived and kicked butt etc etc,

It could only be a one off episode in another show, i really cant remember, i was in the US and it aired between 1990-2010, or it could be on VHS tapes, i think i remember it having a english dub so it must have been localized.

Does anyone remember Angel Tales?,Discussion,"One night, I was scrolling through Tubi looking for a new anime series to watch and then I stumbled upon Angel Tales. It’s an anime about an unlucky unemployed man in his mid-20s, named Goro Mutsumi, who has trouble finding a job and is down on his luck until one night, he meets a group of teen girls who suddenly appear in his living room and they are his guardian angels who want to be of service to him. These girls are actually his previous pets that past away and were reincarnated into human angels, and their mission is to serve, protect and take care of him. Some of the girls had romantic feelings for Goro and were fighting over who gets to feed/cook for him, buy him medicine, make sure he’s safe, etc., but they were supposed to work together in being at his service, regardless if they were attracted to him. 

I really liked this anime even though I haven’t finished it all. It’s very adorable, sweet, charming, and childlike but it gets sad at times, especially when the girls talk about how they died as pets. This anime is 22 years old (aired in 2001) and I’m just now finding out about it. I highly recommend it to those who love cute or “childish” anime or magical girl, but I wouldn’t call it magical girl since the girls didn’t transform or didn’t have goals regarding saving the world. Their only goal was taking care of Goro. There’s 12 episodes and it’s available on Tubi.

art by anrio -- a collection of some of my favorite characters drawn beautifully,Fanart,"A fun way I've found to cement my love a show/character is to commission art of characters that I like...it's great! You get a bunch of great art, and you get to support real, human artists. You should all do it, regardless of who you commission!

Over the last...year and a half or two, I've ended up commissioning a lot of art, and in particular, a lot of art from an artist whose work I really love, anrio!

A gallery of his work that I've commissioned:
https://imgur.com/a/1PLCPqv

(actually, one of these got posted almost a year ago https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/12xif3u/i_drew_rem_from_rezero/ that was my commission ;)

Regardless, I really love anrio's style. I think it is true to the anime visual style, but also has a sort of...distinct, fashion inspired look to it? I dunno. I just keep coming back with characters I care about, and he keeps making incredible art.

How do you objectively rate an anime?,Discussion,"The recent post about “anime you think are objectively bad” had me thinking about this. Aside from stuff such as animation, voice acting, the art, which I think can be measured objectively in some ways, how do you call an anime objectively good or objectively bad? As in how do you rate an anime based on the more core aspects such as its story, the characters, pacing, plot development, etc. People often mention plot holes and inconsistent character writing but I feel like a lot of plot holes can be interpreted subjectively or might not affect someone’s enjoyment of the story as much as someone else. 

Also, how do you objectively compare two highly rated anime? For example on MAL, how would you objectively compare Hunter x Hunter to FMA:B, which are both some of the highest rated shonen ever, or Demon Slayer and JJK, how do you objectively compare those?",False,anime,1707834161.0,1apumji

1. MHA (This is the anime that gave me the most **radically** intense goosebumps, I've ever felt in my whole life, that i didn't even know was possible to experience, It also has one of the best OP's)
2. Fairy Tail: (I know, don't get me wrong, I am very aware that Fairy tail has some flaws (1. Ironically No blood when a character gets injured, 2. friendship power), but it's one of my first anime, at the time I watched it i was a lving masterpiece, the medieval-themed OST makes me literally experience euphoria, No anime **ever** beats fairy tail in OST's )
3. Tokyo Revengers: It has one of the best openings in the history of anime, The magical emotions I felt while watching it, The amount of tears I shed, The liberating experiences It made me undergo, The dramatic personality of Takemichi, The legendary delinquent, gang street fighting theme that was unheard of before
4. OP: Anyone who has watched long running anime, knows the profound bonds you develop with the characters, The way the drama is expressed here, is legendary, Luffy's character development is #1 in the history of anime
5. Date A Live: the G.O.A.T romance drama  + really great battles
6. Tensura: Every time I sit down to watch this anime felt like a breath of fresh air from life. It’s just so **fun**, it gives off a super tranquilizing vibe to watch + it has epic action scenes + crazy, Fluid animation
7. JJK: Self-explanatory
8. Kobayashi's Dragon Maid:  It's the best SOF anime I've ever seen, Nice storyline, very Funny, heartwarming moments, and most importantly, CGDCT <3 
9. Undead unluck: Very unique plot, magical OST and OP's , crazy events and gorey fights make it an immersive bizarre adventure

Why do people love anime so much? not trying to hate,Discussion," 

I have been wondering why people are so in love with anime and i am not trying to talk shit or hate.  


I have some friens i play games and talk to a lot in discord and they watch a lot of anime together in there but i never get the feeling that i like any of them, and i know many of you will say ""you have not found the right one yet"" but i have seen so many different ones now by just watching what they watch in discord its been animes like JJK, Hunter hunter, AOT, solo leveling, Spy x Family, Love is war and the list goes on

And i was wondering what makes people so obsessed with anime? Like i said i am not trying to talk shit or hate but for me from the outside people who watch anime are kind of like vegans, its all they talk about and only thing they talk about on the internet, all the pfp that they use is anime ones and all the gifs is always anime ones, I think its nice people have found something they really love and for me that is Lord of the Rings i watch that shit so many times a year i even watch so much lore videos to learn everything about it but i am not throwing it around everywhere that i love Lotr or even if i meet another guy that also loves it i just be like ""oh shit nice me too"" and i move on but i feel like a lot of people who love anime only talks about anime

So if anyone of you guys out there have any answers from your pov on what makes you be so ""obsessed"" with it

Kaguya Sama English Dub,Discussion,I’ve seen some controversy about this on youtube. Is this actually that bad or am I ok to proceed? I know people (myself included) don’t like major changes to the lines but I’m just curious if it’s really that bad on this one,False,anime,1707797701.0,1apkj0o
Animes like Highschool DXD,What to Watch?,"I want some suggestions for animes like Highschool DxD--I like the plot (not the ""plot""); specifically, the romance (not the harem) and the fighting/magic aspect to it; however, a little comedic at the same time.",False,anime,1707797579.0,1apkhl5
Favorite anime you know is objectively bad?,Discussion,"Mine has gotta be 7 deadly sins. I honestly get all the hate it gets but man this show will forever hold such a soft spot for me. I watched it with my best friend when we were both just getting into anime together and it was just such a fun show to laugh at and enjoy with someone, so many fond memories of this watch. I no longer get to watch anime with said friend anymore because we live a thousand miles away now. Sometimes watching anime by myself makes me feel a little sad because it’s not the same.

Edit: okay since I’m getting some flack on the title. Enough where a concerned redditor sent me a crisis line how about:

Animes like Yona of the Dawn OR My Next Life as a Villainess?,What to Watch?,"I've realized that reversed harem's are 10/10, but also bonus point when the MC don't even notice it (something Yona and Catarina share).

I just finished YOTD and I'm heartbroken about it being just one season, so I need to find something else to watch now. I really like everything about it. Following Yona as she grows into a stronger person, Hak always teasing and mocking her while struggling with his own feelings for her, all the other characters. The balance between being serious and dark, funny and sweet. 

Same goes for MNLAAV. Well, sort of. Catarina may not grow as much into a stronger person, not like Yona at least, but she's still growing. Again with the balance between serious and dark, then funny and sweet.",False,anime,1707793201.0,1apj0cy
What are some good animes on Netflix that don't have gross fanservice?,What to Watch?,"I've tried watching several popular animes, but they each had waaaay too much oversexualization of underage characters.

"When it comes to book based anime, how do people feel about it deviating from the canon?",Discussion,"Just asking as sometimes when it comes to anime adaptations of manga or light novels, sometimes the anime will deviate a bit from the source material by either adding in filler or expanding the canon.





I don’t know if it matters regarding adaptations,  but to me it’s an interesting move as while it doesn’t always work due to stuff like filler, there have been times when an anime adaptation of a book had deviated from the book such as Angelic Layer as while I am only a few episodes into that series, I often hear fans of the show saying that it improved the manga in some ways by fixing its faults, even if the show is not necessarily fully canon to the saga itself.",False,anime,1707791765.0,1apiifn
